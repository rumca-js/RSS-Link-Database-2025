The&nbsp;trio had hits including When Will I&nbsp;Be Famous? and I Owe You Nothing, before splitting in 1992. Matt went on&nbsp;to have a solo career, and recently concluded one of the longest residencies by a British artist in Vegas history. Bros reunited in 2017, coinciding with the Bafta-winning documentary Bros: After the&nbsp;Screaming Stops, which followed the fraught relationship between the twins, who are currently estranged. Matt will take his solo show on tour throughout March and April.</p><p><strong>This was taken in our biker jacket phase.</strong> I\u2019m wearing one by Rebel Rockers of London and I\u2019m ",
