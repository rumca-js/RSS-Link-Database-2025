So, I know the obvious answer might be \u201cyour local library,\u201d but, as much as I adore my local library, our ebook selection is\u2026 not the most ideal for me. I\u2019m gonna hate myself for how snobby I sound right now, but I tend to want books that are either a little more obscure or popular new titles that have a 6 month+ waitlist. While I usually prefer physical books, I have this issue where my boyfriend falls asleep insanely fast and I take a lot longer to wind down, so I like to have a book on my phone to read before bed while I listen to him snore. Because of the lack of good selection on my library app, I end up doomscrolling, which is also bad for my sleeping lol</p> <p>I looked into trying Everand, but the reviews are horrible. I\u2019m willing to pay for a subscription or something if it means I can find the exact book I want. Which ebook service is actually the best? If I have to buy individual ebooks, I\u2019m not opposed to that. I really would",

I was born and raised in the exact area the book is about - I\u2019m from the county his dad was buried at to be specific and I grew up going to the devil\u2019s bathtub. The author lives in the town beside mine as well, she\u2019s fantastic. </p> <p>Many of my neighbors, classmates, friends, and family members went through/died from opioid addiction. This read was tough but rewarding and beautiful. </p> <p>How did you like the book? Did it capture you as well, even if you have no connection to the area? I loved that it gave us hillbillies a voice and hopes and dreams, and gained nation attention/praise. 10/10 read for me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/catladybaby\"> /u/catladybaby </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1izb0x9/demon_copperhead_discussion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/book",
