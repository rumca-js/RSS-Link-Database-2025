I have no clue if there is anything on it. I don&#39;t know if the information can be retrieved off of it. All I have is the USB key and nothing else. I don&#39;t know how to go about this. Looking for help. Yes I would be more than happy to share whatever Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.. that there might be on the key if someone can successfully help me retrieve the crypto off of it, if there is any. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/WNd2k4a.jpeg\">Here is a link to a photo taken of the Crypto Key.</a></p> <p>Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alex_Under\"> /u/Alex_Under </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",
