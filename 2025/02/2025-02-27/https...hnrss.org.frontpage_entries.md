<p>Hi HN! My team at Efficient Computer (<a href="https://efficient.computer" rel="nofollow">https://efficient.computer</a>) and I are working on a new computer architecture and I am leading the team that is building the compiler for our chip. Our hardware is focused on energy-constrained embedded applications and is super efficient, which lets devices run for years on a small (ie AA) battery. We built a playground for our compiler that has a cool visualizer and debugger that shows how your C code (more languages to come) maps to our Fabric architecture, and an energy model that shows you how much less energy your code uses on our architecture. Check it out: <a href="https://www.efficient.computer/resources/effcc-compiler-playground-launch" rel="nofollow">https://www.efficient.computer/resources/effcc-compiler-play...</a></p>

<p>Hi HN,<p>I love newsletters. I first started signing up for Market Briefs right after COVID—trying to figure out why everyone was so scared of another market crash. It was exciting at first, but juggling a startup meant I couldn’t keep up, and soon my inbox was a mess of unread emails. I’d often ask myself: do I read them all, or delete and start fresh?<p>That’s why I built LoomLetter—a simple iOS app that pulls in all your newsletter emails into one place, lets you organize them into custom lists, and even reads them aloud using AI. I built it as a one-man project to solve my own problem of newsletter overload.<p>What it does:<p>- When you sign up, you get a unique LoomLetter email address for your subscriptions.
- All issues land in the app, where you can sort them (like “Must Read” or “Tech News”).
- The standout feature for me is AI-powered narration—turning newsletters into a hands-free. I parse each email’s content and use a speech synthesis API to generate the audio. It’s n

<p>Wampy is an interface addon for modern Linux-based Walkmans, which allows you to switch between standard interface and custom one using hardware Hold switch.<p>The project was born out of handful of standard UI nitpicks and "can I make a prettier UI?". There is no Rockbox port for my device (NW-A55), so I did a UI myself, unlocking and adding various features along the way, such as:<p><pre><code>  - Winamp 2 skin support
  - Custom cassette skins
  - Digital clock skin ported from iPod Nano 7g
  - Audio amplification table editor for S-Master HX
  - All audio filters are available regardless of firmware
  - Per-song audio filter options
  - Standard interface enhancements (add clock and increase cover art size)
  - Low latency USB DAC module
  - FM radio on devices with FM chip and Walkman One (A40/50)
</code></pre>
The result covers 6 models, from cheapest NW-A30 to premium NW-WM1Z. Development process involved a lot of reverse engineering, digging into device internals and was p

## Show HN: Ranked Search for Semi-Structured Data

<p>We’ve been working on a search problem that requires querying both text and numbers simultaneously. For example, in a dataset of clothing items with descriptions and prices, a search for “slim pants for $20” should prioritize skinny jeans for $25 over slim pants for $50 because they are semantically similar and the price is closer. I’ve found that standard embedding models struggle with numerical ordering, while text-to-SQL methods rely on exact matches and often filter out too many results.<p>To solve this, we built a system designed specifically for structured datasets like CSVs or tables.  Here’s a demo link where you can upload a small CSV to try out (no login required): <a href="https://demo.tryvoker.com" rel="nofollow">https://demo.tryvoker.com</a>.<p>Unlike most RAG approaches, we process each column independently, handling text with embeddings and numbers with custom scoring. When a user submits a query, we parse it into relevant fields—for instance, extracting “slim pants

<p>Hi HN! We're Roop and Puneet, the founders of Bild AI (<a href="https://www.bild.ai">https://www.bild.ai</a>). Bild AI uses machine learning to read construction blueprints and extract detailed material quantity and cost estimates. Here's our demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/vBDl7Mh7iEc" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/vBDl7Mh7iEc</a><p>The problem we're tackling is the sheer manual effort that goes into generating material quantities and cost estimates from blueprints today. Contractors and suppliers spend countless hours doing takeoffs by drawing on blueprints by hand - it's tedious, error-prone, and costs the global industry $30B a year. A single mistake can lead to thousands in losses on a project.<p>My co-founder Puneet experienced this firsthand as he was building hundreds of houses in Canada. Meanwhile, my background is in applied ML - I started at Google at 19, then Waymo where I built perception models for self-driving cars. Puneet and I met at Hack for Social Impact where

<p>Hi HN, we’re Stefan and Adina, and we’re building superglue (<a href="https://superglue.cloud">https://superglue.cloud</a>). superglue allows you to connect to any API/data source and get the data you want in the format you need. It’s an open-source proxy server which sits between you and your target APIs. Thus, you can easily deploy it into your own infra.<p>If you’re spending a lot of time writing code connecting to weird APIs, fumbling with custom fields in foreign language ERPs, mapping JSONs, extracting data from compressed CSVs sitting on FTP servers, and making sure your integrations don’t break when something unexpected comes through, superglue might be for you.<p>Here's how it works: You define your desired data schema and provide basic instructions about an API endpoint (like "get all issues from Jira"). superglue then does the following:<p>- Automatically generates the API configuration by analyzing API docs.<p>- Handles pagination, authentication, and error retries.<p>
