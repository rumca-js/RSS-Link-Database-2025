Some 35 years after experiencing an overwhelming sense of mild disappointment thanks to Ocean Software's Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the ZX Spectrum 128K, I get to tell you a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's movie hit is coming this September. But despite the furious march of technology, this one's also going to be 2D.

## Total Chaos is not the follow-up to five-star retro shooter Turbo Overkill I expected

But the follow up, Total Chaos, seems to be a very different beast. This is a psychological horror that involves creeping around corridors to find keys to unlock doors, while panicking internally about what's about to jump out at you next. It has survival gauges to keep an eye on, and there's a crafting system that lets you pick up wooden sticks and glue hammer heads to them, or make bandages from alcohol and tape you find. This is a game about surviving in an oppressive place, a game of atmosphere and strangeness. On the surface, the two games seem nothing alike.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-ch

A mobile offshoot chucked on the fire. A scattered, opportunistic attempt at brand synergy binned off after one attempt. Hundreds of talented people - with their families and their mortgages and their institutional knowledge that can, in worker hours, be measured in centuries - all discarded as a result. And one, lone executive departs after a "remarkable chapter", presumably with a big fat golden handshake for his trouble.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-hellish-decade-offers-a-valuable-lesson-to-gamings-power-brokers-sometimes-youve-nobody-to-blame-but-yourselves">Read more</a></p>
