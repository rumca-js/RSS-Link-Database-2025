You see, I bought this book about 3 years ago, and it had a really nice cover. I mean it in like a physical way. The cover was really really smooth, almost like a velvety texture. It was opaque, and overall really comfortable. I&#39;d never seen a cover in this material, and I really loved it! </p> <p>However, about a year and a half or so, I lent said book to a friend of mine. After I received it back, I noticed that it was kind of sticky. Like the cover and the back of it. I didn&#39;t gave much thought of it since I thought it could just be sweat or something like that, and I left my book in the shelf for like half a year. </p> <p>I recently decided to reread it because i love the book, but when I took it, it still had that sticky surface. I tried to clean it with some wet wipe to see if it would go away, but it did not. Now eve

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking to listen on Audible to a good apocalyptic/ dystopian novel or series. I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed He Who Fights with Monsters, even if it became a bit of a slog after the return to earth, sorry if I&#39;m giving spoilers. I enjoyed Robert Jordan&#39;s wheel of time series, even if there were some annoying bits about it. I know those two are completely unrelated to the book I&#39;m looking for, but I&#39;m letting you know, long series are okay, and I can handle any length of book or series. The longer, the better in fact if the plot keeps moving.</p> <p>There can be spicy bits, but I don&#39;t want it to be throughout the whole book over. Language is fine. Please no doomsday prepper centered books. It can mention it, but if it&#39;s a central theme, and keeps bringing up how they had prepper skills from before apocalypse event, I&#39;m moving on.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone have any book recommendations for books covering the holocaust, and the logistics of it? Preferably with some sort of picture’s or excerpts of Nazi German paperwork/documents? Ive been seeing an alarming increase in holocaust denial and Nazi propaganda (Allies started WW2, jews in germany died because the Allies bombed german railway networks so they couldn’t feed the prisoners, stabbed in the back myth, etc..) And i feel the need to be better equipped to handle and dismantle these claims. I only have the basic knowledge that is taught to you in US public school. Most Nazis consider survivors as “liars” so that’s why I’m looking for more of a direct documentation of the atrocities. I’ve added Joseph Goebbels various diaries to my list, as he was the minister of propaganda of the Reich, i feel like that would be a good place to start in terms of how Nazi propaganda works. However, the books are quite expensive, and I’m wondering if there i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>So I have been getting bored of romance books lately to the point where I can&#39;t finish the book I&#39;m on right now even though it is a good book. I need something new to kinda cleanse my pallet. I love romance but I also like stories about with mystery, or stories that are like Seal Team or sons of anarchy, or stories about marginalized and under represented groups of people both fiction and non fiction, I also like learning new things about science and law as well, I don&#39;t do too great with thriller/horror because I get scared easily but I am willing to give a good book a try. Basically I&#39;m up for anything lol. I would really love to read a book about Indigenous culture, traditions and experiences. </p> <p>I welcome any recommendations! Thank you in advance for your help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mean-Glass2126"> /u/Mean-Glass2126 </a> <br/> <span><a hre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m looking for books like the title. The action takes place at school (or not necessarily). The main character MC or other male character seems to be reserved and quiet, but in reality he is a psychopath, and when a new girl comes to school/class, the boy becomes interested in her. She doesn&#39;t notice him, she&#39;s not interested in him, she doesn&#39;t like him. He becomes crazy about her, he is jealous of her, but she doesn&#39;t know it. He annoys her, his pride doesn&#39;t allow him to say how he feels. It&#39;s a one-sided feeling and throughout the book he falls deeper and deeper into madness, he does terrible things to have her with him, but she is not interested in him at all, which only pisses him off. It&#39;s a dark romance, even a thriller, with no happy ending. Books, movies, series... Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Obvious-Safe6431"> /u/Obvious-Safe6431 </a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p> <p>I have been building on this idea since late 2020. It has been over four years. Initially, the plan had been to write a singular novel. But as I watched and read relevant topics to my field of study, I began to form ideas one by one, unfettered. I had an unwavering stance of implementing the entire story in the form of a TRILOGY for a long time. But then, THREE became FOUR; FOUR became FIVE; FIVE became SIX; and finally I have decided to conclude my story at &#39;EIGHT&#39;. I wanted to create a Universe akin to the Game of Thrones/Lord of the Rings/Dune/Harry Potter. The world deserves another top-quality Sci-Fiction/Fantasy/Dystopian novel series, after all. Presently, I am working on my THIRD and FOURTH Novel simultaneously, since I&#39;ve already finished writing my SECOND and self-publishing my FIRST.</p> <p>The first novel is available for order on Amazon, The Bookoholics Store and Google Play. It was published at the end

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m looking for book recommendations that can help me truly understand love and become a better partner. My girlfriend loves me deeply, but I feel like I’m not giving back the same kind of love and commitment she deserves.</p> <p>I’ve made mistakes—constantly cheating and lying to myself that it doesn’t affect her, but deep down, I know it does, probably in ways I can’t even imagine. I don’t want to be this person anymore. I want to change my perspective, my behavior, and learn to love her with the kindness, softness, and respect she deserves.</p> <p>If there are any books that have helped you become more emotionally mature, accountable, or simply a better, more loving partner, I’d really appreciate your recommendations. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoBlackberry8713"> /u/NoBlackberry8713 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/

Ottessa Moshfegh is excellent in her writing, she doesn’t need to go into excessive detail to make it disturbing.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Well. I am late to the party (if you can call it that) and I just finished ‘A Little Life’. At the very least it was both beautiful and devastating. I can’t find many people to talk about it to as it is now 10 year old. But, man oh man, the ups and downs, the beauty and hatred, the correlation and deception. I can’t even begin. </p> <p>I’m an avid reader but I have never experienced such a gap in what to read next. How does one follow ‘A Little Life’?
