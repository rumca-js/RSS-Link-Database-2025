When triggered (via some key combination), it would suggest a mix of actions and context-aware links based on the site. </p> <p>For example, if you\u2019re on your Stripe dashboard, it might suggest popular actions like \u201cRefunds in the last 30 days\u201d or show a text box where you can type an email and get a quick link to \u201cSee transactions from {email}.\u201d </p> <p>The options would be a mix of:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Predefined shortcuts</strong> (curated for popular sites at launch)</li> <li><strong>AI-generated suggestions</strong> based on context</li> <l",

Coming up with ideas and then destroying them constantly in my head is really draining. I guess (hope?) I am not the only one :P</p> <p>By accident I learned about thing called WebAssembly (basically you can execute pretty complicated programs locally in the browser without sending anything anywhere) so I immediately assumed that it could be used for a set of small, private tools. From the builder side - it is a nice bonus since you don&#39;t have to host backend.</p> <p>So I decided to not think a lot about it and just go for it.

No one will care about your product unless you make them. The system is built for businesses that can afford to spend on ads and promotions.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean you should quit.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in a similar situation, remember this: You started with nothing, and you\u2019ve already come this far. Success isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about persistence. If you feel like quitting, think back to why you started in the first place. Keep pushing, keep innovating, and don\u2019t let the world\u2019s greed stop you from achieving your goals.</p> <p>I reached 220K+ downloads without ad spend\u2014so can you! Keep proving to the world\u2014and to yourself\u2014that you can make it. And you will. \ud83d\ude80</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/karma_1264\"> /u/karma_1264 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProj",

But there\u2019s a problem: many entrepreneurs want to use these platforms but don\u2019t like being on camera.</p> <p>That\u2019s where I saw an opportunity. Businesses pay me to record videos promoting their products and services. I don\u2019t need to be an influencer or have followers\u2014just show up on camera and follow a script.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m building a platform that connects businesses needing content with people willing to record videos for money. Think of it like \u201cFiverr\u201d but just for short-form video content.</p> <p>Does this sound useful? Would you pay for this, or would you be interested in making money by recording videos? Let me know what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Green-Attention-1469\"> /u/Green-Attention-1469 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1iz2mup/are_y",
