<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I joined a new security team last year, and one major difference I noticed is how our SIEM (Splunk, on-prem) is managed. Our IT department controls it, meaning any requests for new data sources or plugins have to go through their approval process. We also have to submit tickets detailing exactly how to implement changes (e.g., clicking specific buttons, enabling/disabling features).</p> <p>I’m curious—does your team manage its own SIEM, or is it handled by another department? Do you use test environments before pushing changes to PROD? How do you determine who gets admin access, and what does your change management process look like?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/plaidknight_"> /u/plaidknight_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1izps1e/how_does_your_security_team_manage_siem_access/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecu

Companies should be thinking about how to prepare their teams for the evolving threat landscape, especially when it comes to emerging tactics like social engineering and AI driven attacks. It’s also worth considering whether it’s time to take a more integrated approach, where everyone, rather than just IT, understands their role in keeping data safe</p> <p>Also, how do we make training more engaging and realistic so employees remember it in the long term? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on what companies should be prioritizing as we move into a new era of cybersecurity.

## What Do You Think of the TryHackMe Security Analyst Level 1 Certification?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently came across the TryHackMe Security Analyst Level 1 certification while watching a YouTube video and got curious about it. From what I’ve gathered, it focuses on SOC operations, threat intelligence, and incident response, with an emphasis on hands-on labs and real-world scenarios. The certification involves completing guided learning paths on TryHackMe and then taking a final exam to test practical skills.</p> <p>For those who have taken it or looked into it—what do you think? Is it a worthwhile certification for breaking into cybersecurity, or is it more of a structured learning milestone rather than something that holds weight in the industry? Would love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Serious-Summer9378"> /u/Serious-Summer9378 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1iz76dj/what_do_you_think_of_the_tryhackme_security/">[link]</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, this happened about 4 or 5 years ago when I was working in IT. Our company also sold and installed cash registers, and we had just started using a new model of Sam4S POS systems that had an Android tablet built in. Since these systems were running Android, we figured remote access would be a great option for troubleshooting with customers.</p> <p>Our POS distributor provided us with a special POS version of TeamViewer Host—a software that allows for unattended remote access—so we could manage these POS systems remotely. Everything seemed fine until we actually tried to use it.</p> <p>When we went to connect to the POS terminal, we booted the TeamViewer Host app on the POS, it displayed a remote access code, which we entered into TeamViewer on our desktop. Instead of accessing the POS system, we suddenly found ourselves looking at someone’s personal Android phone.</p> <p>Confused, we thought maybe we mistyped the code, so we tried again. Same phon

A colleague of mine and I are having a debate on how to document time against alerts.
