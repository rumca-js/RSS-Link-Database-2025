“I can only remember it was November of 1979,” Marv Menzel says of Homestead Pickin’ Parlor’s opening day. “We didn't keep track of the date. We were in here, working on the facility, making the place comfortable for customers, and customers started walking in, so we accommodated them.”

Homestead Pickin’ Parlor has long been a destination for players and fans of folk, bluegrass, old-time, Celtic, and acoustic music. In its early days, Homestead drew the likes of Dakota Dave Hull and Peter Ostroushko. Today, musicians from such bands as Pert Near Sandstone and The High 48s pass through the doors.
