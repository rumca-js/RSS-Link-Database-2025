Right now, I\u2019m reviewing all my accounts linked to Google, migrating them to ProtonMail, updating passwords, and using Proton Pass. I\u2019m also moving my document backups to Proton Drive. Once that\u2019s done, my plan is to fully delete my Google accounts, change my phone number, and switch to a Pixel 6 running GrapheneOS (choosing the 6 for budget reasons and because I prefer smaller phones).</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on my approach\u2014would you add or change anything?</p> <p>Additionally, I\u2019m considering an alternative: using a Jelly Star phone with LineageOS. I love the compact size, but I\u2019m aware that GrapheneOS is the better option security-wise. However, I don\u2019t fully understand how much security I\u2019d be sacrificing with this switch.</p> <p>Any advice or insights would be greatly appre",
