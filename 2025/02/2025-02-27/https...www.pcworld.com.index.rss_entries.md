<p>Online backup is an essential hedge against any disaster that might befall your computer or local storage devices. Mechanical failure, acts of malice, or natural disasters are omnipresent threats to the files and folders you have stored on your PC.</p>

<p>Razer has teamed up with Microsoft’s <em>Minecraft</em> for a lineup of PC peripherals that evoke the game’s iconic Creeper and add in-game items to sweeten the deal.</p>



<p>There’s nothing particularly new here, just a “reskin” of existing Razer peripherals. They include the new $169.99 <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/minecraft-razer-blackwidow-v4-x/RZ03-04704100-R3M1">Razer BlackWidow V4 X Minecraft Edition</a> keyboard, the $99.99 <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-kraken-v4-x/RZ04-05180200-R3M1">Razer Kraken V4 X Minecraft Edition</a> headset, the $59.99 <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/minecraft-razer-cobra/RZ01-04650200-R3M1">Razer Cobra Minecraft Edition</a> mouse, and the Razer Gigantus V2 M Minecraft Edition.

<p>It’s taken a couple years, but regional sports networks are starting to realize they charge too much to stream local games.</p>



<p>NESN 360, which offers live streams of the Boston Red Sox and Bruins, just <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/02/24/nesn-slashes-price-of-dtc-service/">dropped its annual price from $330 to $240</a>, while also throwing in four Red Sox tickets. Main Street Sports Group, which operates regional FanDuel Sports Network channels, has <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/local-networks/fanduel-sports-networks-may-lower-price-streaming-service.html">hinted at lower prices</a> as well, and in some markets, local games stream for free or are available over-the-air with an antenna.</p>
