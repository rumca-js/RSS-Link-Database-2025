I think it might be one of two things (or both) but I’m not sure how to fix it… my two thoughts are:</p> <p>1) material oozing from the nozzle due to back pressure - this is PLA and I’m running it at 185 on a Kobra Neo with a new hot end. I did some temperature towers and it looked like -5 C from the low end part of the material range was best</p> <p>2) extra material being deposited at corners due to a pass for each connecting edge/face.
