<p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique used to “ground” <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335213/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) with specific data sources, often sources that weren’t included in the models’ original training. RAG’s three steps are retrieval from a specified source, augmentation of the prompt with the context retrieved from the source, and then generation using the model and the augmented prompt.</p>



<p>At one point, RAG seemed like it would be the answer to everything that’s wrong with LLMs. While RAG can help, it isn’t a magical fix. In addition, RAG can introduce its own issues. Finally,

<p>Microsoft has introduced a new AI model that, it says, can process speech, vision, and text locally on-device using less compute capacity than previous models.</p>



<p>Innovation in generative artificial intelligence isn’t all about large language models (LLMs) running in big data centers: There’s also a lot of work going on around small language models (SLMs) that can run on more resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and other edge computing devices.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s contribution is a suite of small models called Phi, of which it <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3624280/microsoft-introduces-phi-4-an-ai-model-for-advanced-reasoning-tasks.html">introdu

<p>Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has unveiled a significant price reduction for developers using its AI models, a move that could intensify competition among both domestic and global rivals.</p>



<p>On its website, the Hangzhou-based startup said that from 16:30 UTC to 00:30 UTC (11.30am-7.30pm EST) developers accessing its API — used to integrate DeepSeek’s AI capabilities into applications and web services — will see costs drop by as much as 75%.</p>



<p>Although DeepSeek labels this window as “off-peak” — it’s night-time in China — the discounted rates are available during business hours in the US, where the company’s competitively priced AI models have <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/art

<p>The C# programming language has provided support for thread synchronization since its earliest versions. Synchronization is used to prevent multiple threads from accessing a shared resource concurrently or invoking the properties or methods of an object at the same time. Synchronization ensures that multi-threaded programs run smoothly and don’t result in unexpected behavior.</p>



<p>This article discusses synchronization and thread safety in .NET and the best practices involved. We’ll examine the lock statement, the Lock class (just introduced in .NET 9), and synchronization primitives such as the Mutex and Semaphore classes. To work with the code examples provided in this article, you shoul
