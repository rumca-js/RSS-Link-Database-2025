Anything that can happen has already happened, or will happen.</p> <p>We literally don&#39;t have any way to know what Google is sending via Google Chrome. Google Chrome has access to the <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;</code> directory. They can technically steal all our text files from here. This includes all personal projects source code files and other documents.</p> <p>Is there any way to limit the access of Google Chrome to only <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.config/google-chrome/</code> and <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.cache/google-chrome</code> which is its default location to handle temporary data?</p> <p>Or, there is nothing we can do other than just permanently abandoning the Google Chrome forever?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",
