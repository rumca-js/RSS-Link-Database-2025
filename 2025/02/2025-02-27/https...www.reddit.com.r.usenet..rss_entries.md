<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I could use some help. Everything I&#39;m trying to pull from Usenet is getting stuck at 100%. Its not the decoding loop issue because it never goes to that step - The timer just goes to a &quot;?&quot;. Now I&#39;m down;loading to a network mapped drive because I attached my storage to a mini PC from my original computer. Even when I change my download folder to an internal drive on my original PC it still gets stuck though. It was fine for months before I made this change.</p> <p>Any ideas? Happy to provide further clarification if needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/schwandog"> /u/schwandog </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iznlzq/newsreader_stuck_at_100/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iznlzq/newsreader_stuck_at_100/">[comments]</a></span>
