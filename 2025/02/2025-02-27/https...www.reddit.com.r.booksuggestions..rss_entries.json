After I received it back, I noticed that it was kind of sticky. Like the cover and the back of it. I didn&#39;t gave much thought of it since I thought it could just be sweat or something like that, and I left my book in the shelf for like half a year. </p> <p>I recently decided to reread it because i love the book, but when I took it, it still had that sticky surface.

I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed He Who Fights with Monsters, even if it became a bit of a slog after the return to earth, sorry if I&#39;m giving spoilers. I enjoyed Robert Jordan&#39;s wheel of time series, even if there were some annoying bits about it. I know those two are completely unrelated to the book I&#39;m looking for, but I&#39;m letting you know, long series are okay, and I can handle any length of book or series. The longer, the better in fact if the plot keeps moving.</p> <p>There can be spicy bits, but I don&#39;t want it to be throughout the whole book over. Language is fine. Please no doomsday prepper centered books. It can mention it, but if it&#39;s a central theme, and keeps bringing up how they had prepper skills from before apocalypse event, I&#39;m moving on.

I don\u2019t plan on getting a job in this field but I\u2019m so interested in it, even knowing how they think or what they have to do on a daily basis, what medicine or physio workouts they recommend for different patients and why. Does anyone know of any books that can help me learn about this field? It can just be medical stories, or it can be a book written by a doctor, or it can even be a beginners guide. Any help appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Reflection-6602\"> /u/No-Reflection-6602 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1izjizh/medical_healthcare_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1izjizh/medical_healthcare_books/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I need something new to kinda cleanse my pallet. I love romance but I also like stories about with mystery, or stories that are like Seal Team or sons of anarchy, or stories about marginalized and under represented groups of people both fiction and non fiction, I also like learning new things about science and law as well, I don&#39;t do too great with thriller/horror because I get scared easily but I am willing to give a good book a try. Basically I&#39;m up for anything lol. I would really love to read a book about Indigenous culture, traditions and experiences. </p> <p>I welcome any recommendations!

The main character MC or other male character seems to be reserved and quiet, but in reality he is a psychopath, and when a new girl comes to school/class, the boy becomes interested in her. She doesn&#39;t notice him, she&#39;s not interested in him, she doesn&#39;t like him. He becomes crazy about her, he is jealous of her, but she doesn&#39;t know it. He annoys her, his pride doesn&#39;t allow him to say how he feels. It&#39;s a one-sided feeling and throughout the book he falls deeper and deeper into madness, he does terrible things to have her with him, but she is not interested in him at all, which only pisses him off.

Initially, the plan had been to write a singular novel. But as I watched and read relevant topics to my field of study, I began to form ideas one by one, unfettered. I had an unwavering stance of implementing the entire story in the form of a TRILOGY for a long time. But then, THREE became FOUR; FOUR became FIVE; FIVE became SIX; and finally I have decided to conclude my story at &#39;EIGHT&#39;. I wanted to create a Universe akin to the Game of Thrones/Lord of the Rings/Dune/Harry Potter. The world deserves another top-quality Sci-Fiction/Fantasy/Dystopian novel series, after all. Presently, I am working on my THIRD and FOURTH Novel simultaneously, since I&#39;ve already finished writing my SECOND and self-publishing my FIRST.</p> <p>The first novel is available for order on Amazon, The Bookoholics Store and Google Play.

My girlfriend loves me deeply, but I feel like I\u2019m not giving back the same kind of love and commitment she deserves.</p> <p>I\u2019ve made mistakes\u2014constantly cheating and lying to myself that it doesn\u2019t affect her, but deep down, I know it does, probably in ways I can\u2019t even imagine. I don\u2019t want to be this person anymore. I want to change my perspective, my behavior, and learn to love her with the kindness, softness, and respect she deserves.</p> <p>If there are any books that have helped you become more emotionally mature, accountable, or simply a better, more loving partner, I\u2019d really appreciate your recommendations.
