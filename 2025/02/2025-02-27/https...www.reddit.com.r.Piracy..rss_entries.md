<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I recently switched from Brave to Firefox, mainly because Brave removed some features like its built-in VPN. I&#39;ve also read that using uBlock Origin, Violentmonkey, and the GitHub Bypass All Shortlinks Debloated script on Firefox can be a great setup.</p> <p>My main question is: Would Betterfox be a better option than standard Firefox, even when I add these extensions? I&#39;ve noticed that Firefox feels a bit slower and more delayed than Brave when opening pages, and I’m wondering if that’s because standard Firefox runs a lot of background processes that use up RAM and bandwidth.</p> <p>Does Betterfox help with both speed/performance and privacy by cutting down on these background activities? Any thoughts or experiences would be much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sosissis"> /u/sosissis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1izrf0e/is_

In qB they say 0 seeders, 0 peers, and just sit there not even starting a download. As far as I can tell I&#39;m doing the same things I successfully did a couple of months ago.</p> <p>My only guess is that 2 nights ago our internet was down so Spectrum could do some work in the neighborhood.
