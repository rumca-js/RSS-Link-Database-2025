<p>Before the Black Death devastated Siena, the city thrummed with energy, expressed in art and architecture designed to dazzle its audience – and which still astonishes 800 years later</p><p></p><p>If you want to know the moment of a medieval Italian city’s greatest prosperity, look at the year it began work on its cathedral. In Siena, the magic year was 1226, the start of some 85 years of construction of the duomo, a remarkable gothic structure with an intricately complex, creamy pink facade and stripy, black-and-white campanile. “The scale of ambition is difficult to put into words,” says Laura Llewellyn, one of the curators of <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/siena-the-rise-of-painting?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlPu9BhAjEiwA5NDSA3oZ-aaZwHppW-PuEToa9UCFD9yJlnZK9jXXrEXmeQNKSh1OK9qwlhoCILEQAvD_BwE">The Rise of Painting</a>, the National Gallery’s new exhibition of Sienese art. “The extravagance of it: to appreciate it you need to unknow and unlearn later b

<p>My boyhood club is shaped by Franz Beckenbauer’s legacy, and for the last half-century has been run by former players</p><p>I congratulate my club on its anniversary. On Thursday, Bayern Munich will be 125 years old. The club was in my cradle, because my grandfather was and my father is a Bayern fan. When I was young, they told me a lot about the golden 70s with the three European Cup victories. They admired Gerd Müller, Sepp Maier and the other players. They were almost in awe of one of them: Franz Beckenbauer.</p><p>In the beginning, Bayern were one of many clubs. I have a few black-and-white pictures from the founding days in mind; I know the club history. But I can only really talk about it from the Beckenbauer era onwards, and since then Bayern have been something very special.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/27/happy-anniversary-bayern-munich-125-years-and-a-simple-secret-for-success">Continue reading...</a>

Whenever I drove up the driveway to his house on Lake Starnberg near Munich at precisely 10.25 am, the tall and smiling FiDi (as he was affectionately called by friends and colleagues) was already standing at the door. He was waiting for me under the large carved letters DFD above the front door. His bright, mischievous eyes made him appear youthful well into old age. Depending on his state of health, he either resolutely offered me his hand or just his elbow (something he did throughout his life to protect himself from infection).

<p>South of the Amalfi Coast is a rugged wonderland of quiet paths through chestnut woods and vineyards. It’s all perfect for contemplating ancient yarns, spotting wildlife and enjoying local fare</p><p>In the silence of the chestnut woods, rays of sunlight ignite the patches of pink cyclamen and crocus. There are fungi of various kinds dotted around, including one that is a perfect sphere of bright orange pushing its way up out of earth. I sit on a rock and after a while I hear a gentle grunting noise, the sort of contented chunter made by a snorer having a light snooze. It’s not me. A pair of wild boar are approaching, moving through the shadows, noses down, short tails flicking continuously. It’s a mother and baby, so close I can see the dust on their backs. I move my hand towards the camera, but wily Old Ma spots the movement and they take off at a blistering pace, charging downhill, bristling with indignation.</p><p>I continue walking uphill, and after a mile or so stop at a paw

Despite being the only one of Daddy Gordon’s children who is knowledgable about the game, she has been overlooked all her life. Why? Because she is a girl and the rest of them are boys! Cue a cutesy flashback in which a child actor delivers a Sorkinesque monologue about the team’s chances and her recommended player trades while trotting beside her father down a corridor of pow

<p>Over 50 years, she has become one of the most revered writers in Australia. Is she finally going to get worldwide recognition?</p><p>In early January, the Australian author Helen Garner decided to cut back an unruly bush in her garden. Garner lives in a Melbourne suburb in the adjoining house to her daughter, son-in-law, three grandchildren, some chickens and a dog. The family were away at the beach for the holidays and Garner found herself alone, in an off-kilter frame of mind. She’s 82, her beach days are over, but she felt her family’s absence. Her grandchildren were growing up, the youngest now 18. Garner realised she was on the brink of a loneliness not felt since she’d moved to live alongside them 20 years ago, after the end of her third and final marriage, to the author Murray Bail.</p><p>Missing her family, feeling adrift, she went outside with some secateurs and “pruned the shit” out of the bush in such frenzied bursts that the next day, when she looked out of the window,

This real-life drama may be cheesy at times, but it is a life-changing story that very much needs to be told</p><p>Corby, Northamptonshire, 1995: the disused steelworks that were once the heartbeat of the town are to be redeveloped into housing and a theme park. As the land is cleared, a crimson dust that will later be shown to contain cadmium and other highly toxic substances is stirred up; open-topped trucks full of the stuff career past unknowing residents to a&nbsp;messy landfill. And so the scene is set for Toxic Town, a true-story drama about a very British scandal.</p><p>Susan McIntyre’s partner works at the site, while Tracey Taylor is an accountant there who has to sluice thick red sludge off her car every evening when she goes home.

<p>How much is immigration responsible for Spain’s economic growth? Ashifa Kassam reports </p><p>When the Guardian’s European community affairs correspondent, <strong>Ashifa Kassam</strong>, first moved to Spain 14 years ago, the country was still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. “All they talked about was la crisis, la crisis. They couldn’t see a way out. There was just no light at the end of the tunnel.”</p><p>Today, things are very different – businesses are opening up, restaurants are packed, and in Madrid “there’s just a buzz to the city that wasn’t there before”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb/27/has-immigration-turbocharged-spain-economy-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Woody Harrelson and Simu Liu star in a terrifyingly well-constructed adaptation of a documentary about a nightmarish accident</p><p>It does not take much to convince that, as an opening title card for Last Breath states, the job of a saturation diver is one of the most dangerous on earth. The facts, also summarily listed in the survival thriller’s introduction, speak for themselves: thousands of miles of pipeline traverse the ocean, dependent on human divers to maintain them; said divers spend days in pressurized chambers to reach depths of more than 1,000ft (300 meters), in near-freezing darkness. It may as well be outer space, as the fiancee of one diver bluntly but correctly puts it.</p><p>Thankfully, Last Breath, Alex Parkinson’s feature film adaptation of his 2019 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/05/last-breath-review-deep-sea-disaster-documentary-divers?CMP=gu_com">documentary of the same name</a>, lets the divers’ work – a maze of levers, pulleys, gas valv

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Brighton<br></strong>Bob Golding, Simon Cartwright and Damian Williams, who have played the comedy giants before, summon them like spirits to the stage in this tribute</p><p>‘You tell ’em a joke they’ve heard before, and: silence.” So says Eric Morecambe in The Last Laugh on audience resistance to secondhand comedy. But it’s a sentiment contradicted by the show itself, which recycles lots of jokes we’ve heard before in its tribute to three 20th-century comedy giants, and makes us laugh plenty. Writer-director Paul Hendy’s play imagines Morecambe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/04/john-kearns-tommy-cooper-comedy-heroes">Tommy Cooper</a> and Bob Monkhouse sharing a dressing room preshow. There is no plot, there are no narrative surprises, just chat and banter among the threesome about their lives and the nature of comedy. Oh, and jokes. Lots of – usually terrific – jokes.</p><p>It’s as much tribute act as drama, the chief pleasure of which
