If I am to migrate to Zoho email services (or any other providers), but keep my email domain hosting on goDaddy (still long way to expiry as I have just renewed) how can I do it? The problem is, while I can do a one time setup in Zoho with my goDaddy email domain details but, come the anniversary of the email domain name renewal I don&#39;t have access to the goDaddy DNS console as the access is via a link in the GWS admin site. I don&#39;t have a GoDaddy cust id and pin as everything was set up by GWS. Anyone can advise w similar experience?

A corkboard/whiteboard display is not necessary but it would be useful especially it it could be updated in real time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SolidIcecube\"> /u/SolidIcecube </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1izoxb3/scheduled_media_displaycorkboard/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1izoxb3/scheduled_media_displaycorkboard/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But this change broke connection of contacts with other apps. What&#39;s I&#39;m talking about: in android, if you have contacts with same phone number in different apps (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc), they will be linked and shown in address book as single entry. Before it worked for me, but now it has problems. For example, contact synced from CardDAV and Telegram contact are linked properly, but WhatsApp contact with the same number isn&#39;t linked to them and appears as separate entry. On the other hand, there&#39;s some contacts that keep correct link and in some cases there&#39;s bunch of contacts from different messengers that are linked correctly to each other but not to &quot;parental&quot; contact which is synced with cloud.</p> <p>I strongly would like to bring order to my address book so are there any ways to explicitly link different contact",

I&#39;ve added several new features since (including a RISC V port for some unclear reason). I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s more features I want to add. </p> <p>I would benefit from some help with testing! There are bound to be some undiscovered bugs left, and I&#39;d like to fix them. If you have time to lend a hand with that, I&#39;d appreciate it! Of especial interest are bugs with Docker deployment (I don&#39;t know Docker very well), and database backup/migration bugs.</p> <p>New feature requests are welcome too! Although some things I&#39;m not going to include are advertisements, links to buy things, user metrics collection/history, or recommendation engines. Or anything that makes the app consume significantly more memory/CPU. I eventuall",
