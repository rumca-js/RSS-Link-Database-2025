I have a Brother ADS-2800W because it&#39;s a multi page scanner that can scan both sides at once. In Linux, it only scans one side. Checking the scanimage cli options confirms it won&#39;t do duplex scanning. After working on it off and on, I&#39;m thinking this is a driver issue. No matter what scan software I use. Does anyone here have a doc feeder scanner that can scan duplex that works as it should in Linux? What do you have?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AntipodeSeated"> /u/AntipodeSeated </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iznouf/duplex_adf_scanner_in_debian/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iznouf/duplex_adf_scanner_in_debian/">[comments]</a></span>

## Yes, RAM Usage Does Matter

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In recent years, I&#39;ve noticed opposing opinions regarding RAM usage in various DEs and WMs, with the general overall consensus being that the extra RAM use reported in your system monitor app of choice usually doesn&#39;t matter because &quot;unused RAM is wasted RAM&quot;. I was personally indifferent towards that discourse until this past week, which has firmly put me in the camp that strongly believes that more free RAM is good, and using a DE or WM that prioritizes low RAM usage is more beneficial than I used to think.</p> <p>For context, I work from home and typically need to have multiple browsers with inefficient apps like Teams and various poorly coded company portals open throughout the day. My workflow was recently updated to necessitate the occasional use of a minimal Windows 10/11 environment via Virtualbox. I have always had a preference for lighter DEs, so most of my time on Linux has been spent using either Gnome 2 or XFCE. With th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pardon me, I know I should probably have asked this in Qt&#39;s subreddit but this specific Qt topic strictly revolves around the GPL/LGPL and FSP philosophies, hence I thought this would be the best place to ask about it. Also this subreddit is huge.</p> <p><strong>[ Here is what I understand ]:</strong><br/> . I understand the FSF philosophy and freedoms.<br/> . I understand the higher level gist of GPL.<br/> . I understand the higher level gist of LGPL.<br/> . I understand that by using LGPL libraries, I don&#39;t have to provide the source code for the derivative of my work. Either I can statically link such libraries with the object file(s) of my source code and create the final executable/derivative, or I can dynamically link those LGPL compatible libraries to my program and distribute the derivative to my recipients. <strong>But</strong> in both cases, I am bound by the rules of the LGPL to provide a way to link all the LGPL based dependencies

Google Chrome has access to the <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;</code> directory. They can technically steal all our text files from here. This includes all personal projects source code files and other documents.</p> <p>Is there any way to limit the access of Google Chrome to only <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.config/google-chrome/</code> and <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.cache/google-chrome</code> which is its default location to handle temporary data?</p> <p>Or, there is nothing we can do other than just permanently abandoning the Google Chrome forever?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <
