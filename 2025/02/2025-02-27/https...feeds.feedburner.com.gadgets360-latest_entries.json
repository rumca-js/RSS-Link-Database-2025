        "description": "Greenland\u2019s massive ice sheet is losing ice at an accelerating rate, with scientists warning that a global temperature rise of just 2\u00b0C could trigger irreversible collapse. The loss of 230 gigatons of ice per year is the estimated threshold for this tipping point. If melting continues at current rates, sea levels could rise by approximately 7 metres, endangering coastal communities and disrupting global ocean currents. Urgent action on carbon emissions is crucial to slowing or preventing this catastrophe.",
