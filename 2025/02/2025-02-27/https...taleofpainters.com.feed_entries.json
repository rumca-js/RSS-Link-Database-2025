        "description": "<p>Back in 2023 I painted five Assault Intercessors with Jump Packs. It was the third unit for my brand new Blood Angel army, by the time I'd finished them, I thought to myself \"never again!\" They took too long and I didn't enjoy it. Fast forward nearly two years and I've recently finished another five, find out in today's blog what changed my mind and I'll also share how to paint them.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/02/showcase-blood-angels-assault-intercessors-inc-painting-guide/\">Showcase: Blood Angels Assault Intercessors (inc. painting guide)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
