        "description": "<p>I\u2019ve spent the last six days using the iPhone 16e, and the experience has been a throwback. In many ways, the iPhone 16e both looks and feels like the modern-day progeny of the early Steve Jobs era iPhones. Early iPhones like the plastic 3G and 3GS, and the glass-back/metal-sides 4 and 4S were simpler offerings. Two colors, black and white. Single-lens inconspicuous cameras. The iPhone 16e feels like their descendent.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the camera. With just a single lens on the back, the iPhone 16e camera doesn\u2019t just <em>look</em> less conspicuous compared to its dual- and triple-lens brethren, it <em>feels</em> less conspicuous. Especially for me, coming from several years of daily-driving an iPhone Pro model, the 16e feels striking smaller in hand and pocket because it lacks the entire \u201cmesa\u201d protrusion from which iPhone 16 and 16 Pro camera lenses themselves protrude. </p>\n\n<p>Apple\u2019s tech specs for iPhone thickness don\u2019t include the camera lenses or camera mesas.
