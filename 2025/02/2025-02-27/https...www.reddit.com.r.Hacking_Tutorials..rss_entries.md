I&#39;ve tried multiple times to get into this field, but I always run into the difficulty that once I learn a concept or a topic, it branches out into infinite complexities and categories.</p> <p>I&#39;m very interested in malware/ransomware development, but I&#39;ve never found a guide that properly teaches and explains all the fundamentals. Could you recommend one for beginners?</p> <p>I don‚Äôt have any programming knowledge yet‚Äîwhat would you recommend I start with? Ideally, I&#39;d like everything to be free at least to learn the basic structure, and then, if I see that I‚Äôm capable and really interested, I‚Äôd consider investing in a paid course.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AmbitiousSeaweed6007"> /u/AmbitiousSeaweed6007 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comme

I don&#39;t have everything on there backed up, some stuff is stored locally (some documents, passwords etc.). Now this morning I woke up... And the tablet won&#39;t accept my password. </p> <p>I know, most of you will say &quot;you probably forgot it or mistyped it&quot;. Trust me, no. It&#39;s a specific number that has a meaning to me. and as I said, this has happened before, with another person watching me type in the passcode before and OSCAL refusing to accept it 24hrs later.</p> <p>Last time, I did a hard reset, because I didnt have so much data on my tablet yet, and I needed a quick solution. But I&#39;d like to avoid that if possible.</p> <p>Has anyone run into the same problem? Does anyone have an idea for a solution - either re-unlocking th
