Do you recommend switching to Linux because under Windows when i do browsing it takes Like half an second to Print the single Lettern and yes, i did an Clean WIN11 Install. My hole system is lagging Sometimes a bit. So will i have better or Same Performance with that Hardware under Linux or IS IT Not worth IT switching because the Performance loss IS going to be huge? The new Linux Kernel 6.14 will be released in a month and IT will probably give more FPS. So what do you recommend? Staying on ass Windows 11 or switching to Linux. I doesnt want to have less Performance because my Hardware ist that good and i need that Performance For gaming.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Schnurzel21\"> /u/Schnurzel21 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1izfueo/performance_on_linux_with_nvidia/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

From what I understand, software seems kinda important for them since it allows you to configure how the switches function. Is there any general software for HE keyboards available on Linux?

I was thinking about using Fedora with a virtual machine that has a Windows machine, or just using Pop OS for gaming since I can use Gnome with both of them. Are these good ideas?
