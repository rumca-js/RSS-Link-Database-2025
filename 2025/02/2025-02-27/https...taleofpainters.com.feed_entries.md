<p>Back in 2023 I painted five Assault Intercessors with Jump Packs. It was the third unit for my brand new Blood Angel army, by the time I'd finished them, I thought to myself "never again!" They took too long and I didn't enjoy it. Fast forward nearly two years and I've recently finished another five, find out in today's blog what changed my mind and I'll also share how to paint them.</p>
