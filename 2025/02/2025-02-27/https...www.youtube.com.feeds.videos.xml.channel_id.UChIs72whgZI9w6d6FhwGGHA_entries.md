We've been covering NVIDIA's screw-ups all week, and now it's time to talk through some opinions and some facts about AMD's situation. This video is us talking about AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT pricing situation for its impending announcement on Friday, February 28, where it will more fully detail its RX 9070 series GPUs. The video is just us talking through opinions and market conditions as we try to better understand AMD's position right now. NVIDIA's RTX 50 launch was a disaster, with all of its cards -- the RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 Ti (so far) -- each having some sort of problem on its own. Intel has already launched its new architecture. That leaves AMD as the last one to launch this generation's new GPUs.
