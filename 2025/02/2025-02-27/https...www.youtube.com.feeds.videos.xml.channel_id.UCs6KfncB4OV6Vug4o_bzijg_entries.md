Welcome to my Linux distro showdown! I'll rank Linux distributions based on my personal experience and factors like stability, package manager, community support, privacy/security, & customization. We'll explore popular choices like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, openSUSE, Qubes and more! Don't forget to leave a comment with your own favorites! Quick correction: Linux Mint is not *technically* a Ubuntu fork, though it borrows quite a bit from it. It's developed independently though and I should've made this clearer in the video!
