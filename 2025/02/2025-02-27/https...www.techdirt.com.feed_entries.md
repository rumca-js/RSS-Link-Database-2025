It&#8217;s a familiar playbook. When Donald Trump receives backlash from the public or the press for some action he&#8217;s taken, say barring AP News from White House press briefings and events because it won&#8217;t bow to his desire to rename parts of a large body of water, he doesn&#8217;t shrink. He doubles down. Every single [&#8230;]

Look, sometimes you make mistakes. Maybe you send an email to the wrong person. Maybe you accidentally buy the wrong kind of pasta sauce at the grocery store. Maybe you accidentally dismantle critical global health infrastructure. These things happen! At least, that&#8217;s what Elon Musk wants us to believe. At yesterday&#8217;s first official Musk/Trump administration [&#8230;]

Lots of states have been passing performative, rights-violating bills that mandate sites hosting porn start performing age verification or suffer the consequences. The consequences can be severe, with fines being multiplied per access by unverified users on top of legal actions brought by state prosecutors. Most of these follow the same problematic blueprint. Even if [&#8230;]

Look, when Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post a decade ago, people worried that a billionaire owner might interfere with the paper&#8217;s editorial independence. For years, those fears seemed overblown — Bezos appeared content to let journalists do journalism while he focused on more pressing matters (like building rockets and not paying taxes). But it [&#8230;]

It’s understandably not going to get the same attention as the&#160;dismantling of numerous government agencies at the hands of rich unelected manbabies, but the Trump administration is also taking aim at all the promising parts of the 2021 infrastructure bill. Especially as it relates to broadband. The&#160;Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act&#160;(IIJA) contained a whopping $42.5 [&#8230;]

Here&#8217;s another appellate anomaly. Most circuits (including this one!) have concluded destroying someone&#8217;s home and property while engaging in law enforcement activity is just the sort of thing citizens are supposed to abide with good grace in exchange for living in a society.
