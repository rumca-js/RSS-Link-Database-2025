## Do you cover your computer camera? You may not be remembering this one important thing

<p>Ages ago, coworkers asked why I covered my laptop’s webcam. Then they saw a video where a hacker used a remote access trojan (RAT) to spy on two people sleeping. They started taping over their webcam lenses, too.</p>



<p>But that’s actually not enough to keep someone from spying on you. If you want full privacy on a laptop, you need to block your microphone, too.</p>



<p>Malware capable of recording your camera’s feed can just as easily capture your incoming audio, as antivirus maker <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/webcam-stalking/52733/">Kaspersky recently reminded</a> us. (These types of data aren’t the only ones a hacker can steal, but they’re among the creepiest.) Fortunately, you can do this in a few ways, and quickly, too.</p>



<p>An easy method is plugging in a headset (headphones with a built-in or attached mic) with a mute button. On

<p>President Trump said Thursday that he plans to raise the tariff on imported good from China to a new high of 20 percent, potentially raising the prices of imported technology products even higher.</p>



<p>A Trump post on the Truth Social network said that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on goods imported from Canada and Mexico on March 4, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-71761a2894e13a050717afda4fd8131a">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p>



<p>“We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” the Republican president wrote, according to the AP. “China will likewise be charged an additional 10 percent Tariff on that date.”</p>

## IDC lowers 2025 PC forecast due to Trump tariffs

<p>Market researcher IDC has lowered its forecasts for worldwide PC sales for 2025, stating that the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs — higher PC prices — will reduce the average consumer’s desire to actually buy one.</p>



<p>The overall outlook, however, is still positive. In January, IDC <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3732169/more-than-4-pc-shipment-growth-predicted-for-2025-but-not-for-what-you-expect-says-idc.html">said</a> that it expected PC sales to grow 4.3 percent over 2024. Now, global PC volume is expected to increase 3.7 percent over 2024, for a total of 273 million PCs sold. When tablets are factored in, the overall growth lowers to 2.1 percent, for a total of 416.3 million units. Overall consumer device sales, including tablets, is expected to be 236.7 million units, growing just 0.2 percent.</p>

<p>No doubt you use your mouse’s scroll wheel to scroll up and down in browser windows and in programs like Microsoft Word – perhaps without even realizing it. If you’re a gamer, you may even find it to be the quickest way to swap items or weapons.</p>



<p>But if you’re just scrolling on your y-axis, you’re really missing out! Both gaming and general-use mice also come with four-directional scroll wheels now and getting one can really revolutionize your work or play. Here’s why…</p>

<p>When it comes to productivity, setting up the tools you need for an efficient workflow is a no-brainer. Most people will do that with a mouse that has two-directional scrolling, but a mouse with four-directional scrolling, like this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDZCDK2T/?mr_donotredirect=

<p>Some of my colleagues based on the West Coast have recently been commenting on how expensive hotels have become. Sure, they’ve become pricier for everyone, but now, they were saying, it’s getting ridiculous.</p>



<p>At first, I just chalked it up to the post-COVID tourism boom. But then articles started to pop up accusing popular hotel booking sites of a predatory technique called price discrimination. </p>



<p>Residents of the notoriously affluent city San Francisco were being <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/hotel-booking-sites-overcharge-bay-area-travelers-20025145.php">charged higher rates for hotels online</a> than those based in other places. A <a href="https://personalization.ccs.neu.edu/Projects/PriceDiscrimination/">study by researchers at Northeastern University</a> found that users of some sites were unwittingly placed into pri

<p>Never skimp on anything that separates you from the ground. That includes shoes, tires, mattresses, and chairs. When you spend so many waking hours at a desk, a good chair <em>really</em> matters.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to spend too much, though, then you need to strike when a hot deal shows itself — like this <a href="https://www.staples.com/union-scale-flexfit-kroy-ergonomic-mesh-swivel-task-chair-black-un59456/product_2260271">Staples Kroy ergonomic mesh chair for $100</a>. That’s a whopping 61 percent off its original $260 price tag, a rare discount that may not come again for a long time.</p>



<p>The Kroy task chair has many adjustments you can make, ranging from seat height to armrest heights to lumbar support. That last bit is absolutely crucial because, as a short person, I always find the lumbar support hits wrong on office chairs. With thi
