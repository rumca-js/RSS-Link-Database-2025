<p>A senior US official chided the UK government on Tuesday for pressuring Apple to create a backdoor in its encryption — although the US law enforcers would like a backdoor of their own.</p>



<p>US national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard responded to an inquiry from two members of Congress, writing that she is concerned about the UK’s request.</p>



<p>“I share your grave concern about the serious implications of the United Kingdom, or any foreign country, requiring Apple or any company to create a backdoor that would allow access to Americans personal encrypted data,” Gabbard wrote in <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/dni_wyden_biggs_responsepdf.pdf">a letter</a>, a cop

<p>Not so long ago, the definition of an IT worker was pretty simple: they were largely confined to central roles related to hardware, network infrastructure, and software development in centralized IT departments.</p>



<p>But what constitutes an IT worker has evolved in recent years; now, it can just as easily mean technologists embedded in virtually every division of a company with greatly expanded responsibilities and skills.</p>



<p>IT is now a key driver of business strategy, with workers collaborating directly with business leaders on digital transformations, product development, data-driven decision-making, improved customer experiences — even business operations. Cybersecurity is now a
