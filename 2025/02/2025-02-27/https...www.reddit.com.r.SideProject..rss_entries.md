<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I’ve been working on a <strong>next-gen password manager</strong> called <strong>VaultCore</strong>. Unlike most programs, VaultCore is <strong>obfuscated and encrypted.</strong> making it far more advanced, secure, and efficient.</p> <h1>Why VaultCore?</h1> <p>✅ <strong>Fully offline</strong> – No cloud storage, no tracking, 100% local encryption<br/> ✅ <strong>Obfuscated &amp; encrypted into C</strong> – Not your typical program<br/> ✅ <strong>Modern GUI</strong> – Clean and responsive interface<br/> ✅ <strong>High security</strong> – Built with <strong>strong encryption</strong> to keep your passwords safe</p> <p>I made this because I wanted a <strong>truly private</strong> password manager—one that doesn’t rely on the cloud or big corporations. Would love to hear your thoughts!</p> <p>💻 <strong>More info:</strong> <a href="http://vaultcore.online/">vaultcore.online</a><br/> 🔗 <strong>Discord community:</strong> <a href="https://disc

When triggered (via some key combination), it would suggest a mix of actions and context-aware links based on the site. </p> <p>For example, if you’re on your Stripe dashboard, it might suggest popular actions like “Refunds in the last 30 days” or show a text box where you can type an email and get a quick link to “See transactions from {email}.” </p> <p>The options would be a mix of:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Predefined shortcuts</strong> (curated for popular sites at launch)</li> <li><strong>AI-generated suggestions</strong> based on context</li> <l

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I wanted to share my little &quot;adventure&quot; that I had in the past ~2 weeks. Basically, I somehow got tired of second guessing my every idea for a project/business and forced myself to build anything. It was actually really refreshing to get back to building. Coming up with ideas and then destroying them constantly in my head is really draining. I guess (hope?) I am not the only one :P</p> <p>By accident I learned about thing called WebAssembly (basically you can execute pretty complicated programs locally in the browser without sending anything anywhere) so I immediately assumed that it could be used for a set of small, private tools. From the builder side - it is a nice bonus since you don&#39;t have to host backend.</p> <p>So I decided to not think a lot about it and just go for it. Usually I am building with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, hosting it on PythonAnywhere. So this time I decided that I will step out of my comfort zone even furt

## Are you too shy to show your face on social media to promote your business? Here’s the perfect solution!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed how TikTok, Reels, and Shorts have become essential for promoting businesses. But there’s a problem: many entrepreneurs want to use these platforms but don’t like being on camera.</p> <p>That’s where I saw an opportunity. Businesses pay me to record videos promoting their products and services. I don’t need to be an influencer or have followers—just show up on camera and follow a script.</p> <p>Now, I’m building a platform that connects businesses needing content with people willing to record videos for money. Think of it like “Fiverr” but just for short-form video content.</p> <p>Does this sound useful? Would you pay for this, or would you be interested in making money by recording videos? Let me know what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Green-Attention-1469"> /u/Green-Attention-1469 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1iz2mup/are_y
