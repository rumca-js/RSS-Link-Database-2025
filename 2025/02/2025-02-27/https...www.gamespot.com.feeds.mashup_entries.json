A new in-browser macrodata refinement \"game\" lets you refine mysterious numbers just like the characters in the show do, and you, too, have no idea what it's for or why you are doing it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The game can be played in your browser over at <a href=\"https://lumon-industries.com/\">lumon-industries.com</a>, transforming your computer or phone into an official Lumon MDR workstation. Just like in the show, certain groups of numbers will start to stand out, allowing you to drag your mouse cursor over them. This collects the numbers and sorts them into various bins (unlike in the show, the game does this part automatically). It's all extremely simple. Numbers get big. Scary even. Then you just highlight them and profit. Praise Kier!</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UXKlYvLGJY\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%",
