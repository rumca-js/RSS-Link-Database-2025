Directed and written by Shal Ngo, known for his work on "The Park," "The Box," and "The Last Fisherman," "Control Freak" introduces a chilling narrative: "

A motivational speaker is tormented by an unrelenting itch on the back of her head." This intriguing premise leads into a terrifying journey as she battles a parasitic demon from her homeland, bringing a fresh and thrilling perspective to the horror genre.

Directed and written by Shal Ngo, known for his work on "The Park," "The Box," and "The Last Fisherman." Shal Ngo was tapped to write and direct the short film "Control" in 2021 for the second season of Hulu’s Bite Size Halloween.

We're confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package.

There’s a lot that Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you, and even when it does, there are more specifics to be learned or buried in menus. Because there’s so much to get through, we’ve decided to make two videos! One for Low Rank and new Monster Hunter players, and one specifically for High Rank in Wilds further into the game. While a lot of our footage here will be from High Rank hunts, it’s all stuff that’s applicable earlier in the game, and we’re using preorder bonus layered armor so we don’t give away some later game armor designs.

In today's Fix of entertainment news:
John Lithgow may have accidentally let slip that he's joining the cast of the HBO Max Harry Potter reboot, and the trades are making it official. Lithgow will be the new Albus Dumbledore in the live-action series, and will be the oldest one taking the role at 79 years old. In other news, actor Lizzy Caplan revealed some details about the canceled Gambit solo film—it would've been part romantic screwball comedy. Caplan had had meetings with star Channing Tatum about the project, which was ultimately canned when Disney bought X-Men film rights holder 20th Century Fox. And take a peek at the five immersive worlds of the all new Universal Epic Universe at Universal Orlando Resort.

## PS Plus Games for March 2025 Announced - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
Sony has revealed the lineup of new games coming to PlayStation Plus in March. Headlining the list is Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is a fairly new game, having dropped just a few months ago. The fourth Dragon Age game failed to hit EA's sales goals, so putting the game on PS Plus so soon is likely an attempt at recouping some cash. In other news, BioWare's co-founder put Microsoft on blast for some bad advice during the original Xbox era. It was Microsoft's suggestion that cult favorite RPG Jade Empire be released for the OG Xbox right at the end of its life, just a few months shy of the Xbox 360's debut. Dr. Greg Zeschuk is convinced Jade Empire could've been a hit for BioWare if the game was held for newer hardware. And finally, comic book writer Gail Simone has seen the canceled Wonder Woman game, and is singing its praises. Too bad we'll never get to see for ourselves.
