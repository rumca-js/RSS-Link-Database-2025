It uses multiple methods to detect malware, heuristics, detection of api hooking, entropy calculation, yara rules, etc. It also has a built in neural network as well. I wrote this because learning about modern AV is difficult, moreover the resources out there are sparse. So initially this was a learning opportunity for me, but I wanted to share it with others. Obviously this isn&#39;t something to ever use in production lol. <a href=\"https://github.com/dev-null321/Harkonnen/\">https://github.com/dev-null321/Harkonnen/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_W0z\"> /u/_W0z </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1izq0lc/harkonnen_educational_av/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1izq0lc/harkonnen_educational_av/\">[commen",
