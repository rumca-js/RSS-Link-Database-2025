I use the VDXR openxr runtime with Open Composite for pretty much everything I can (Deo VR, Skyrim VR, Elite Dangerous VR, MS 2024). For some reason, even though I use the VD streamer to set the codec to h264+, VD will launch any VR game using hevc. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been able to use h264+ at 500mbps for a whiile now, and I prefer the image quality on my rig so I&#39;d like to continue using it .I&#39;ve verified that other codecs in the streamer (hevc 10, av1 10) work ok, it&#39;s h264+ that&#39;s the problem. I&#39;ve tried reducing the quality setting in VD to High just to make sure it&#39;s not a performance issue, but VD will auto switch to hevc even for non resource hungry games like Deo VR. </p> <p>Is this an issue with my rig or with VD? Should I try uninstalling and reinstalling the streamer? Any ideas/help is greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-",
