We are using Sentinel and I am working on using GitHub repos to manage our detections (and eventually automations). Currently we have 2 Sentinel instances, 1 Dev and 1 Prod. We test all of our detection rules in dev before copying and pasting to prod. This process is super inefficient to do manually. We are also getting sick of the lack of version control and accountability. This GitHub would be managed by me and 2 other engineers.</p> <p>Any suggestions on how you would set up the branches and manage them? I have been researching git strategies, but I haven&#39;t seen much for the specifics of detection-as-code. In my test lab I made a main branch then copied the contents to a dev branch. I currently make modifications in dev and then cherry pick commits I want to the main branch.</p> <p>I am worried cherry picking will eventually cause conflicts. I ",

Companies should be thinking about how to prepare their teams for the evolving threat landscape, especially when it comes to emerging tactics like social engineering and AI driven attacks. It\u2019s also worth considering whether it\u2019s time to take a more integrated approach, where everyone, rather than just IT, understands their role in keeping data safe</p> <p>Also, how do we make training more engaging and realistic so employees remember it in the long term?
