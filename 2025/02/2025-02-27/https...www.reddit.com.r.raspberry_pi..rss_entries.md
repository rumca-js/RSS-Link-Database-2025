<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;m officially done trying this on my own :( Hello there.</p> <p>So I want to use the hardware pwm of the raspberry pi 5 because I&#39;m worried that the software I am going to run might slow down the software pwm which is kinda bad because this could mess up the whole process... I then followed these two tutorials (fist one is based on the second one)</p> <ol> <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/rpi-hardware-pwm/">https://pypi.org/project/rpi-hardware-pwm/</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/jdimpson/syspwm">https://github.com/jdimpson/syspwm</a></li> </ol> <p>Basically you edit the /boot/firmware/config.txt file and you&#39;re good to go. I did that and nothing worked. I tried hooking up a led to GPIO 18 (pwm0) to visualize the hardware pwm but wasn&#39;t able to see anything. Ofc I also tried just lighting up the led to test the circuit. (LED between GPIO 18 and GND with a resistor in between.)</p> <p>I then wanted to see wheth

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. Im currently in the process of building a robot that uses the Raspberry Pi 3B+. The robot needs 2 different voltage loops, that being 5V for the raspberry pi and sensor inputs, and 11.1V for the drive circuitry. For convenience I would like my robot to have a single power source.</p> <p>The drive circuitry consists of 2 motors, a <a href="https://shop.bristolbotbuilders.com/product/dual/">dual output ESC</a> and a 3S LiPo battery. </p> <p>The ESC has a BEC built into it which can supply 5V at 150mA according to BBB. Previously I had a setup that had a different external BEC that I think had a higher current. This is normally designed to power a receiver for a RC controlled robot. If I&#39;m not mistaken the raspberry pi 3B+ requires 5V at 2A.</p> <p>My thinking is I can connect the BEC from the ESC into the GPIO pins and power the raspberry pi there. However I&#39;m worried that either the BEC wont supply enough current, or if it does it

I.e. wifi adaptor is not detected, nor is bluetooth module. Both the things stopped working out of no where. I had just removed the sd card to take the rpi out of the case, then I pit the sd card back, and then poof- goes into ramfs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!<br/> I&#39;m doing a master degree and I have to program a Raspberry Pi Zero to make some data collection in a secluded environment. Everything works fine for the program. I have downclock the setting so it takes low energy. Now it draws only 0.088 A or 88 mA with some spike when the data is taken every 5 minutes. With that comes the problem that the powerbank auto shutoff because the load is too little. At the same time, I want it to be little so the powerbank can run at least a week. I&#39;m unable to use big solar battery like my other setup, it must be compact and lighweight. I&#39;m curious to know if someone has already pull off something like that ?
