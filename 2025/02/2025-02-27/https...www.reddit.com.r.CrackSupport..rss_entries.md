<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sul sul! I’m having some trouble with Anadius. I was able to download a number of expansion packs and run the dlc unlocker, but the issue is that my computer is so low on space I can’t play properly 💀</p> <p>It took hours to download after a failed attempt yesterday at trying to download it directly onto my hardrive (it took about 8 hours to download all the packs and then they were nowhere to be seen 😪). Is there any way to move the Anadius packs and sims game to my hardrive without breaking the game? And also in the process being able to download the remaining packs and extensions?
