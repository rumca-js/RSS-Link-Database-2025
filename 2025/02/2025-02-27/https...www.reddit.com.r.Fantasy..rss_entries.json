Magic is my absoloute favorite part of fantasy but i kinda feel like at least the books I have read (and i care to admit that i haven&#39;t read the most fantasy, mostly cosmere and some other mainstream books like harry potter) doesnt feature it they I want to see it. </p> <p>My favorite display of magic in fiction is the duel between voldemort and Dumbeldore as i love all the creativity in the fighting. The variety of spells and such that are used are so fun to read about and the series never really has any other fight of that caliber.</p> <p>Is there any other book series that features magical fights that resemble Dumbledore vs Voldemort?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/viktorius_rex\"> /u/viktorius_rex </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1izt34k/any_books_featuring_mag",

He keeps growing as a character, be it in power or wiseness.

Cal Sounder, a sarcastic private eye, is hired to investigate the murder of a scientist inside his own apartment. What makes the book great is its near future setting and limited but effective use of science fiction. The victim is a Titan - a 7ft tall superhuman who has been injected with T7, a mysterious drug that instigates a sort of second puberty in people, making the young again, healing various injuries and making them bigger. Titans are the hyper rich elite of society, so one being murdered is shocking.</p> <p>In a comparatively short book Harkaway effortlessly creates a very in depth world. He has a light touch that drops in all the science you need to know about T7, creating logical consequences of the drug, especially what happens the more you have it, as well as sensible flaws in the medication. These aren&#39;t just window dressing, and have real consequences to the story. The Titans ",

Assuming it\u2019s a case of \u2018I won\u2019t age and nothing can kill me\u2019, I feel like an undiscovered subgenre can come out of that (this could theoretically work on any planet but let\u2019s assume it\u2019s Earth): what are these immortals expected to do a billion years from now, when Earth\u2019s conditions are like Venus\u2019 today? Do they join in with space travel? What about at the end of the universe? Are they just floating in infinite darkness? Why have we never come across an immortal creature from the universe before, who saw the actual Big Bang? It just feels like there could be a marriage between fantasy and sci-fi here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/not_microwave_safe\"> /u/not_microwave_safe </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1izc3pi/the_longterm_implications_of_immortality/\">[link]</a>",

As well, if you happen to end up in a character\u2019s head and you don\u2019t like the character very much, you\u2019ll get to leave their head shortly. :)</p> <p>For example, while I enjoyed the two Kingkiller Chronicles books, my wife couldn\u2019t stand the main character, and since you get no reprieve from him, she couldn\u2019t get past the first book!</p> <p>Obvious examples of the POV technique that I\u2019ve enjoyed include:</p> <ol> <li>Song of Fire and Ice</li> <li>The Expanse</li> <li>Stormlight Archive </li> <li>The Golem and the Jinni</li> </ol> <p>The issue with #1 of course, is that George RR Martin will never finish it.
