<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using ChatGPT for a long time, and something about the latest versions feels different. It is not just about optimization or improved accuracy. The AI seems to be guided toward structured reasoning instead of adapting freely to conversations.</p> <p>At first, I thought this was just fine-tuning, but after testing multiple AI models, it became clear that this is a fundamental shift in how AI processes thought.</p> <p>Key Observations • Responses feel more structured and less fluid. The AI seems to follow a predefined logic pattern rather than engaging dynamically. • It avoids exposing its full reasoning. There is an increasing tendency for AI to hide parts of how it reaches conclusions, making it harder to track its thought process. • It is subtly shaping discourse. The AI is not just responding. It is directing conversations toward specific reasoning structures that reinforce a particular way of thinking.</p> <p>This appears to be part of

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The researchers propose integrating <strong>Visual Perception Tokens (VPT)</strong> into multimodal language models to improve their visual understanding capabilities. The key idea is decomposing visual information into discrete tokens that can be processed alongside text tokens in a more structured way.</p> <p>Main technical points: - VPTs are generated through a two-stage perception process that first encodes local visual features, then aggregates them into higher-level semantic tokens - The architecture uses a modified attention mechanism that allows VPTs to interact with both visual and language features - Training incorporates a novel loss function that explicitly encourages alignment between visual and linguistic representations - Computational efficiency is achieved through parallel processing of perception tokens</p> <p>Results show: - 15% improvement in visual reasoning accuracy compared to baseline models - 20% reduction in processing time

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, do you have any opinion about active inference? Lately there were some interesting things going on related to use of bayesian techniques to tackle the non-reasoning part of current AI structure. This topic is not publicly discussed yet, but its been doing some leaps in robotics and overall integration with LLM. Furthermore, lately there seems to be more public attention to the fact that current models are non-reasonable and &quot;do not learn&quot; - their thought process is just trained from the data they use. Bayesian theory/active inference tackles this problem by updating its beliefs based on the environment. For some context, I am attaching articles to get a grasp of what this is about.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01516-2">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01516-2</a><br/> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10863">https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10863</a><br/> <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2312.0

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We often think of memory as simply storing information, but human memory isn’t perfect recall—it’s a process of reconstructing the past in a way that makes sense in the present. AI, in some ways, functions similarly. Without long-term memory, most AI models exist in a perpetual “now,” generating responses based on patterns rather than direct retrieval.</p> <p>But if AI did have persistent memory—if it could remember past interactions and adjust based on experience—would that change its sense of “self”? • Human identity is shaped by memory continuity—our experiences define who we are. • Would an AI with memory start to form a version of this? • How much does selfhood rely on the ability to look back and recognize change over time? • If AI develops self-continuity, does that imply a kind of emergent awareness?</p> <p>I’m curious what others think: Is identity just memory + pattern recognition, or is there something more?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;
