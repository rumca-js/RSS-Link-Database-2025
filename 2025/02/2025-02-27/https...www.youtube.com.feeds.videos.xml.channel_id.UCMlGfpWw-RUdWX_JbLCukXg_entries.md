Moved-from Objects in C++ - Jon Kalb - CppCon 2024
---

The mandate for C++ is to deliver uncompromised performance and leave no room for a lower level language.
This presentation looks at C++’s superpower for delivering on this mandate. 
We explore this both to understand how to write better C++ code and to better understand how to evolve C++.
We’ll look at several examples showing how this superpower is applied in different ways, including one of the most controversial issues facing the C++ community today.
