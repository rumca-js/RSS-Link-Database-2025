<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>So I work with kids and we have the game a little wordy at work. However a lot of the tiles are missing, because well... Children lol. I had already found someone who listed all of the consonants so I managed to check those and make the missing ones myself. But I have no clue how many of each vowel there is originally. Is there anyone with the game who&#39;d be willing to count them for me? That way I can check what I&#39;m missing. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Artichoke2781"> /u/Ok_Artichoke2781 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1izb6xt/vowels_in_a_little_wordy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1izb6xt/vowels_in_a_little_wordy/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I will soon start organizing board games together with a friend. We will do this in a meeting place in our village. We hope to get the target group of 20 to 60 years old and want to fill the evenings with various games, so that people have a bit of choice in which game they want to play on the evening. Now I am looking for tips for the 1st evening. We do not know which people will come. * which games do you recommend for an unknown group of people. We are trying to make a number of tables with about 4 people per table. And therefore also a different game per table. * for how many people Max would you organize such an evening? * if this works out we also want to play themes, dice games, card games, evening Catan, evening party games. Any tips? * any other tips?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Masjke73"> /u/Masjke73 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The only space we have is essentially a coffee table, and not a huge one at that. </p> <p>We can do Jaipur on it, love that game. Patchwork works, if one of us has the board somewhere else; and the distribution of the pieces is a bit tight. Carcassonne works, but it leads to narrower worlds. No problem.</p> <p>Just wondering if there are any other games specifically for small spaces.
