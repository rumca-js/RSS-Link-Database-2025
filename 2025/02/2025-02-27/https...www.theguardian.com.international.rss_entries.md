Perhaps no manager had a chance with the squad Leicester assembled to attempt survival. Graham Potter, previously linked with Leicester, has meanwhile restored order to West Ham. Jarrod Bowen made things happen for both first-half goals, involved in the move for the first from Tomas Soucek, the second an own goal from Jannik Vestergaard the Hammers captain’s zest had enforced.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/27/tomas-soucek-strikes-to-continue-west-hams-revival-and-leicesters-woe">Continue reading...</a>

I have never been an amazing dancer. It has always been painfully awkward. I feel mortified whenever there’s a requirement to dance, even if it’s as silly as when the grownups join in during a kid’s party! I’ve had strangers offer well-intentioned help; people try to teach me to dance while on the dancefloor (clearly they decided I needed help). I’ve had a friend comment that my dancing is “cute” and strangers mock my dancing by mimicking it in front of me.</strong></p><p><strong>When I was in my 20s, I made up for this in the only way I knew how – by drinking a lot and losing all inhibition.

<p>One game does not fix everything but Leah Williamson and Millie Bright were delighted with team’s grit against Spain</p><p>While Wembley was rejoicing at the sight of England putting the ball in Spain’s net, there were two people noticeably not joining in with the celebrations. Sarina Wiegman had reacted to the Lionesses’ goal by making her way urgently down to the touchline for a detailed conversation with her captain, Leah Williamson, clearly relaying some key tactical details.</p><p>Such a sight is not uncommon in top-level sport, but on Wednesday night it felt particularly indicatory of England’s focus, determination and steadfast resolve to win. Their committed performance in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/26/england-spain-womens-nations-league-match-report">the 1-0 Nations League triumph</a> was one of a side fixated on nothing but victory, high levels of work rate, concentration and, perhaps above all, grit.

Why oh why has this happened?</p><p>The miracle of Eurovision is how much it has legitimised itself over the last decade and a half. For years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision">the song contest</a> was the laughing stock of Europe, a toe-curling night on which all the continent’s fifth-rate novelty acts would gather and bing-bam-boom themselves to death while the rest of Europe looked on and jeered.</p><p>But look at it now. By carefully repositioning itself, and by encouraging countries to submit relevant, modish entries, Eurovision has transformed into the party of the year. People love Eurovision – and not ironically, either. At a time of growing international strife – the sort of strife that it was designed to combat – Eurovision represents a moment of unity. It is, in short, in the shape of

But she disagreed. Mother Animal, a personal account of Jukes’ pregnancy and early years of motherhood, details her growing realisation of how contaminated her body, and her baby, have become. And it’s something she thinks all would-be parents should be more aware of. There are chemicals from human industry in breast milk, amniotic fluid and bones, she writes. Toxicologists have found “forever chemicals” in embryos and foetuses at “every stage of pregnancy … in lung tissues, in livers”. It is inescapable.</p><p>Yet it is spoken about far too little. “I find it quite disrespectful to think that mothers wouldn’t be capable of handling [th

<p>A new instalment of the extraordinary and brutal story of the greatest Ottoman sultan reads like a thrilling novel</p><p>The year is 1538 and Suleyman the Magnificent has taken to signing himself “the great lord and conqueror of the whole world”. The Holy Roman Emperor might have something to say about that. Charles V is still in charge over the other side of the Ottoman empire’s European borders, from the Danube to the Baltic. All the same, there is no denying Suleyman’s vast reach. Since coming to the throne 18 years earlier he has invaded Belgrade, Rhodes, much of Hungary, Baghdad and too many Mediterranean ports to mention. He has conquered most of North Africa. True, there have been a few hitches – he failed to capture Vienna in&nbsp;1529 – but still, as he sits on his golden perch in Istanbul, he is pretty much lord of all he surveys.</p><p>In his previous book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2023/mar/13/this-months-best-paperbacks-melvyn-bragg-urs
