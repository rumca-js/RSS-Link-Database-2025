<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A tale as old as time, I&#39;m sure. I&#39;m currently running ~15tb in random drives attached via USB to an old Optiplex (i3 3220) running Windows. Obviously I&#39;d like both more storage and some kind of protection against failure like RAID. I&#39;ve also just begun getting into Plex so I&#39;d ideally be streaming to a TV, single screen at a time. At any rate, I&#39;d like to keep it&#39;s power draw similar if not less. </p> <p>I also remote into the computer to access it. For example, I can plug an Mp3 player or emulation handheld into the Optiplex and transfer files from laptop or tablet. I know I&#39;m likely doing this &quot;the hard way&quot; but I like a desktop that stays put, no matter what device I access it from. </p> <p>I think I&#39;d like to do 4x 12tb drives. Should I replace the drives with a DAS and call it a day? Do the same with an n100 mini PC? Stuff the drives in a full size Opti (i5) I have? Spring for an all-in-one NAS box?

I have 7 WD external drives ranging from 8-22tb that I shucked to store more efficiently and a couple docks to utilize them when needed. I&#39;m trying to consolidate and organize my data and these drives are not only running at literally 1/200th of the speed they used to but they make my computer virtually useless when in operation. I attempted to move 4tb earlier today. The read/write on these usually hovers around 200mbps when in their enclosures and now they&#39;re between 70-105mbps. What&#39;s worse is the transfer got down to 1.85g and slowed to .5-1mbps. I still have the enclosures that I can try and put them all back into. Is it worth doing that or are there better docks or hubs I can get? Right now I&#39;m using both Insignia and Sabrent docks and a cenmate 3 port hub for a Plex server (which seems to be working okay).</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.
