        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nSony has revealed the lineup of new games coming to PlayStation Plus in March. Headlining the list is Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is a fairly new game, having dropped just a few months ago. The fourth Dragon Age game failed to hit EA's sales goals, so putting the game on PS Plus so soon is likely an attempt at recouping some cash. In other news, BioWare's co-founder put Microsoft on blast for some bad advice during the original Xbox era. It was Microsoft's suggestion that cult favorite RPG Jade Empire be released for the OG Xbox right at the end of its life, just a few months shy of the Xbox 360's debut. Dr. Greg Zeschuk is convinced Jade Empire could've been a hit for BioWare if the game was held for newer hardware. And finally, comic book writer Gail Simone has seen the canceled Wonder Woman game, and is singing its praises. Too bad we'll never get to see for ourselves.",
