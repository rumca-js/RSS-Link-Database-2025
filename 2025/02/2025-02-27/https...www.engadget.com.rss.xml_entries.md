We don’t know what kind of roster the game itself will provide, but it integrates with the cloud-storage service <em>Pokémon Home</em>.

<p>On March 3, Mobile World Congress will kick off in Barcelona, Spain. While it’s not the premier show it once was, many noteworthy smartphone makers around the world still attend the conference and frequently launch new devices there. Typically, we hear from companies like Lenovo, Arm, Xiaomi, Dell and more at the conference, as well as standards organizations like the GSMA on developments in areas like 5G or SIM technology. Occasionally, bigger players like Samsung and LG join the fray, too, and who can forget the year the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-03-mwc-2017-showed-us-the-power-of-nostalgia.html">Nokia 3310 brought nostalgic joy to MWC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
