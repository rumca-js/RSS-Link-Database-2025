<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Gave this mod a try and, though it mostly works, I&#39;m running into a bizarre bug - Ashley&#39;s model only fully renders on the left eye. At first, her face didn&#39;t render at all in the right eye, her hair was just empty, if that makes any sense.</p> <p>After changing some settings, basically disabling a lot of stuff, it changed to a state where her head (as in: the stuff under her hair) does render, but it just floats statically in the world. Every few seconds it updates its position, but it never moves, it just flashes from spot to spot. Again, that&#39;s all in the right eye only - the left eye is just fine. It&#39;s also just her head, but not including her hair somehow.</p> <p>No idea what&#39;s happening, if anyone has any idea of what could be causing this, I&#39;d appreciate some help.

So based on that, I cannot recommend it. </p> <p>Right from the menu it was very obvious that Beyond Blue needed a resolution bump as stuff looked a little jagged and soft. It kinda feels like an early Quest 2 game, and certainly doesn’t run at Quest 3 resolution. But QUest game Optimizer to the rescue! The art style however is quite charming, and I can see ocean lovers enjoying the wildlife. But if you go to touch anything, your hand just clips right through it. Which is a shame, because the first thing everyone is going to do, is try to touch a fish or dolp

That said, I had some specific questions, some probably dumber than others.</p> <p>Currently have a Vive Pro 2 with the wireless module. Came from an Index before that, and while the overall user experience is definitely worse, the resolution bump was worth it and had some practical benefits. Honestly, I&#39;ve been pretty surprised to not see it mentioned around here basically at all (pre-Q3, it seemed to be considered best visuals at worst value).</p> <p>Anyway, PCVR is mostly my preference, but my 3080 struggles with the VP2 -- should I expect similar performance with the Q3? </p> <p>How is PCVR vs the native experience? Since things are offloaded to the PC, does that improve things like battery life? Is it simple to switch back and forth between PCVR and native?</p> <p>Is the Q3 room-scale, or is it standing onl
