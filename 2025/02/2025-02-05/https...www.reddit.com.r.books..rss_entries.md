<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have two that I recall: one very simple and the other so involved that it might stretch credulity but I can assure you that, at least from my perspective, it happened.</p> <p>The first was with William Gibson&#39;s &#39;Idoru&#39;. It was the book I brought along to read on a trip and directly after receiving my ticket I sat down in the terminal and cracked the book open to the chapter I was on and began reading. It was a cute coincidence to find that the character I was reading about was also about to go on a flight, but it certainly became a bit more uncanny when Gibson decided to -- for whatever reason -- mention the seat the character would be in for their flight: the exact same one I&#39;d just been designated. I struggle to recall now but I think it may have been 23? 23B? Something like that. If my books weren&#39;t all stored in a box I&#39;d go check just to see how my memory is holding up.</p> <p>The second was while reading Carl Sagan&#39

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>A Well Trained Wife</em> is a memoir about Leving&#39;s experience in the Quiverfull movement, a high control, Christian faith based &quot;birth cult&quot;. Basically, God has dominion over the father, and the father has total dominion over his wife and kids. The goal is to outbirth the non-Christians. It&#39;s called Quiverfull because children are seen as arrows in your quiver, and if you&#39;re going into war, you want your quiver full. They are often referred to as &quot;fundies&quot; (short for Fundamental Christians). Not all fundies are Quiverfull, but all Quiverfull are fundies.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always been kind of fascinated with the fundie lifestyle because on one hand, their ideology are offensive, but on the other hand, there is something kind of attractive about that frugal, off the grid, homesteading life. I&#39;ve spent enough time on the snark boards and blogs to know that life was hell for these women, but reading a first hand acc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently finished the <em>Vinland Saga</em> anime and caught up with the manga today. The impact this story has had on me is profound—it has changed the way I see myself and pushes me to be kinder, more understanding, and more patient with myself.</p> <p>Without going into too much detail, I’ve faced the consequences of many mistakes I’ve made over the past couple of years. I’m on a path to better myself, but the journey is daunting, and I falter more often than I’d like to admit. Reading not only helps me escape from reality, but beautiful stories like <em>Vinland Saga</em> give me the drive I need to keep pushing forward, to keep improving myself one day at a time. The arc after Askeladd’s death, in particular, resonates with me deeply. </p> <p>I would be truly grateful if you could recommend some of your favorite works that are similar so I can keep motivating myself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.

It&#39;s so well written, lots of great turns of phrases, the writing quality is clearly above today&#39;s standards. Steinbeck has, in this book, and I can&#39;t seem to describe it, a way with words that writers today just don&#39;t have. The humor is subtle, the writing is direct, and it&#39;s descriptive in an almost poetic but not ostentatious way. </p> <p>It was interesting to me to see the similarities and differences in things today compared to when it was written back in the 60s, and also interesting to see that less than 80 years ago cross country travel was novel, and mobile homes, trailers tha
