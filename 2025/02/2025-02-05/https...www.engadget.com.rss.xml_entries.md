<p>Google is changing its tune around efforts to hire employees from historically underrepresented backgrounds, according to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-kills-diversity-hiring-targets-04433d7c" data-original-link="https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-kills-diversity-hiring-targets-04433d7c">a new report from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>The company reportedly announced that it would "no longer set hiring targets to improve representation in its workforce." The first hint that things might be changing at Google was a tweak to its parent company Alphabet's annual report. A phrase that claimed Alphabet was "committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve" featured in previous years was removed.</p>

<p>Reddit briefly banned dozens of subreddits without warning on Wednesday due to a “bug” that affected scores of NSFW communities on the site. Redditors were told the subreddits were banned for being “unmoderated” even though many were heavily moderated, according to numerous posts from confused moderators.&nbsp;</p>

The vast majority of these have now been restored after going offline for a few hours Wednesday morning.

<p>&quot;We cannot confirm with certainty whether the infection was a result of a supply chain attack or deliberate action by the developers,&quot; the pair wrote. &quot;Some of the apps, such as food delivery services, appeared to be legitimate, whereas others apparently had been built to lure victims.&quot;</p>

<p>The event invitation that Amazon sent to the media doesn&#39;t give much away. It includes the date, the Amazon smile/arrow logo and a tagline that reads &quot;See what&#39;s next.&quot; Some swoopy blue lines are in the background.</p>

<p>With <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/topic/super-bowl/">Super Bowl LIX</a> only a few days away, it's a decent time to grab a new TV at a discount.

Nevertheless, we've searched through Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers to find a few Super Bowl 2025 TV deals that might actually be worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be candid, many of the deals we've found are the result of TVs naturally falling in price this time of year more than any Super Bowl-specific sales. Most TVs tend to follow a similar pricing timeline: arrive in the spring, drop a bit over the summer, receive a larger price cut around the holidays, then gradually become cheaper until being
