<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>That game was like a fever dream.</p> <p>Spoilers below:</p> <p>It just popped into my head just now. I would play it in between bouts of Tekken 5. You were like some kinda soldier when your team mates start turning into alien monsters for a reason I can&#39;t remember, and there are these intelligent alien soldiers with advanced space aged weaponry, and actual telepathic grey little aliens. I remember that game took me like 2 years to beat because it was so hard. I kept leaving it but something kept bringing my back. The ending was shockingly sobering. </p> <p>Edit: for clarification I&#39;m talking about the 2005 PS2/XBox game. Not the 1995 light gun arcade shooter that was ported onto the PS1 in 1996. But you&#39;re more than welcome to share your thoughts and memories about either. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spyrothedragon9972"> /u/Spyrothedragon9972 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://ww
