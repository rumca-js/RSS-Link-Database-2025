For the past 2 years I have been working in cybersecurity consulting role, where I advise customers on how to best configure the security products we offer.

I very much lack the strictly technical stuff (which is the minority of my work right now) that I&#39;ve grown upon. I&#39;d like to pursue some more technical junior roles in cybersecurity, whether blue or red team, but don&#39;t really know how I can leverage this job experience I have right now to land a new job. I have worked with a lot of technical stuff as part of my hobbies (mostly programming in plenty languages while working on personal projects, though I&#39;m not really happy with them enough to brag about them in my CV or things like CTFs).
