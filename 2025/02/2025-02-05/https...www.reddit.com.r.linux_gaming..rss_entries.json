I am a linux mint user, and I&#39;m new to linux gaming overall, and I&#39;m having critical performance issues when playing a game.</p> <p>My setup is a dell laptop, 11th i5-1135G7, 16gb ram with an intel iris xe gpu. It is pretty strong, and I was able to freely play gta V with 60fps with low/medium settings when I was using windows.</p> <p>On linux though, not a single game can run freely without droping to 10fps. I have tried valheim (running natively without proton, since it has support), the hunter classic (using different proton versions), and divinity original sin 2 (also with proton). All these games can run on my setup and are supposed to work by looking at protondb, but in my case, I am having huge performance issues, even in low settings.</p> <p>Any idea why this is happening?

While it works fine for basic web browsing, I do still prefer to play my games on linux as opposed to within my windows kvm. It&#39;s really only there for me to play fortnite with my friends (and because i wanted to try it out lol).</p> <p>Anyways it looks like the drivers are replaced with the pcie stubs so i assume you couldnt just use nvidia prime or something to reenable the gpu for linux.

When I&#39;m in certain situations (capital cities or big combat situations) I get some frame jitter. Almost like the screen gets &#39;stuck&#39; on a frame for .1 second, but the in game frame rate still shows 90+ FPS. After messing with almost every setting, I&#39;ve noticed if I cap the frame rate at 60FPS or any number where the frame rate will not fall below it, the problem does not happen. For context I have 165Hz display (also set to 165 in system settings) and in open world / most of the time the rate is sitting right at 165FPS, but when it does fall to like 70-120FPS range it starts to get the jitters.</p> <p>Other possibly relevant information: Nvidia 3080TI (550 driver), Wayland, connected through display port (Tried HDMI, but did not help). Vsync is enabled, but enabled/disabled does not seam to make a diff",
