I picked up an Atari 7800 when I was about 14 and I love the thing. I also have an old TI-99/4A and a Sega Genesis that I picked up a bit more recently. I&#39;m thinking about picking up something from either the 4th or 5th gens as those are probably the eras I&#39;m least familiar with. It&#39;s probably helpful to note that I tend to like weird or more obscure consoles as opposed to the more popular or mainstream ones. I&#39;m currently thinking about trying to pick up one of the many TurboGrafx-16 variants, the Sega Saturn, or the Dreamcast. I thought about the Jaguar because of my aforementioned Atari 7800. But it is stupidly expensive and not worth it for the 3 or 4 games that I&#39;d want to play on it besides it not being well-liked by anyone. I know the Dreamcast is technically a 6th gen console but I&#39",

That&#39;s because these kinds of controllers are relatively simple to build and inexpensive to produce. Once you start getting into the realms of analogue sticks, though, it becomes far more complicated and far more expensive. If these consoles came packaged with at least 2 controllers, they would double the price of the product easily, and adding in more would just be unreasonable. It&#39;s not worth it for these companies to spend the time and resources making these controllers. And that",
