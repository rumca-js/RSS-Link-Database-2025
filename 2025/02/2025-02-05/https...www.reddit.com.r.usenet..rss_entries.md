<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was availing myself to some content, and multiple providers failed to acquire a couple of &quot;files&quot; with the word Christmas in the filename. Thought it odd but moved on. Then on another season of files the same thing happened. Is there something weird about files named Christmas? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/craigers521"> /u/craigers521 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ii5r5g/trouble_with_files_related_to_christmas/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ii5r5g/trouble_with_files_related_to_christmas/">[comments]</a></span>
