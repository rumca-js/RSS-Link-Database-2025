Some time ago, I dont know exactly when I saw a game somewhere on Kickstarter or Gamefound that was a 2 player game where one player played as a Wizard and other as a Warewolf. The neat part is that both players controlled the same figure which would transform between night and day. I don&#39;t know exactly how it played and what were the mechanics but I think Wizard was trying to cure or help the Village and the Warewolf tried to eat people and you should end your turn in the least adventageous position for your opponent since he will control the same figure on his turn. Does anyone know this game and what was it called? Help is much appreciated, thank you in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zion661\"> /u/zion661 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ii8otu/please_help_me_find_this_game/\">[link]</a></spa",

The series is pretty fun, and I love how they highlight the top upcoming board games. But there are a few things about their ratings system that I just don\u2019t quite get.</p> <ul> <li>They mention that their rankings are based on <strong>sales, crowdfunding traffic, and news</strong>. But isn\u2019t sales usually something that\u2019s kept private unless you run a board game store? How can they access that data?</li> <li>And then there&#39;s the <strong>&#39;Month\u2019s Momentum&#39;</strong> score, where they give numbers like <strong>64.2</strong> and <strong>148.4</strong> for the top spots. What does that even mean? It sounds like a strange scale, and I can&#39;t quite figure out the logic behind it. Anyone else have any insight?</li> </ul> <p>Would love ",
