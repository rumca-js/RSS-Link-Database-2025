Chris Smither tells a story about how a custom guitar that one person rejected became a guitar he’s embraced.

Here’s what Smither had to say: 

This guitar. This is a Collings ... let's see ...  OOO2H and I got this about, I think, in 1999 at the Music Emporium in Lexington, Massachusetts, from Joe Caruso, and it was a custom build, but not for me. It was built for a guy that everybody... nobody liked! But he was insistent he wanted ... he wanted the Collings. He wanted one, a 12-fret, not 14 to the body, 12 fret; cut away; short scale; speed head, not a slotted head, and most of the 12 frets usually have the slotted heads like a classical guitar. And so Joe Caruso said, "We'll see what we can do."

And he called up Bill Collings. Bill says, "I don't want to do it!" He says, "I gotta reprogram my cutter and all this, you know, the neck and..." yada yada. 

"Oh, please, please!" 

"Yeah, OK, we'll do it." 

So make a long story
