<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been exploring Maltego for OSINT and wanted to hear from others who’ve used it. How effective do you find it for mapping connections and uncovering relationships? Do you use the free version, or is the paid version worth it?</p> <p>Also, how does it compare to other OSINT tools for network visualization? Any must-know tips, integrations, or limitations to keep in mind?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve held my CISSP for over 12 years. Attending trainings and conferences the past few years with four children under the age of 10 have been challenging. Last year was especially tough with work/family schedules to accumulate CPEs. I asked ISC2 to give me an extension until end of February and they were fine with that, I am 80 CPEs short.</p> <p>I am in management and have hired many InfoSec professionals in the past couple of years and to be honest not having a CISSP hasn&#39;t disqualified anyone from me or other hiring managers in the InfoSec org. We are a multi billion dollar organization and have close to 10,000 employees and are in the SaaS business.</p> <p>My question is: Is it worth me slaving over a computer the next 3 weeks to accumulate 80 CPEs or should I let it lapse? It was nice and shiny about a decade ago but as time passes I have noticed as an employee and as a hiring manager that I pay less and less attention to these certifica

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone</p> <p>I manage two VPNs: • An IPSec VPN between 2 stormshield firewalls. • An OpenVPN server with site-to-site clients.</p> <p>I want to analyze the encrypted traffic in both tunnels to detect potential internal or external attacks. My goal is to monitor activity between my servers and clients to identify suspicious behavior (network scanning, data exfiltration, client compromise, etc.).</p> <p>What I’ve Set Up So Far: • OpenVPN and IPSec configured with detailed logs. • Wireshark for packet analysis (but I can’t see the content since everything is encrypted).</p> <p>My Questions: • What types of internal and external attacks should I be concerned about in OpenVPN and IPSec tunnels? • Are there common attack patterns specific to these VPN technologies? • How can an attacker exploit VPN traffic if they gain access to one of the endpoints? • Is it possible to decrypt OpenVPN and IPSec traffic captured with tcpdump/Wireshark or other too
