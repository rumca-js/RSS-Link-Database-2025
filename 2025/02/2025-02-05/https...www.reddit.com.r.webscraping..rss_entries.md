<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>My cofounder and I have been developing a tool that scrapes law firm directories and then tracks any movement to and from the directory in order to follow the movements of lawyers.</p> <p>The idea is to then sell this data (lawyers name, contact number on directory, email address, and position) to a specific industry that would find this kind of data valuable.</p> <p>Is this legal to do? Are there any parameters here, and is there anything that we need to be careful of?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/3leavclova"> /u/3leavclova </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iigp3b/scraping_law_firms_legality/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iigp3b/scraping_law_firms_legality/">[comments]</a></span>

A friend of mine asked me to try and help him with scraping some images off a website that is protected by what I assume to be sessions keys/cookies from a website called Pixiv Fanbox. </p> <p>The website is <a href="https://hagureoekaki.wp.xdomain.jp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/87fe9d15a214195683094fceae79df1d.png">https://hagureoekaki.wp.xdomain.jp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/87fe9d15a214195683094fceae79df1d.png</a> (however what I provided is one of the many images on this website)</p> <p>I assume the website grabs your cookie/session ID from the creator&#39;s pixiv fanbox, matches it, then allows you to see the image. HOWEVER, I was able to pull these images before with </p> <p>curl -o image.png <a href="https://hagureoekaki.wp.xdomain.jp/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/87fe9d15a21

Basically, I go to this website (<a href="https://www.languagecourse(dot)net/schools--ireland/junior">https://www.languagecourse(dot)net/schools--ireland/junior</a>) and search for school names on Google to find their URLs. I then visit the URLs to locate their email(s). I compile all this information into an Excel list with the school name, website, and email.</p> <p>Is it possible to automate or simplify this process with web scraping and AI?
