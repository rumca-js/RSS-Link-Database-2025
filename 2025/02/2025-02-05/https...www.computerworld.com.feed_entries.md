<p>They say great art reflects its time. When it comes to Apple’s business, just as the iMac and iPod matched the zeitgeist, the company must now develop its business to meet the complex demands of a divided, post-globalist world struggling with economic and climate insecurity. Apple should bear that in mind as it faces its latest regulatory nightmare, this time in China, where its practices concerning in-app purchases and external payment services <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/china-weighs-investigating-apple-over-app-store-policies-fees-including-30-cut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">face fresh scrutiny</a>.</p>

<p>The company that once opened its code of conduct with the words “Don’t be evil” is now opening the door to assisting in the creation of AI-powered weapons and surveillance systems.</p>



<p>Changes in the company’s statement of AI principles introduced in a blog post on Tuesday remove the company’s earlier prohibition on engaging in such activities, leaving it much more wiggle room in an ethical area that has often brought it into <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/405895/google-employees-at-loggerheads-with-company-over-defense-contract-again.html">conflict with its own staff</a>.</p>

<p>Hey, remember the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3629732/almost-a-year-since-launch-apples-vision-pro-still-searching-for-a-killer-app.html">Apple Vision Pro</a>? For a while there, everyone was talking about <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-vision/apple-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s $3,499 headset</a> being the future of productivity. You’d strap a headset to your face and work on large monitors floating in a “mixed reality” world.</p>



<p>Well, that vision has now officially arrived on Windows PCs, and it’s <em>more than 10 times cheaper</em>. For a mere $299, you can pair a Meta quest headset with a Windows 11 PC and work in a mixed-re
