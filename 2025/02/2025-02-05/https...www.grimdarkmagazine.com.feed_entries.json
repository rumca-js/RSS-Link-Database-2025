        "description": "<p>The historical fantasy novel The Morrigan is the adult debut of author Kim Curran. It tells the story of Ireland\u2019s mythological goddess of war, the Morrigan, from her youth as a shapeshifting girl of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann to the wrathful goddess she will become and every form of her legend in between. I am woefully ignorant of Irish mythology, and much of what I know about it has come from other fantasy series, particularly Shauna Lawless\u2019 Gael Song Saga. Still, The Morrigan hooked me and held me in its claws from Curran\u2019s prologue. From her arrival on the shores of ancient Ireland, our protagonist is considered strange. She doesn\u2019t fit in with her people. She is powerful but cannot heal; her magic causes harm. She longs for bloody battles, for death and destruction. She is used as a weapon in the wars of her people and otherwise largely ignored. She stands alone, apart from them, and apart from the humans who later settle on the same green shores. Until they, too, need her battle ",
