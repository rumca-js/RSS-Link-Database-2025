## The President’s Transgender Sports Ban Is an Unconstitutional Power Grab - and It Won’t Hold Up

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The president has just signed an executive order banning transgender girls and women from participating in sporting events. This is not only a legally indefensible action but also a profound moral and ethical failure. It disregards constitutional principles, ignores established civil rights protections, and sets a chilling precedent for executive overreach.</p> <p>First and foremost, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally override federal civil rights laws through executive order. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded educational institutions. Over time, courts and agencies responsible for enforcing this law have recognized that its protections extend to transgender individuals. The Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County reinforced this principle by holding that discrimination against transgender people is inherently a form of sex discrimination.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was raised in the Deep South, in Tennessee. Southern Baptist republicans as far as thee eye can see. Somehow, I’m the only one in the family who turned out differently. I can’t even blame it on me being gay, because my youngest sister is also a lesbian and HUGE MAGA supporter. I do very well going toe to toe with them most of the time. However, yesterday I had to restrain from absolutely losing it on a family member. Post said, “All humans deserve rights.” Family members comment, “Yes but they’re going about it the wrong way as usual.” </p> <p>EXCUSE ME?! Other than being born in a free nation like every heterosexual person, what else do we need to do to earn basic rights? Was there a secret meeting we missed or something?! We deserve the same rights at birth! We are human..we are people. I swear, I can’t fathom how they think the way they do and call themselves Christian. My family just never fails to shock. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm

She did a project on trans representation. </p> <p>Now I was actually really shocked and scared to be in that huge newspaper (600k followers on IG &amp; the article is front cover on the printed version). I have always been very outspoken about queer rights and I make music about these topics, but with everything in USA I am scared. Idk if I want to be extra visible or hide. I only know
