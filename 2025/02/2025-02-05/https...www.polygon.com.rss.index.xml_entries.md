<p class="has-text-align-none">Late last year I caught a post by solo developer <a href="https://x.com/Wabbaboy/status/1862122872631591276">Wabbaboy</a> about how they “got quirky with the tutorial messages” in their upcoming game about a fly with a sword. It wasn’t just the tutorial messages that intrigued me, though. It was, well, <em>everything</em> about <em>FlyKnight</em>, a dreamy retro Soulslike about fighting bugs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>FlyKnight</em>, which was released on Steam last week,<em> </em>is a mix of RPGs I’m not quite old enough to appreciate and Soulslike elements ripped right out of one of my favorite games of all time, <em>Dark Souls</em>. It has the leth

<p class="has-text-align-none">Turns out, if you make a straightforward, more powerful update to the second-best-selling console of all time, and put a 2 on the end of its name, big publishers are happy to jump on board. Without making any specific commitments, Electronic Arts just as good as confirmed that it will be bringing some of its biggest games to Nintendo’s next console.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a recent financial call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about the publisher’s plans for the Switch 2. He replied that he thought EA’s major sports franchises like FC and Madden, as well as The Sims, could find “real energy” on the next Nintendo system.</p>
