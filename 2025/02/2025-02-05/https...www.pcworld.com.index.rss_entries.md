<p>PC gaming via the Microsoft Store can be a pain: game updates can lag, and mod support may be limited. But Microsoft is testing at least one small improvement: modular downloads of games via the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>The new update, being tested for now in the Canary Channel, appears in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/05/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27788-canary-channel/">Windows Insider Build 27888</a>, which launched today alongside support for the MIDI 2.0 specification.</p>



<p>Some games, like the recent <em>Call of Duty</em> games, ship with multiple game modes: a campaign, multiplayer, and so on. And with game developers trying to support both cutting-edge and older systems, there may also be texture packs that provide the highest quality for the newest hardware.

<p>For many, MIDI means SoundBlaster cards, chiptunes, and WAD files played to the sound of a killer synth score. But Microsoft Windows has begun previewing MIDI 2.0, the first update to the MIDI protocol since 1983.</p>



<p>Microsoft is building an in-box public preview of Windows MIDI Services into Build 27788 of the Windows 11 Canary Channel, an experimental build that doesn’t guarantee that it will ever be released to the public. But it undoubtedly will, with the work that Microsoft has already put into this. </p>



<p>Windows MIDI Services includes the updated MIDI stack, not only including MIDI 2.0 but also an update to MIDI 1.0 that allows it to run on Arm64 as well as Windows. MIDI is a way to record and play back music, and as Microsoft notes, forms the foundation of syncing drum machines and synthesizers.</p>

<p>VPNs, or virtual private networks, are one of the most effective ways to stay safe online. Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not be an option. That’s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with much needed security for no cost at all.</p>



<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopen

<p>2025 might just be the year of the OLED monitor, among many other things. I wouldn’t call any of these vibrant upgrades “affordable” yet, but they’re certainly a lot less expensive than they used to be. Take this 34-inch Asus ultrawide OLED gaming monitor, for example, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Ultrawide-Curved-Monitor-PG34WCDM/dp/B0CTS32KZH/">now $749.99 on Amazon</a>, a solid $150 off its list price. <br><br>For that amount, the Asus ROG Swift PG34WCDM offers a screen in the semi-standard 3440×1440 ultrawide format with a sweet OLED panel for amazing colors and perfect contrast. In terms of gaming prowess, it has a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.03-millisecond response time, fast enough for all but the twitchiest of esports competitors.</p>

<p>How the heck did Sonos get here? I’m still in a state of slack-jawed shock considering how Sonos torched its once-sterling reputation with last year’s epic app fail. I’m even more surprised by what Sonos is supposedly teeing up as a Hail Mary. </p>



<p>The idea of Sonos jumping into video streaming isn’t a new one; as early as 2022, the company was <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/625042/is-sonos-looking-to-jump-into-the-streaming-video-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">busy on LinkedIn, recruiting experienced video staffers</a> to help with a “home theater project.” Then last September, we learned that <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/sonos-the-trade-desk-tv-streamer-os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonos had joined forces with (uh oh) a digital advertising firm</a> to firm up a TV OS for the device.

<p>As a mechanical keyboard nut, I’m really picky about the ones I recommend. It’s literally my job. And since it launched last year, my number one pick for gaming keyboards has been Corsair’s K65 Plus Wireless. Normally in the $150 range, right now you can get a refurbished one from Corsair’s website <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/revival-series/ch-91d401l-na-rv/k65-plus-wireless-75-rgb-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-revival-series-ch-91d401l-na-rv">for just $79.99</a>. It’s a fantastic deal.</p>



<p>The K65 Plus Wireless is Corsair’s take on the 75% enthusiast form factor, which blends gaming capabilities with mechanical customization. Highlights include triple-device wireless, high-quality PBT keycaps and smooth switches, hot-swap switch sockets that are compatible with any standard Cherry-style switches, and layers of interior padding for solid so

<p>If you value your sanity, don’t try to buy a new graphics card on eBay right now. I had to take a peek at it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2596318/new-rtx-5090s-could-take-3-to-16-weeks-to-arrive.html">on Monday</a> and it’s, to use the technical parlance of my profession, a shitshow. In addition to the usual scalpers trying to make a small fortune off of already expensive GPUs, a new scam tactic has appeared for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">red-hot Nvidia RTX 5090 and 5080 cards</a>.</p>



<p>It goes like this, according to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/fake-rtx-5090-listings-anti-bot-scams/">Alex Blake of Digital Trends</a>. The listing shows a new card at retail price or just above. For the sake of the RTX 5090/5080, and on eBay specifically

<p>PC gamers are getting pretty darn antsy for new desktop GPUs. Nvidia’s newest cards <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">sold out pretty much instantly worldwide</a> despite astronomical prices, and AMD failing to show off its new Radeon designs at CES 2025 last month was seen as a snub. But it looks like we won’t have to wait much longer for the RX 9070 and 9070 XT — because they’re hitting shelves “in early March,” according to the CEO.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568373/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-rdna-4-embrace-the-ai-revolution.html">initial announcement</a> had the next-gen Radeon cards landing in “Q1,” which would set the end of March as a deadline.

<p>This laptop packs an Intel Core i7-13620H CPU, a decent 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a speedy 512GB SSD. That’s a good enough configuration to handle everyday tasks like a pro, able to boot up and launch apps quickly, multitask numerous browser tabs, and store all the data you need. It’s pretty darn good for day-to-day productivity.</p>

<p>For high-performance TVs and monitors, there are two main cable types that you need to know about: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/457147/hdmi-vs-displayport-which-display-interface-reigns-supreme.html">HDMI and DisplayPort</a>. (What about USB-C and Thunderbolt cables? They both implement DisplayPort, so ultimately it all comes back to that and HDMI.)</p>



<p>Generally, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/706969/laptop-ports-symbols-explained.html">HDMI is used with TVs and laptops</a> while DisplayPort is used with PCs and gaming monitors.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="windows-10-is-not-immediately-insecure-or-no-longer-usable">Windows 10 is not immediately insecure or no longer usable</h2>



<p>First of all, there is no need to panic about this date. Windows 10 will theoretically continue to run indefinitely, as Microsoft is not discontinuing the functionality of the operating system, there will “only” be no more updates from November. This means that you can continue to use Windows 10 in principle, but no more security gaps will be closed, for example.</p>
