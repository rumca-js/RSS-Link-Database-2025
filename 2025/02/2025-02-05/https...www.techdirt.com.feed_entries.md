It&#8217;s 2025 and we&#8217;re still stuck with legislators who wish it was still 1725. Or possibly any year with B.C appended. Clearly unconstitutional laws are being crafted with alarming frequency these days. Those that aren&#8217;t trying to legislate morality or criminalize sexual preferences are trying to infuse government entities with state-approved religion. A lot of [&#8230;]

Back in 2022, former New York Times reporter Ben Smith and friends launched a new media company named&#160;Semafor&#160;on the back of&#160;$25 million in donations. You might recall that one of the organization’s launch events didn’t go particularly well: a “trust in news” event that somehow didn’t see the problem with platforming and amplifying&#160;millionaire propagandist Tucker [&#8230;]

It seems reasonable to call it one of the most dangerous [&#8230;]

There are twenty-four hours in a day. This isn&#8217;t a matter of political opinion or technological disruption—it&#8217;s as immutable as the fact that two plus two equals four. No amount of genius, innovation, or reality distortion can create a twenty-fifth hour. This basic truth, so obvious it seems almost foolish to state, exposes something profound [&#8230;]
