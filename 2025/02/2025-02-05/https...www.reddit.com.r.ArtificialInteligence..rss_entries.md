I think it could replace us because if we kept making it better and better at one point it would become better than humans at analyzing data. Which means it could react better and find the most appropriate solution in any situation: surgeries, driving, teaching, giving therapy. Upload this AI into some very advanced robot and you can have a robot that will give you a surgery. Of course this level of improvement is very far from us, but in the future, if everything goes ok and we want it...</p> <p>People say someone would have to operate those machines so AI can&#39;t replace us but I think it would be a very tiny minority of people needed to watch them.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>im a developer working for an mnc, and i can tell you AI isn’t going to do jack shit to my job. The reason why is, every company has their own unique business logic for each and every product and microservice. There is no ai capable of understanding the end to end functionality of a feature or a business process for every company. Every company would have to spend significant time and money to develop a tool that understands everything, and guess who will have to develop it? Humans, and even if a company manages to do it, all it takes is one production issue and i bet my house the ai won’t be able to figure it out. Fine, lets assume a company builds this also properly, STILL, its only specific to that one company, others will have completely different set of use cases and requirements. Its much easier to hire people develop and maintain code. Only really rich companies can even think about developing a tool that advanced, the smaller ones cannot.</p>

What I am afraid of is the same thing that all of us should fear, ignorance. You will no longer be able to trust your computer. You thought the level of misinformation was bad now? This is going to alter everything you know about reality. It’s time to put the phones down and start shaking hands again. It’s time to get to know your neighbors. Go make friends with every employee at every place that you go to because the next phase, ladies and gentlemen, is not

When I upload an original paper I am working on to the AI, does the AI share the discussions, ideas, data, references, and inferences in that text with other users, either directly or indirectly?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>profile deepseek-r1:1.5b Today at 11:39 Thought for a few seconds Okay, so I&#39;m trying to figure out if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is bad. At first glance, it seems like a big question because political parties are all about making decisions for people&#39;s better interests. But then again, I remember hearing that some people might see it as a political tool or maybe even problematic because of their policies and actions.</p> <p>Let me think about what the CCP does. From what I know, they&#39;re the ruling party in China, which means they&#39;re shaping the country&#39;s direction. They probably care about things like economic growth, improving the living standards of the people, and respecting national unity. But sometimes, I&#39;ve heard that some members or groups within the CCP might take some actions that could be seen as negative by others.</p> <p>I wonder if these views are mainly personal or societal.
