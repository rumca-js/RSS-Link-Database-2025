My tips and recommendations for collecting Tolkien books on a budget!

UK Editions at Blackwells: https://www.blackwells.co.uk?a_aid=nerdoftherings
(If you're looking for the UK editions of Tolkien books, I recommend Blackwells.  They do a much better job of packing their books than AmazonUK so they don't arrive damaged.)
