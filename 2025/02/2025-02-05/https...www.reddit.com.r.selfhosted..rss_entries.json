Think Pytest for LLMs, and the reception was amazing. Big thank you to the community and everyone who contributed to its improvement over time.</p> <p>DeepEval provides evaluation metrics for LLM applications. For example, if you want to assess the answer relevancy of your LLM\u2019s responses, you can create a set of unit tests and use our <code>AnswerRelevancyMetric</code> to run evaluations.</p> <p>However, we encountered a major challenge: some of our metrics depended on Hugging Face&#39;s <code>transformers</code> library, which is exceptionally large. This made it difficult for users to self-host DeepEval on server-less platforms like AWS Lambda, which have strict memory and storage limits. Developers who wanted a lightweight package had to fork our repo",
