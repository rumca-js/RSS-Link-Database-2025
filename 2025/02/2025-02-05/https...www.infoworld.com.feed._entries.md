<p>A malicious typosquat package has been found in the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2253031/whats-the-go-language-really-good-for-3.html">Go language</a> ecosystem. The package, which contains a backdoor to enable remote code execution, was discovered by researchers at the application security company Socket.</p>



<p>A February 3 <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-package-exploits-go-module-proxy-caching-for-persistence">Socket blog post</a> states that the package impersonates the widely used <a href="https://socket.dev/go/package/github.com/boltdb/bolt">Bolt database module</a>. The BoltDB package is widely adopted in the Go ecosystem, with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/git

<p>Digma has unveiled <a href="https://digma.ai/technology/">Preemptive Observability Analysis</a>, an observability engine designed to reduce bugs introduced by AI code generation and other coding issues.</p>



<p>The commercial version, introduced February 5, follows a limited-capability free version. Digma said its engine provides engineering teams with code-level insight into the root cause of software development problems while adding AI-driven suggestions to resolve performance issues, architectural flaws, and problematic runtime behaviors. Preemptive Observability Analysis (POA) engine is active during the pre-production testing stage of the software development lifecycle.</p>

<p>The year was 1900 and Max Planck was a young physicist working on the problem of <a href="https://physics.info/planck">blackbody radiation</a>. This was an intense area of research because the experimental data—the radiation emitted by different types of matter as they were heated—disagreed with what had been predicted by classical physics. </p>



<p>Physics at that time was riding a wave of enormous success, and its future in explaining much of the natural world seemed certain. There were just a few loose ends to tie up.</p>



<p>One such loose end was the research showing that, when heated, solid bodies did not emit gradually increasing amounts of radiation in all frequency bands. Worse, if

<p>About 30 years ago this week, Delphi 1.0 was released. Many of you probably have no idea what Delphi is, but it was a revolutionary rapid application development environment tool. Delphi made developing Windows applications orders of magnitude faster than it had been before.<br><br>Delphi wasn’t a trivial application itself, and it was decided to deliver it on a CD-ROM (remember those?). As far as I know, Delphi was the first major software application to be shipped on a CD-ROM instead of on floppy disks, though floppies were available for purchase — all 32 of them. There were, of course, protests about it, because at the time, CD-ROM drives were fairly new and not ubiquitous.<br><br>Delphi con

<p>It’s a challenge keeping Docker images from bulking up unnecessarily. A single base image, a couple of <code>RUN</code> commands, and before you know it, you’re looking at an image weighing 200 MB or more. Is all that tonnage really necessary?</p>



<p>Odds are you can make the images you build a good deal more svelte with only a little work, and without losing any real functionality. This guide walks through six ways to create slender Docker images and keep them that way.</p>

<p>The most basic Docker image you can create, <code>scratch</code>, isn’t actually an image but an empty container that you can fill wit

<p>Traffic management is a growing challenge for cities worldwide, requiring a balance between enforcement, efficiency, and public trust. In Kazakhstan, the Qorgau system is redefining road safety through an innovative fusion of artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and mobile technology. Designed to assist traffic police in real-time violation detection and enforcement, Qorgau represents a leap forward in smart policing.</p>

<p>Amazon’s security improvements for its AWS Redshift managed data warehouse service are welcome additions, says an expert.</p>



<p>Loris Degioanni, chief technology officer at Sysdig, told InfoWorld that AWS’s enhanced security defaults for Amazon Redshift are a “necessary evolution for the accelerated cloud adoption we’ve seen across organizations with varying security expertise. Secure configurations are the first line of defense, and by enforcing best practices from day one, these changes reinforce the shift-left mindset Sysdig has long championed. However, security doesn’t stop at strong defaults — continuous monitoring, risk prioritization, and real-time threat detection are critical.”</p
