I and a couple other friends/her relatives want revenge rightfully so, and im not sure how any of this works but is there any way to hack into his IG? im desperate and quite frankly any help is appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Neon5431"> /u/Neon5431 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ii3el1/help_hopefully_at_least/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ii3el1/help_hopefully_at_least/">[comments]</a></span>

## Gmail session expired help needed!!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My phone broke and it’s the only place where I’m logged into my Gmail account, other than my MacBook. I tried logging in from my Mac book but it says “session expired” so when trying to log in, it’s sending me all verification code to the Gmail I’m trying to log into, which I don’t have access to. Does anyone know a way where I can log into without needing a verification code at all? Please I’d appreciate the help, and yes I’ve contacted Gmail but they are no help and it’s taking forever, so if anyone has an easy alternative i can do that would be highly appreciated, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/West-Oven-5782"> /u/West-Oven-5782 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ii12ae/gmail_session_expired_help_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ii12ae/gmail_session_expired_help_needed/">[co
