<p>When it comes to your home’s security, doors are your first line of defense. If you don’t already have a video doorbell–at your front door at the very least–you should consider adding one. In addition to making it easier for your visitors to let you know they’re on your porch, a doorbell camera lets you safely see <em>who</em> is on your porch, even if you’re not home at the moment. In fact, these cameras are <em>so</em> useful you might want to mount one next to every entry point into your home: side entrances, at your garage door, and the door to your backyard, for example.</p>



<p>Whether you’re watching for trouble-makers, monitoring for parcel deliveries, waiting for friends to visit, or hiding from that weird neighbor who keeps asking to borrow your lawn mower, the video doorbell is an essential security tool.</p>

<p>Most everyone thinks of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2501811/solve-your-wi-fi-problems-with-these-smart-router-settings.html">routers</a> as set-and-forget devices. But you should ditch that habit right about now, especially if you own a Netgear Nighthawk router or Wi-Fi 6 access point. Fixes for two critical vulnerabilities just got issued and they should be applied immediately.</p>

<p>Bitwarden is a beloved password manager for good reason—it’s feature-rich and its paid subscriptions cost bare pennies ($10/yr). The service is also proactive about continually strengthening security for its users. </p>



<p>Here’s the latest security update for cloud-hosted personal accounts: Starting in February, if you don’t have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1376010/how-to-use-two-factor-authentication-to-lock-down-your-accounts-the-right-way.html">two-factor authentication</a> enabled, a confirmation code will be sent to your email address when logging in from unrecognized devices.
