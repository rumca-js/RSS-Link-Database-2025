I found it most unsettling. They bully it rather tentatively, without great violence. They find it amusing, until it falls over, at which point it’s the price of the thing that seems to be the worry. This AI humanoid apparently cost $70,000 (£55,800). It’s in the care of one Kai Cenat, an internet-type person – streamer, YouTuber, influencer – you know the kind of thing. Doing the bullying were Cenat and two other gentlemen by the names of Agent and Fanum. I take it they’re in a similar line of business. The incident shown took place in the AMP house.

<p>Kennedy’s hearing signifies how close a man with medically racist beliefs is to becoming the US’s leading health official</p><p>During Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate confirmation hearing on 30 January, Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, pressed the nominee on his past claims that Black people have a stronger immune system than white people, and thereby should receive vaccines on a different schedule than them. “What different vaccine schedule would you say I should have received?” Alsobrooks, who is Black, asked the health secretary nominee. Kennedy then referenced a “series of studies” showing that “to particular antigens, Blacks have a much stronger reaction”.</p><p>The exchange is cause for alarm for many, as it signified how close a man who holds medically racist beliefs was to becoming the country’s leading health official.

<p>The easiest Derby winner ever was his greatest triumph but the horse’s fate at the hands of the IRA haunted him</p><p>Aga Khan IV, who bred and owned the magnificent, ill-starred Derby winner, Shergar, among dozens of champions to carry his famous green and red colours over the course of six decades in the sport, has died at the age of 88.</p><p>Shergar was the most emphatic Derby winner in the Classic’s 202-year history when he romped to a 10-length success under Walter Swinburn at Epsom in June 1981, but it was his subsequent kidnapping from the Aga’s Ballymany Stud in County Kildare by an armed gang in February 1983, barely a year after his retirement from the track, that projected Shergar onto the front pages of newspapers around the globe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/05/aga-khan-dies-with-mystery-of-shergar-kidnapping-still-unsolved-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Maga kingpin has only been president for a couple of weeks, but the chaos he has unleashed is already much worse than I thought it could be. I’m genuinely frightened</p><p>The day after Donald Trump won the election, everyone in my liberal corner of Philadelphia seemed shell-shocked. At preschool drop-off, a mom burst into tears. At the playground, a gay parent I know told me that they were aggressively downsizing in case they had to flee the country. Meanwhile, I felt oddly sanguine and thought people were being a tad dramatic. I rolled my eyes about Ellen DeGeneres <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/piers-morgan-ellen-degeneres-uk-move-trump-b2652376.html">relocating to England</a>. I was optimistic that Trump 2.0, while horrific, wouldn’t actually be the end of US democracy.</p><p>This was an unusual attitude for me, because catastrophising is one of my main pastimes. I spent about 10 minutes this morning staring at a red dot that has appear

<p>This moral failure and sends a clear message – the government prioritizes deterrence over dignity and cruelty over compassion</p><p>In a move that has reignited outrage, the president, Donald Trump, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5113897-trump-guantanamo-bay-migrants/">signed an executive order</a> to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Guantánamo Bay, aiming to detain up to 30,000 immigrants labeled as “high-priority criminal aliens”. For many, including myself, this decision is a painful reminder of the facility’s dark history – a history marked by torture, indefinite detention and systemic dehumanization.</p><p>Guantánamo Bay, a name synonymous with human rights abuses, was first repurposed in 2002 under then president George W Bush and defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a detention center for individuals branded as “the worst of the worst”.

<p>England’s most renowned butterfingered culprits share the lingering regret that came from a single moment</p><p>We all know what it is like to drop a catch. Remember when your colleague tossed you that Pink Lady over your desk, about eight years ago now. To the day. It was such a dolly! You malfunctioned didn’t you? Let yourself down, the apple fell on to your keyboard with an embarrassing clatter. Qwerty? Droppy more like. What about that time you fumbled the car keys off that simple over-bonnet-toss and there was a small but quite significant part of you inside that died for ever as you scrambled among the filth on the pavement. That is where you belong now, Droppy, among the dirt and grime, on the floor alongside your spilt opportunity.</p><p>The cricket writer and author Jon Hotten has come up with best description I’ve found for that truly awful feeling of dropping a catch in cricket (or indeed otherwise): “A hollowing out of the spirit.” “It’s not like failure with the bat o

<p>Is heartbreak all capitalism’s fault? Faye mixes the personal and political in this exposing but generous memoir</p><p>Sometimes, if you are a straight woman, it can be tempting to see your sexuality as a curse. It is a cliche to talk about the uselessness of men, but I do it anyway: it is a neat way of avoiding the fact that I too can be selfish and cruel to the men who go out with me. Writing in the New Inquiry in&nbsp;2019, Asa Seresin used the term “heteropessimism” to refer to this tendency among straight women. As Seresin points out, this way of thinking is not terribly helpful, because it is really an abdication of responsibility. If men are irredeemable, and loving men is always going to make women unhappy, then we don’t have to attempt the difficult work of trying to make our relationships more equitable.</p><p>What makes Shon Faye’s memoir about love so refreshing is that it resists heteropessimism, and tries to do something more hopeful.
