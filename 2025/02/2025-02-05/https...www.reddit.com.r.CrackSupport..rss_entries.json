I&#39;m only concerned about this now since I&#39;m beginning college in the fall and went through a pretty extensive reading and quizzed agreement thingy about cyber security basically saying I pledge not to use my devices to go onto the deep dark web to watch downloaded movies for free type of sites... which would potentially put the university&#39;s information at risk. Sounds pretty out there but I guess it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry. ANYWAYS can someone please help me, or anadius himself please king show up, and lmk if the packs are going to be seen as a threat of some kind or a gateway for viruses to get in? (idk how software works)</p> <p>For reference, I&#39;m probably not gonna bring my gaming laptop to college but in case I do, I want to make sure I&#39;m not gonna be swatted",
