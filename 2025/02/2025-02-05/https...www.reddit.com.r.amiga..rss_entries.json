All the enemies, level scrolling, and power ups are smooth, but my ship, weapons, and bombs, are running at only half the frames. When I turn off trumotion, my ship runs smooth again, but the rest of the game is only running at half the frames.</p> <p>Is there a way I can have everything smooth on Battle squadron in winuae, with trumotion 120. I have the most recent version of the emulator. Right now, I&#39;m choosing between my ship only being smooth, or the enemies being smooth. Not both being smooth.</p> <p>Is there a setting in winuae that can make everything in that game smooth.</p> <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Knight09able\"> /u/Knight09able </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ii3hob/need_help_running_battle_squadr",
