Reducing sulphur in the air may inadvertently increase natural emissions of methane from wetlands such as peatlands and swamps, a new study has found. The resulting additional future release of 20-34 million tons of methane each year from natural wetlands would mean targets to reduce human-caused emissions need to be more stringent than currently set out in the Global Methane Pledge.

Physicists measured how readily a current of electron pairs flows through 'magic-angle' graphene, a major step toward understanding how this unusual material superconducts. By determining how readily electron pairs flow through this material, scientists have taken a big step toward understanding its remarkable properties.

In a milestone that brings quantum computing tangibly closer to large-scale practical use, scientists have demonstrated the first instance of distributed quantum computing. Using a photonic network interface, they successfully linked two separate quantum processors to form a single, fully connected quantum computer, paving the way to tackling computational challenges previously out of reach.

## Why antibiotics can fail even against non-resistant bacteria

Antibiotics are indispensable for treating bacterial infections. But why are they sometimes ineffective, even when the bacteria are not resistant? In their latest study, researchers challenge the conventional view that a small subset of particularly resilient bacteria are responsible for the failure of antibiotic therapies.

## Missing link in Indo-European languages' history found

Where lies the origin of the Indo-European language family? Researchers contribute a new piece to this puzzle. They analyzed ancient DNA from 435 individuals from archaeological sites across Eurasia between 6.400--2.000 BCE. They found out that a newly recognized Caucasus-Lower Volga population can be connected to all Indo-European-speaking populations.

Researchers report that all nine patients in a clinical trial being treated for stage III or IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma (a form of kidney cancer), generated a successful anti-cancer immune response after initiation of a personalized cancer vaccine.

## Only seven out of 100 people worldwide receive effective treatment for their mental health or substance-use disorders

A study of 57,000 people in 21 countries finds that only 6.9 per cent who met criteria for a mental health or substance-use disorder received effective treatment. The biggest barrier to effective treatment is a person not recognizing that they need it. However, even patients who contact the healthcare system often do not receive effective treatment, for various reasons. The study quantified, for the first time, where attrition occurs at each stage along the path to effective treatment.

## Researchers discover new way to customize living materials for tissue engineering, drug delivery and 3D printing
