        "description": "Felix Contreras | February 5, 2025\nIn Cuba, pianists explore the wonderful rhythms of the island with their own percussive sense of melody. From the very first song in Roberto Fonseca\u2019s Tiny Desk, we\u2019re reminded of the Afro-Cuban jazz tradition\u2019s long history: Not only do we get a driving foundation but also the kinds of horn lines that have sounded since the 1940s when Afro-Cuban rhythms and jazz improvisation bumped into each other.\n\nThe best always make it look easy. These band members, in particular, look like they could do this in their sleep.
