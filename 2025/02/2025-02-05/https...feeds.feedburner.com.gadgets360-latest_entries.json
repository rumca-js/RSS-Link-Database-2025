Named Gibellula attenboroughii in honour of Sir David Attenborough, the fungus was first discovered in an old gunpowder store in 2021. Researchers suggest it may have medicinal applications due to its antibiotic-producing properties. More infected spiders have since been found in caves across Ireland, indicating a wider presence of the fungus.",

Using an electric field to manipulate nanoparticles trapped in vortex lines, they generated and visualised the helical motion of these quantum waves. This discovery sheds light on energy dissipation in superfluid systems and opens new avenues for studying quantised vortices. The findings could enhance our understanding of quantum turbulence and pave the way for future advancements in quantum fluid mechanics.",

        "description": "Researchers at the University of New South Wales have set a new efficiency record for kesterite-based solar cells, achieving 11.4 percent power conversion efficiency using hydrogen annealing. This method enhances carrier collection by redistributing sodium and oxygen, reducing defects, and improving charge transport. The findings, published in Nature Energy, suggest that hydrogen annealing could be a scalable solution for boosting efficiency in CZTS and other thin-film solar cells like CIGS. With its potential to enhance performance while maintaining affordability and sustainability, this breakthrough brings kesterite solar technology closer to commercial viability, offering a promising path for next-generation photovoltaics.",

        "description": "Scientists have uncovered a surprising feature of polar bear fur: a natural oil that prevents ice accumulation. Unlike penguins, which rely on feather structure, polar bears benefit from a chemical composition that keeps their fur ice-free. A study published in Science Advances found that unwashed polar bear fur performed as well as high-performance ski coatings in preventing ice adhesion. Experts believe this discovery could inspire the development of environmentally friendly anti-icing materials for skis, aircraft, and more.",
