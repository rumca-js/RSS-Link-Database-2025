It was not a perfect book\u2014because perfection does not exist\u2014but it accomplished what it intended: a joyful, entertaining and innovative (at least for western fiction) simple hero story. I recommended <em>Iron Widow</em> to anyone who even remotely demonstrated an interest in fiction and, as a fan, I eagerly awaited the sequel, which I bought on release.</p> <p>The sequel, however, I did not enjoy very much.</p> <p>My biggest issue with <em>Heavenly Tyrant</em> is that some of the flaws from <em>Iron Widow</em> persist, and they become more apparent due to the shift in the story and the author\u2019s divergence from the original premise. In this book, the author moves away from the simplicity of a straightforward hero narrative into the realm of more adult fiction\u2014rather than YA\u2014introduci",

It is very cute and sweet, not too deep sure but very fun. Recently I&#39;ve been reading Jonathan stroud&#39;s books - Lockwood and Co, Outlaws Scarlett and Browne.

But seeing as how this a forum for discussing fantasy literature in general, it suddenly got me wondering just what novels could easily work as an RPG in again a video game type concept as I was trying to see which ones could translate into one.</p> <p>For instance, let\u2019s start with the First Law series as while I have mostly read the first book so far, I kind of get Dark Souls vibes from reading the novel as it\u2019s hard to explain for those not familiar with the Souls games, but basically I could see a game studio turn the books into such a game if a game studio were to make a game directly based on the series.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid\"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1",
