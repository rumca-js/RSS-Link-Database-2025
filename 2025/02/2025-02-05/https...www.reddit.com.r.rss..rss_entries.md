Or can I just use some open-source solution that will fetch a non-existing rss feed (so I could build it myself like on <a href="http://feeder.co">feeder.co</a> builder).</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Edit: </p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mEmE7pBI1A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mEmE7pBI1A</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/priestgmd"> /u/priestgmd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ihx72k/can_i_just_select_html_and_have_it_as_rss_feed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ihx72k/can_i_just_select_html_and_have_it_as_rss_feed/">[comments]</a></span>
