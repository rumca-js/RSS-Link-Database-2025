        "description": "Chinese AI company DeepSeek recently made waves when it announced R1, an open-source reasoning model that it claimed achieved comparable performance to OpenAI\u2019s o1, at a fraction of the cost. But for those following AI developments closely, DeepSeek and R1 didn\u2019t come out of nowhere.\n\nIn this episode of YC Decoded, General Partner Diana Hu breaks down the key engineering optimizations behind DeepSeek's remarkable new models \u2014 and contextualizes them within the broader history of recent AI breakthroughs.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://yc.link/YCDecoded-apply\nWork at a startup: https://yc.link/YCDecoded-jobs\n\nChapters (Powered by https://bit.ly/chapterme-yc) - \n00:00 - Intro\n01:45 - DeepSeek\n04:40 - How Nvidia helps\n07:45 - Secret Sauce\n10:35 - Results\n12:45 - Outro",
