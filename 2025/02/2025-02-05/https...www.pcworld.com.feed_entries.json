If you don\u2019t already have a video doorbell\u2013at your front door at the very least\u2013you should consider adding one. In addition to making it easier for your visitors to let you know they\u2019re on your porch, a doorbell camera lets you safely see <em>who</em> is on your porch, even if you\u2019re not home at the moment. In fact, these cameras are <em>so</em> useful you might want to mount one next to every entry point into your home: side entrances, at your garage door, and the door to your backyard, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re watching for trouble-makers, monitoring for parcel deliveries, waiting for friends to visit, or hiding from that weird neighbor who keeps asking to borrow your lawn mower, the video doorbell is an essential security tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc",
