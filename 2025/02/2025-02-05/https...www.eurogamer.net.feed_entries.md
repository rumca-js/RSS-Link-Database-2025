RTX Mega Geometry was revealed at CES 2025 with a range of compelling demos, but now we have our first example of the technology in a shipping game: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>. There are quality, efficiency and performance upgrades but perhaps the biggest surprise in our testing is that it's the RTX 20-series and 30-series GPUs that benefit most.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-rtx-mega-geometry-in-alan-wake-2-improved-faster-more-efficient-ray-tracing">Read more</a></p>

And since 2018, Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller has allowed players to customise inputs with remarkable granularity.
