After months of anticipation, never mind the years since the original's release, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is finally playable on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. It's off to a strong start, receiving extensive critical acclaim and nearly reaching 160,000 concurrent players on Steam.

What makes for a notable experience is developer Warhorse Studios improved everything from the first game while expanding on the overall appeal. A medieval setting with realistic NPCs? There's now improved reactivity, more emergent gameplay, decisions that rely on more than stats, etc. Encouraging players to make choices and build their own version of Henry? There are hundreds of perks and even more freedom to pursue one's life of choice.

Combine this with a world teeming with incredible side quests, memorable characters, and extensive attention to detail, and you have an experience that's hard to put down. Learn more about everything that makes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 addictive.

As far as gameplay is concerned, some much hyped, already announced titles are seemingly years away from release so it would be fantastic if we get a closer look at how these games are going to play via gameplay reveals. Some entries here are a little too hopeful, but all the more reason to include them as they’ll surely drive us wild when something is announced.
