A moment when you have to ask yourself: what the hell just happened?</p><p>And no doubt we can expect many more such days in the next four years if the US president maintains his Maga “speak first, think later” persona.

Granted, Hutchings is only 5ft (1.52 metres) tall – but the heap loomed over her. “I just stood there in shock.”</p><p>Discernible among the bricks and rubble were toilet seats, office chairs, school exam papers from 15 years ago and, somehow compounding the absurdity of it all, a single hairdryer. “Nothing would surprise me as to what was in there,” says the 54-year-old business director. “It could have cost someone their life.

When she is good, she is great – and, for the most part, that was on Inside Amy Schumer, her zeitgeist-y Comedy Central sketch show that ran from 2013-2016. Schumer’s brand of comedy – bawdy, self-deprecating, pointing to overarching sexism while skewering certain types of white women – was both native to and critical of the pop feminist era, your oversharing best friend during the personal essay boom.</p><p>For better and, at least on the big screen, for worse, Schumer’s sensibility has remained there.

McBurney is as still and reflective as a lake, though you sense the currents of contemplation moving behind his eyes. Next to him, Pite can barely stay on her chair and her arms keep rising up in urgency and encouragement. Both are facing the other side of the studio, where the company’s outstanding dancers are crafting a new piece, working through details of timing and spacing as they test the viability of different moves. At the centre of it all stands a deathbed.</p><p>It’s a shock at first, but it makes sense. Pite and McBurney are working on the last part of a trilogy called Figures in Extinction.

<p>A photograph of Milagros ‘Corito’ Molina and her sons is part of a project exploring how a group of Venezuelan women went from weaving nets to using them</p><p>A woman on board a boat is a sign of bad luck; and if she is on her moon, bleeding, the sea gets angry. This is just one of the many superstitions of seafarers on the Venezuelan coast. But the economic, social and migration crisis has led to a change: a feminisation of fishing, traditionally a masculine activity. We, the all-woman Solunar collective, combine photography, local knowledge, journalism, anthropology and feminist activism to map this development, especially in the states of Aragua, La Guaira and Falcón.</p><p>The project, <em><a href="https://vistprojects.com/luna-de-agua/">Luna de </a></em><em><a href="https://vistprojects.com/luna-de-agua/">Agua</a></em>, or Water Moon, touches on the natural cycles that affect the fisherwomen’s lives, such as lunar phases and tides, and cycles of the body.

<p>A centrally heated boat proves perfect for a quiet Pennine cruise but canal maintenance and stormy weather mean plans have to be flexible</p><p>The ice creaked against the boat’s hull, slabs of it spinning out of the way. We weren’t in the Arctic on a cruise ship but steering a narrowboat in northern England, almost the farthest north you can reach on the inland waterways. There was snow on the hills. The Leeds &amp; Liverpool Canal, which climbs to 148 metres above sea level as it crosses the Pennines between the east and west coasts, had only recently thawed after a cold snap.</p><p>A canal holiday is usually thought of as a summer pastime: standing at the tiller in T-shirt and shorts, followed by evenings in canalside beer gardens. But the canals are quieter in the off season (from October to May), and it is unlikely you will find queues at locks or water points. The sparsity of boat traffic is also easier on the nerves if you’re new to steering a 30-tonne steel battering ram r
