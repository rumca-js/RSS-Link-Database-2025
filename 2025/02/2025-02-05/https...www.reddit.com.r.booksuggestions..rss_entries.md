The psychological tension between the characters, their internal struggles with lust and fidelity, and the power dynamics within relationships are themes that really resonate with me.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for more books that deal with these kinds of ideas—psychological depth and an honest, perhaps unsettling, look at relationships and human desires.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&quot;Well, it depends on your taste. If you’ve never read fiction and enjoy fantasy, then start with &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. Since you’ve probably seen the movies, it would be a safe and enjoyable read. However, if you&#39;re more interested in philosophical aspects, then go with &quot;Dostoevsky’s&quot; works—starting with the novella &quot;White Nights&quot;. If you prefer political themes, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by &quot;George Orwell&quot; is a great choice.</p> <p>If you believe in certain philosophies and want to expand your perspective, you can explore existentialism through Camus’ works. Begin with &quot;The Stranger&quot;, followed by his essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, and from there, you’ll figure out what to read next.</p> <p>For romance, &quot;Jane Austen’s&quot; novels are a great option—they can also help improve your conversational skills. Overall, reading classics is far more beneficial than any amount of self-help books.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve read all 10 books in the series by Robert Dugoni, as well as the short stories. It’s the first time in a while I’ve looked forward to reading a book, and Book 11 will be out this year. I’ve been having a hard time finding anything remotely similar to fill my time. I started the Stillhouse Lake book series by Rachel Caine, but fell off by book 3, if that helps gauge what disinterest me.
