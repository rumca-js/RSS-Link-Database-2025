<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was watching a movie last night and for what feels like the 50th time I encountered an overused joke that didn&#39;t get any reaction from me.</p> <p>The set up for the joke was that a character was using their voice activated GPS and they were trying to input their destination.</p> <p>Then the &quot;joke&quot; started. The character said they wanted to go to Burnank. Then the GPS said &quot;do you want to go to burger king?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No Burbank&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Do you want to go to the Burlesque bar?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;No Burbank!&quot; </p> <p>&quot;Destination set for baja mexico&quot;</p> <p>Wow, so funny/s. I&#39;ve seen this joke so many times but it just doesn&#39;t do it for me, and even if it was funny at some point it&#39;s been so overused by this point that it&#39;s overstayed it&#39;s welcome.</p> <p>Are there any jokes you wonder why the writers bothered to include in a movie?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3

## 1917 is my favorite war movie

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this isn&#39;t necessarily a hot take, but rewatching 1917 for the third or fourth time recently solidified it as my favorite war movie. It perfectly balances, in my opinion, all the themes of a great war movie. Hope, despair, camaraderie, isolation... this movie has it all. That, combined with amazing atmosphere and immersion (mostly due to the faux one-shot style) place this movie just above the other greats like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. Anyone who hasn&#39;t seen this movie (whether you like war movies or not) is doing themselves a disservice. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Paranoid_Droideka"> /u/Paranoid_Droideka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ii7h1o/1917_is_my_favorite_war_movie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ii7h1o/1917_is_my_favorite_war_movie/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me, I have two contenders. The first is the New Moon score by Alexandre Desplat. Dude not have to go that hard for a teenage vampire romance, but he did not phone it in. It&#39;s absolutely gorgeous. The second is the Flight of the Navigator score by Alan Silvestri. The guy left it all on the table for a movie where a spaceship voiced by Pee-wee Herman kidnaps a kid from 1979. Equal parts whimsical and heartwarming.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Jason Isaacs plays Zhukov in this... Who was Georgy Fyodorovich Zhukov?,,, im joking with the Middle name , it just feels more Russian that way ,, Zhukov at the time of these events was the 2nd most powerful man in the soviet union , if not the most admired.. the hero of Stalingrad.. he had 5 million men under his command. Safe to say ,he commanded enough loyalty to maybe take over the 11 countries under his defensive charge. But despite all that , he stays or rather pretends to distance himself from politics for fear of reprisal though this wasn&#39;t likely. But he proves himself intrepid when at the right time he steps into the limelight in the most hilarious potrayal of the dickhead hero playing coy but observing everyone and their games.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/junge_kw"> /u/junge_kw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ihyzp9/death_of_stalin_2017_jason
