								<p>I'll never cease to be amazed at the lengths intrepid <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> model converters will go to in merging their favorite pop culture icons with Games Workshop's grimdark far future. Just two months into 2025, I've been floored by another magnificent kitbash: all four of <strong>The Golden Girls</strong> as <strong>Adepta Sororitas</strong> character models.</p>

								<p>When the new <strong>DnD</strong> Player’s Handbook released in September, some players were concerned that the game was going to be far too easy, thanks to powerful new spells, more free actions and bonus actions, weapon mastery traits, and more. Reassuringly, the new Monster Manual shows that the player characters won't have it all their own way: initiative scores for the most imposing monsters are way up, and players will find themselves starting combat on the back foot more often than ever before.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Pokémon TCG</strong> has been on a <em>long</em> journey since it hit the West in 1999, and veteran voice actor <strong>Tara Sands</strong> - who voiced classic 'mon Bulbasaur and several others in the anime - has been along for most of that ride, speaking to fans of the series, videogames, and trading cards alike. "It's been interesting to see the ebb and flow of the cards' popularity," she tells Wargamer in an interview, and "it feels like it's bigger than ever right now" - but even Poké-celebs can't miss the scourge of scalpers in the community, grinding up prices for regular fans
