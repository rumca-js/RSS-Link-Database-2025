        "description": "Observability in software systems has undergone significant transformation, and one of the key players driving this change is Polar Signals. Founded by Frederic Branczyk, the company has established itself at the forefront of continuous profiling and eBPF-driven observability. In this episode of Let\u2019s Talk, Branczyk shares his journey, the inspiration behind Polar Signals, and the future of observability. \n\nBranczyk also discusses a case study where eBPF helped Polar Signals reduce their Google Cloud bill by measuring and optimizing cross-zone traffic. He emphasizes the importance of continued innovation and collaboration, highlighting how eBPF will play a crucial role in shaping next-generation observability solutions.",
