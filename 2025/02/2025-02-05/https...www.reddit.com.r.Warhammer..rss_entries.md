## Fan Animations and Fan comics: can we make them or not?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I know on their website GW states that animations are not permitted, yet recently I keep seeing animations and/or bits of animations made for fun popping around. I&#39;m confused: is there a way to actually make animations and fancomics without GW coming for you? Like some kind of special disclaimer to use or clause (like with other franchises, for example star strek which allows you to make animations up to xxx amount of running min for non profit)? If anyone has any info I would appreciate!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JakelinDM"> /u/JakelinDM </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1ii5iua/fan_animations_and_fan_comics_can_we_make_them_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1ii5iua/fan_animations_and_fan_comics_can_we_make_them_or/">[comments]</a></span>

I did manage to find a box and thought ill knock out the necrons so I can at least play and as my skills progress ill move on the space marines when im more confident painting. So after looking about for a good while I found Midwinter minis and his sandstone necrons. Easy to paint look pretty good and I can get them on the table really really easily. Fast forward all this time and I have a pretty large army now, going on 6000 points. Was the army I first got to 1000 points, first army I won a game with, first army I won a painting competition with.</p> <p>I recently found that ol Guy isn&#39;t the nice bloke he was making out to be and some of the things I have read about his escapades kinda throw a kinda crappy light on the army that I worked pretty hard on. After all it was his scheme that I followed. Now I fell kinda bumm
