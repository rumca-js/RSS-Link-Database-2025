But are there any good ones that would work well for taking out a predator&#39;s computer (been trolling this fool for a week now, it&#39;s time to put him out of business) and I think it would be a good chance to use a zip bomb and learn how they can be applied.

I wanted to ask if anyone here made anything similar and how to approach this correctly?</p> <p>How I Imagine it is I will have raspberry Pi with vulnerable system on it and I will try to perform activities like buffer overflow or RCE on it via my main PC (Kali linux on VM), by looking into known CVEs etc. Maybe I would create some vulnerable sites that I will open on the affected machine and see how far I can get or try to steal data from it.</p> <p>I would love to know how to make it safety and maybe how could I dedicate a a special network for such purpose that will be &quot;away&quot; from the world. Basically any help would be nice. Thanks!</p> <p>If stuff that I am talking about doesn&#39;t make sense, I would like to hear about it please; criticism is more than welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;ve been digging around in some stolen data logs (stealer logs, dark web, all that fun stuff), and I keep noticing a trend: huge organizations-think Fortune 500 types, and even government agencies-have a ton of compromised employee credentials floating around out there. And I&#39;m not just talking about an occasional &quot;old password&quot;. We&#39;re talking thousands or even millions of fresh, valid logins with corporate emails, all snatched up by these stealer viruses (like <em>RedLine, Raccoon</em>, you name it).</p> <p>What blows my mind is how few of these companies seem to actively monitor or track these leaks. It&#39;s almost like they either don&#39;t care or don&#39;t realize that once a hacker logs in as an employee, it&#39;s basically game over. They can move laterally, plant malware, pivot, escalate privileges-whatever. It&#39;s so much easier to do that from an authenticated position than trying to crack open the perimeter fr
