## Need help running Battle Squadron with trumotion 120 tv in winuae

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a tv that can run trumotion 120. and I have it set to smooth. But there is one problem. All the enemies, level scrolling, and power ups are smooth, but my ship, weapons, and bombs, are running at only half the frames. When I turn off trumotion, my ship runs smooth again, but the rest of the game is only running at half the frames.</p> <p>Is there a way I can have everything smooth on Battle squadron in winuae, with trumotion 120. I have the most recent version of the emulator. Right now, I&#39;m choosing between my ship only being smooth, or the enemies being smooth. Not both being smooth.</p> <p>Is there a setting in winuae that can make everything in that game smooth.</p> <p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Knight09able"> /u/Knight09able </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ii3hob/need_help_running_battle_squadr
