And this did not have to happen because it was so painfully predictable it‚Äôs not even funny. However, it did happen, but trans activists are requesting the school forget about this, as they claim it has nothing to do with the ‚Äúgender identity of the person who entered the pool locker room.‚Äù </p><p>Did this make sense?

Up first is "FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House"  by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes.

	Far be it from me to advise the Democratic Party to do anything. The more they melt down and make all the winning Trump is doing that much more glorious, the better for hustling content. However, if I may be so bold as to offer a suggestion, when the Left has grown so unhinged and discombobulated that even CNN is laughing at them, they might want to consider a different tactic. There claims that Elon Musk is forming a shadow government? LOL no.
</p><p>
	Cousin Elon is the left's new boogieman. He is Haliburton and the Koch Brothers using Project 2025 to destroy the internet if we don't pass Net Neutrality. Or that's at least the new talking point their billionaires have come up with to attack our billionaires.
