It was not a perfect book—because perfection does not exist—but it accomplished what it intended: a joyful, entertaining and innovative (at least for western fiction) simple hero story. I recommended <em>Iron Widow</em> to anyone who even remotely demonstrated an interest in fiction and, as a fan, I eagerly awaited the sequel, which I bought on release.</p> <p>The sequel, however, I did not enjoy very much.</p> <p>My biggest issue with <em>Heavenly Tyrant</em> is that some of the flaws from <em>Iron Widow</em> persist, and they become more apparent due to the shift in the story and the author’s divergence from the original premise.

That sense of magic was missing. I got many many recommendations and advice from you awesome people. </p> <p>This book stood out to me as an indie book in an array of major conventionally published books and series being recommended. Plus, it had that OG high fantasy feel that was my first love. Dragons, elves, mages, all of the classics. I’ve heard great things about it and I’ve also heard of people who hate it for being unoriginal and what not. </p> <p>But honestly? I’m almost through the first book and it’s making me SO. HAPPY.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What I love about the Wax and Steris romance:</p> <p>- They are mostly ambivalent towards each other when they start i.e no love at first sight</p> <p>- Both of them put efforts into the relationship and naturally grow closer over the next two books i.e there is a natural progression and build up without anything like a love triangle or too much drama</p> <p>- They get into a relationship </p> <p>- And then there is still story remaining once they are in a relationship. i.e the series doesn&#39;t end as soon as they get together, this is mostly because romance is not the main plot of these books</p> <p>Their relationship is so pleasant to read. It is very cute and sweet, not too deep sure but very fun. Recently I&#39;ve been reading Jonathan stroud&#39;s books - Lockwood and Co, Outlaws Scarlett and Browne. The author is fantastic - dare I say the best? - at writing the first two things. His leads are fantastic characters on their own, the closeness

Flat characters, absurd situations, terrible dialogues (don&#39;t want to offend anyone, it&#39;s a personal opinion)... It was a total disappointment. The fact is that I owe these books my love for fantasy and ttrpgs and I appreciate them for that but I think that some things are better left in the past.
