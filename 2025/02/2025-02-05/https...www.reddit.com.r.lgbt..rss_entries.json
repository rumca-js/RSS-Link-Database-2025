This is not only a legally indefensible action but also a profound moral and ethical failure. It disregards constitutional principles, ignores established civil rights protections, and sets a chilling precedent for executive overreach.</p> <p>First and foremost, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally override federal civil rights laws through executive order. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded educational institutions. Over time, courts and agencies responsible for enforcing this law have recognized that its protections extend to transgender individuals. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County reinforced this principle by holding that discrimination against transgender people is inherently a form of sex discrimination.",

Somehow, I\u2019m the only one in the family who turned out differently. I can\u2019t even blame it on me being gay, because my youngest sister is also a lesbian and HUGE MAGA supporter. I do very well going toe to toe with them most of the time. However, yesterday I had to restrain from absolutely losing it on a family member. Post said, \u201cAll humans deserve rights.\u201d Family members comment, \u201cYes but they\u2019re going about it the wrong way as usual.\u201d </p> <p>EXCUSE ME?! Other than being born in a free nation like every heterosexual person, what else do we need to do to earn basic rights? Was there a secret meeting we missed or something?! We deserve the same rights at birth! We are human..we are people. I swear, I can\u2019t fathom how they think the way they do and call themselves Christian. My family just never fails to shock. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
