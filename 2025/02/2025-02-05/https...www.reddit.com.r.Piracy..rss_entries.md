<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I usually play to the same games that are either not AAA or older than 2023; but today I tried playing three newer games from fitgirl and they all had a big disclaimer telling me even if they are offline games I can choose between restricted and complete data being sent to either Soyny or the developers.</p> <p>I might be wrong; but this didn&#39;t happen in the past, even if they sold you licenses for use and not games, they at least left you alone. But now it feels they might want to do busyness with user data, especially Sony, which who knows how many hacking incidents and data leaks they&#39;ve had in the last decade.</p> <p>To pirate a game, the requirement is that the game starts; but I don&#39;t know if crackers ever give their attention to data collection.</p> <p>Does anyone know if they disable that? </p> <p>The titles in question are TLOU1, Ghost of Tsushima and V rising by the way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr

## Emulate a smart TV on your computer to get rid of the Disney+ Windows app's 720p limit?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I recently subscribed to Disney+ to watch it on my PC. To my surprise, the streaming is limited to 720p. Having signed up for a year (what a mistake...), I&#39;m desperate to get rid of this limit, which is ruining my viewing experience. I feel a bit like I&#39;ve been ripped off. After some research, I understand that this limit is non-existent on SmartTVs or mobile devices. So I thought the solution might lie in “emulating” a SmartTV or mobile device on my computer. To this end, I&#39;d like to know if any of you have ever had this intuition, and if you&#39;ve managed to exceed the 720p limit in this way?</p> <p>I look forward to hearing from you and would be delighted to know if there are other ways of getting around the 720p limit.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/farfalla-innovazione"> /u/farfalla-innovazione </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1iik62

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been thinking about a way to distribute files without triggering ISP monitoring or traditional download flags. Here’s the idea:</p> <ol> <li><p>Instead of downloading a file directly, the file is converted into Base64 and then encrypted. The encrypted text is then hosted online as readable plain text.</p></li> <li><p>A script on the recipient’s machine reads the text from the webpage, decrypts it, and reconstructs the original file.</p></li> <li><p>Since no traditional &quot;file download&quot; happens, the ISP only sees the user visiting a webpage and reading text, not downloading a file.</p></li> </ol> <p>To handle large files, I propose:</p> <p>If the total file collection is small (e.g., &lt;2GB), each file is individually processed, encrypted, and stored as Base64 text.</p> <p>If a single file exceeds 2GB, it is split into chunks (max 2GB each), processed individually, and later reassembled locally after decryption.</p> <p>Decryption Proces

I know it&#39;s on amazon prime, but neither of us have VPN&#39;s (and that wouldn&#39;t work for screensharing, anyways). Does anyone know where (or how to) access Japanese piracy sites? And I&#39;m not talking anime here, just literally south park but Japanese. Any help would be appreciated!
