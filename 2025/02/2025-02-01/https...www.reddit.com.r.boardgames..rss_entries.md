<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would like to play Western Empires on TTS. There’s a phase in that game which is a live, simultaneous, free for all trading game (similar to Pit but calmer and asking for specific cards). If everyone is in a discord call, there will be too much talking over each other and it won’t be easy to understand what others are saying, if we use separate calls that could be cumbersome to switch between and you can’t hear the other trades happening. Any ideas on how to handle this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MediumRareBlonde"> /u/MediumRareBlonde </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ifjfhe/how_to_do_live_simultaneous_trading_online/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ifjfhe/how_to_do_live_simultaneous_trading_online/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all!</p> <p>Hope I&#39;m not stepping on any toes here, but I tried to do a different weighting on the top 100 games from Dice Tower that takes into account both the position of a game on the list and the number of lists it is on. Purely for entertainment purposes, but I didn&#39;t want to hijack the other thread.</p> <p>Essentially it assigns a &quot;1&quot; value to all games and divides that by its position on the list and then adds all of each games values together. It then takes that value and multiplies it by the number of times its referenced (number of lists it&#39;s on) and is then ordered by that final value. </p> <p>That gives the following weighted values. No better or worse than other list weightings given, but interesting to see how it changes the order!</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">Game</th> <th align="center">Weighted Score</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">Marvel United</td> <td align="center">4.8743589

## How do people decide the "best" player counts for games?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard a lot of reviews and discussions of games that say that the game in question is best at a specific number of players.</p> <p>For many games, those numbers do make sense. For example, Zoo Vadis, which is a highly interactive and simple game, seems to be generally considered best at its highest player counts in order to get the maximum interaction. Conversely, Ark Nova, a low interaction game with long turns, seems to be considered best at 2 to maximize uptime.</p> <p>However, there seem to be some games where an assigned &quot;best&quot; player count feels arbitrary. For example, I&#39;ve heard many say that Azul is best at 2 players, but I feel like there&#39;s not that much difference between 2 and other player counts. With El Grande, people say that playing it at 5 is far superior to any other count, even than 4. I&#39;m not sure what could cause people to feel that one additional player makes such a difference.</p> <p>What features
