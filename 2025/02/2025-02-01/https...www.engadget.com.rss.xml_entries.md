## Apple reportedly shelved a Mac-connected AR glasses project

<p>Apple was apparently developing augmented reality glasses powered by its Mac computers, but it canceled the project before the company could even announce it. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/apple-scraps-work-on-mac-connected-augmented-reality-glasses?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Apple scrapped the program this week because the product didn&#39;t perform well when executives tested it and the company kept on changing the features it wanted for the device. The glasses, while still powered by visionOS, weren&#39;t supposed to be the direct successor to the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-review-beta-testing-the-future-201430272.html">Vision Pro</a>.

<p><em>Bloomberg</em> says Apple originally wanted the AR glasses to be powered by the iPhone, but the smartphone didn&#39;t

## The 10 best things I saw at NAMM

<p>The 2025 NAMM Show is over. Every year music gear manufacturers, ranging from iconic synth brands like Korg, to boutique guitar pedal makers like Walrus Audio, and even companies making fog machines and knobs descend on Anaheim to show off their latest wares. It is chaos in all the ways that you’d expect a convention to be — miles-long lines for coffee, hordes of strangers jockeying for position around new products, food options that range from barely edible to instant heart attack. But NAMM is also a special beast. If you’ve ever wondered what eight out-of-sync drummers, two finger tapping guitar solos, an acoustic slide blues riff and a simple ukulele ditty would all sound like simultaneously vying for your attention, well, this is the <em>only </em>place to experience that particular brand of hell. But, now that my legs and, more importantly, my eardrums have finally started to recover I’ve had a chance to reflect on some of the best things I saw on the show floor. Here are the

## I'm glad I gave Wuthering Waves a chance even with a disastrous launch

<p>When <em>Wuthering Waves</em> launched about half a year ago on iOS, Android and Windows, there were serious issues on day one. While some can be forgiving when a game launches, especially a live-service game that will get lots of updates, the errors that many experienced were catastrophic. However, developer Kuro Games didn’t give up on the title, and it has more than recovered from its launch, even becoming a nominee at The Games Awards last year.</p>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar with <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, it’s an open-world, free-to-play action RPG similar to <em>Genshin Impact</em> in many ways. However, its combat is more focused on spectacular combos, perfectly-timed parries and dodge counters after avoiding attacks at the right moment. Some players say that the combat is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://x.com/GameBreakerGod/status/1796212778773934494">inspired</a> by <em>Devil May Cry</em> games. Heck, there&#39;s even a reference to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;po

## Sundance premiere Luz explores how VR can help us find connection in the real world

<p>We&#39;re so used to seeing virtual reality depicted nefariously in films like <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>Virtuousity </em>(a forgotten &#39;90s classic) and <em>The Lawnmower Man</em>, it&#39;s genuinely surprising to see something that treats VR  in a potentially positive way. In Flora Lau&#39;s <em>Luz</em>, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this week, there’s no major downside to VR, it’s just another way for humans to connect. And in the case of the film&#39;s two lonely leads, art gallery worker Ren (Sandrine Pinna) and pseudo-gangster Wei (Xiaodong Guo), VR serves as a life raft of human connection, something that could help them find peace in a world where they both feel adrift.</p>
<p>Set in modern-day Chongqing (a city so neon-filled and futuristic it seems more sci-fi than real) and Paris, the characters in <em>Luz</em> live alongside technology familiar to us. Smartphones and OnlyFans-esque livestreams featuring young girls are commonplace. But the virtual re
