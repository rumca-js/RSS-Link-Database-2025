<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;ve trained in IT and cybersecurity and currently work in IT at a school. I&#39;m always fascinated by how things work and how they&#39;re implemented. In my spare time, I often explore how systems can be used in unintended ways—ethically, of course.</p> <p>Lately, I&#39;ve been looking into RATs and how they can capture screenshots or recordings of a victim&#39;s device without detection. I&#39;m curious about how this happens without triggering antivirus or alerting the user. My goal isn&#39;t to create or spread a RAT but to understand the mechanics behind it—both how it works and how it might be detected.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ath0rus"> /u/ath0rus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ieylte/how_do_screenshotsrecordings_get_take_without/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ieylte/how_do_scr
