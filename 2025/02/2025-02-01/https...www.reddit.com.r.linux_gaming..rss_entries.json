Often enough I&#39;ll see ~70-90% CPU usage while my GPU usage sits at around ~30-40%. (GTX 1660ti + i5-7500).</p> <p>I tried Linux gaming for unrelated reasons and noticed one thing - games that are harder on the CPU like No Man&#39;s Sky ran better than on Windows. This might be a long shot, but is it possible that gaming on Linux helps performance in more CPU-bound situations? If so, I might be able to use that to my advantage to squeeze whatever life is left of this current setup until I build a new PC :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/n988\"> /u/n988 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1if3ubw/is_linux_gaming_better_on_a_cpubottlenecked_setup/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1if3ubw/is_linu",
