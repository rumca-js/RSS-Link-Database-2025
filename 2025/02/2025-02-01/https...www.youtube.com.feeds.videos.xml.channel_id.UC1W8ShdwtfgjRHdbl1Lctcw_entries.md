I colorized, restored, and created a sound design for this home movie of A Tour of London in the 1940s, offering a unique glimpse into the city’s streets, landmarks, and daily life during this era. This tour showcases the most iconic places and monuments of London, capturing the essence of its architecture, bustling neighborhoods, and the everyday activities of its population. From historic buildings to lively markets
