<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,<br/> I&#39;m trying to build a documentation expert - one that takes tech documentation (e.g., LangChain&#39;s docs), scrapes the docs data and turns it into a knowledge base. Users can then chat with the expert and get their questions answered.</p> <p>Given that I&#39;m ethically scraping (checking robots.txt, ToS, etc), is it legal to monetize scraped data in this form? Been seeing mixed opinions on that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shani_9"> /u/Shani_9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1if3tl3/is_it_legal_to_monetize_a_chatbot_trained_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1if3tl3/is_it_legal_to_monetize_a_chatbot_trained_on/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was wondering if anyone could help me out with an issue I&#39;ve got regarding web scraping as I&#39;m virtually brand new to this area.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been trying to make a piece of code that is able to fetch individual drug prices from multiple different pharmaceutical websites at once, in order to compare prices between them. However, each time I make a successful request, the same request doesn&#39;t work after a while due to the session ID (which must be included in the payload) expiring. I therefore have to manually log on to generate a fresh session ID from the websites in order to be able to make requests for that period. My plan to counteract this was to maybe use selenium to generate the initial session IDs, but this feels a bit clunky and inefficient. I was therefore wondering if there was anyway to perhaps navigate around this problem, or a more efficient method than what I have planned.</p> <p>For reference, the websites are as follow
