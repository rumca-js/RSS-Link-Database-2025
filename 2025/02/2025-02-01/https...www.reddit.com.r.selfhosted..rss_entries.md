<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So hello good people, I am entering the world of self-hosting, home labs, etc. I bought a QNAP NAS a few days ago and I am really enjoying it but wanted to ask if anyone has any recommendations for what I should buy to get my home lab better. I use my NAS for hosting websites and etc. I have a budget of around $2000. I would use the home lab for AI, hosting game servers (for my friends, the game is Fivem), keeping my data stored and safe. I live in Germany so if you can please look at Amazon Germany prices. I would need new gear since I am only able to buy from Amazon and not from places like FB marketplace. Thanks to anyone that has some suggestions PS. i dont have a space for home rack and etc. I have decent space but not for a Rack or anything like that. Also power usage is a not a big deal since it is quite cheap </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Weary-Bank-3415"> /u/Weary-Bank-3415 </a> <br/>

In the past I’ve developed web apps and used a managed hosting service. I thought it would be a fun project to try and self host a different web app I’ve been working on.

So I finally finished building what I&#39;m calling droplet right now, although that may change.</p> <p>In a nutshell, it&#39;s a dead simple drag-and-drop file drop service. Supports images, videos, compressed, and document files up to 20GB. Files uploaded in the same session are placed into a folder for that session to keep things somewhat organized, and for *nix folks, it will perform a clamscan (if installed) on the uploaded files. Finally, it sends the admin an email stating that a file has been uploaded.</p> <p>Runs fully in docker and settings are handled inside a .env file.</p> <p>I realize other apps do roughly the same thing, but I wanted something to do only what needed and nothing more or less, with minimal fuss, so here we are. It&#39;s not perfect right now, but it does what it says it will do.</p> <p>
