I&#39;m trying to use the GPIO pins with the DHT22 sensor. I couldn&#39;t get it to work so I measured the output of the 3.3v on the sensor and it was only around 1.3volts, which I thought was normal because it&#39;s obviously using some power. O I then tested the actual pin 1 (3.3v) and it shows as 4.7volts. it&#39;s definitely not pin 2/5v pin because that reads at 4.89v.</p> <p>Is it cooked? Or is there something I just haven&#39;t read?</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried 2 different cables and 2 power supplies - both are 60w.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bsf91\"> /u/bsf91 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1if1beh/pin_1_33v_measures_at_47v_on_pi_3_b/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1if1beh/pin_1_33v_measures_at_47v_on",
