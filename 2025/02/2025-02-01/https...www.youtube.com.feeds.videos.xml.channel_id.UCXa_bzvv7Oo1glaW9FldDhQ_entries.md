Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, originally released back in 2023, takes place almost a year after the events of the previous games. It features both Peter Parker and Miles Morales in starring roles, and sets out to tell a story that is not only more bombastic and high-stakes, but also more emotionally-driven, with plenty of character development to go around for our protagonists and their friends.

While the game fails, however, is in its PC release having a bevy of technical issues. While no fixes have been found as of yet (at the time of writing this review), whether the game will run smoothly for a specific hardware or not seems to come down to a flip of a coin. While the title runs fine for some, others have reported a wide range of problems, from terrible frame rates and visual glitches to constant crashes at random times.
