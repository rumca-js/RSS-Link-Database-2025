It&#39;s just that I have been having trouble trying to remember this old game I used to play on my family PC back when I was a kid and resorted to coming here to ask about it. I think the operating system was Windows XP, but it could have been Vista. It was a 3D sci-fi game where your pov is third person and your character travels through this tunnel shooting aliens as they appeared. I think the aliens had a red or green bulb to indicate what weapon to use to kill them. And part of the mechanic included moving horizontally to walk along the curve of the tunnel, if that makes sense. As for appearance, it was somewhat dark and gritty. Sorry I can&#39;t give more details than that. It&#39;s been more than 20 years since I played this game and I wasn&#39;t even good at it back then since I was like four. I just thought it looked cool and kept playing it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
