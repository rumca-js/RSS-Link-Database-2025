The first movie was actually released in &#39;67 but that as well as the &#39;76 release are counted as standalones.</p> <p>I was just wondering if there are any other long going movie series in any other country. </p> <p>As of right now the Beck series is at movie number 51. If you include the early ones it&#39;s number 57. </p> <p>The current series has had the same main-actor since &#39;97, and although many of the supporting actors has been switched out it still delivers. For example Vilhelm Skarsgård debuted not long ago and he is so talented.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FuckANecrodancer"> /u/FuckANecrodancer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ifhx7n/longes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Audiences have come to know the original American Pie series as an example of teen comedy revivalism that relies on crude humor to do most of the heavy lifting. I don’t really want to get into whether the humor or the manner of tackling certain subjects still holds up to this day. Personally I want to take this moment to highlight an ingredient which, in my humble opinion, is essential to the charm of the original series – I’m going to ignore the spin-offs here – and that is its subtle, but effective wholesomeness. </p> <p> Deep down American Pie 1 &amp; 2 in particular are movies about growing up, overcoming, learning and moving forward. The common thread throughout all of this is the search for and the preserving of a human connection, whether it’s a lifelong friendship or a family relationship. The characters, as immature as they may be, all stumble along the way but in the end find out that the world has other and better things in store for them

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m referring to films that push the limits on what you would call a bad guy getting their comeuppance. We all like seeing it happen, but at what point are you just as bad as they are? The first movie in this category I want to talk about is Bully. It’s based on a True story, in the late 90s some kids came to hate a friend of theirs so they brutally murdered him. The most bizarre part of the story is that 2 of the boys that participated had never met him before in their entire lives.<br/> In the movie, the murder victim is definitely a rapist and an abusive bully towards his only friend. In real life, he was possibly a rapist, certainly an abusive bully to his friend but the movie omits the fact that they both were (they would often mock a man with Down syndrome in their neighborhood and throw things at him). Feeling sorry for him is a challenge, but if you read his autopsy you just might. He was bludgeoned in the head with a baseball bat hard enough

## For those who have seen Watership Down (1978), should Woundwort be on the Pure Evil wiki?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Having surfed the Pure Evil wiki for a good enough time, I&#39;m surprised that Movie Woundwort hasn&#39;t made the cut there despite being evil enough to do so. He enslaves other rabbits and has them tortured whenever they try to escape, threatened to wipe out Watership Down in revenge for helping the rabbits escape, and brutally killed Blackavar in what&#39;s possibly the most gruesome scene in the whole movie. He has none of the redeeming/sympathetic qualities of the TV series counterpart, nor the tragic backstory of the Netflix counterpart, and he&#39;s taken deathly seriously in the movie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucky_Plan7855"> /u/Lucky_Plan7855 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1if7ec5/for_those_who_have_seen_watership_down_1978/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1if7ec5/for_those_who_have_seen_watersh

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just watched Uncharted (2022) with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. It&#39;s total check-your-brain-at-the-door escapism. I noticed that in the pre- and mid-credit scenes they teased more adventures for the characters, but as far as I know a sequel is not in the works for this movie based on a video game.</p> <p>The same thing happened with The Man from U.N.C.L.E (2015) with Henry Cavill. Further adventures were teased in the credits, but no sequel happened. </p> <p>I know there are multiple reasons why this happens. The movie is a flop, or its stars movie on to bigger and better projects. I&#39;m just wondering what other movies teased sequels that just never happened.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomConnections"> /u/RandomConnections </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1if7crm/movies_that_teased_sequels_that_never_happened/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr

She was a trendsetter and inspiration. Incredible directional debut from Ellen Kuras. Her background of cinematography shone through. They had history with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently rewatched Sicario tonight, and its left me desperately looking for a specific type of movie. I’ve heard it described on the web as a “tactical itch”. To put it in my own words, I’m looking for movies with those more realistic firefights. Staggered entries with someone taking point. Isolating angles. Clearing rooms 1 by 1. That sort of stuff. Sicario, and Triple frontier on Netflix are the best references that come to mind. Any suggestions would be much appreciated🙏🏽🙏🏽</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ohshit6969"> /u/ohshit6969 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1if3uws/requesting_suggestions_for_tactical_movies_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1if3uws/requesting_suggestions_for_tactical_movies_with/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s not a movie, but the animated TV series Over The Garden Wall is in the same direction, and so is Eternal Sunshine even though it&#39;s from far before this time. I think a lot of people probably know what I&#39;m talking about. I was thinking about this at work, and I thought of one or 2 more movies from right around 2009, but I promptly forgot them. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a &quot;fantasy movie&quot; per-se, there&#39;s just this sort of twee vibe from the early 2000s in movies with fantasy, or magically realistic scenes. Even scenes in Portlandia that involve fantasy have this vibe. I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestions, or knows what I&#39;m talking about. I know there are many more movies out there from the late 2000s and early 2010s that qualify.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JayDunzo"> /u/JayDunzo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movie

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently watched &quot;Upgrade&quot; (2018), and I can&#39;t believe how underrated this gem is. If you&#39;re a fan of cyberpunk and future technology, this movie is a must-watch. It&#39;s incredible how much the filmmakers achieved with a low budget, and it&#39;s a shame this movie isn&#39;t talked about more often.</p> <p>&quot;Upgrade&quot; is a thrilling journey into a dystopian future where technology and humanity are intertwined in fascinating ways. The story follows Grey Trace, played brilliantly by Logan Marshall-Green, who is paralyzed after a brutal attack that also claims his wife&#39;s life. When offered a chance to regain his mobility through an experimental AI implant called STEM, Grey seizes the opportunity to avenge his wife&#39;s death. What follows is an action-packed, visually stunning adventure as Grey becomes superhuman, battling both external enemies and his own internal struggles.</p> <p>The strength of &quot;Upgrade&quot; l

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Finally watched <em>Anora</em>, and while I can appreciate its raw energy and bold performances, I’m stuck on this nagging feeling that I just sat through a particularly chaotic season of <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> or some other type of reality TV I watch in the background, with WAY better cinematography. Let me be clear: the acting <em>is</em> stellar, and the film’s unflinching realism—its grimy apartments, volatile relationships, and messy emotional beats—feels intentionally jarring. But when I hear critics raving about it as a “masterpiece,” I’m left scratching my head. Did we watch the same movie? </p> <p>Maybe it’s my fault for being a genre junkie (give me a psychological thriller or existential horror any day), but <em>Anora</em>’s slice-of-life chaos didn’t quite transcend its premise for me.
