        "description": "<p>An aromatic, slow-cooked curry with a fabulous banana relish</p><p>Thirty years ago, my mother-in-law set sail on an around-the-world trip that would see her land on Antigua,<strong> </strong>where she has remained to this day. On a recent visit, I once again fell for the fish and conch rotis, and mouthwatering jerk chicken, and I particularly love the use of spicing, with turmeric-stained curries scented with allspice, coriander seeds, fenugreek and cinnamon. Those curries are mostly mildly hot, and served with mounds of steaming rice and beans to mop up their juices, as well as chutneys made with local fruit. Sunny flavours for the bleak midwinter.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/01/caribbean-mutton-curry-recipe-spicy-banana-relish-thomasina-miers\">Continue reading...</a>",

He picked out the way his team had \u201coverplayed\u201d in a couple of key moments, which he said was all down to their inexperience, and touched on a handful of decisions made by the refereeing team: a high tackle on Josh Adams which had not been punished, penalties against James Botham and Freddie Thomas which he felt had been unduly harsh. But even Gatland didn\u2019t seem persuaded by the case he was making.</p><p>The unavoidable, and uncomfortable, truth, is that Wales played pretty much as well as they can right now, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/31/france-wales-six-nations-rugby-match-report\">still came up short</a> in every respect. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was an entirely bad day at the office,\u201d Gatland said, which is a hell of an observation to make about a record defeat.
