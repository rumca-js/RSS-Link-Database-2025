<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My current gaming laptop, a ASUS ROG Zephyrus M15 died on me just a week after upgrading to the Quest 3, so PCVR is out of the question again. I&#39;m also too broke to build a new gaming rig/buy a pre-built(technically I&#39;m saving towards more important family purchases), so I&#39;m trying to see if there are any options for me to upgrade my old gaming rig(built originally in 2014) to a level where it can somewhat decently play VR games again(or at least be VR capable) and keep me limping along at least until next year.</p> <p>Here are my specs:</p> <p>CPU: </p> <p>|| || |<a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Tvzv6h/intel-cpu-bx80646i54690k">Intel Core i5-4690K 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Processor</a>|</p> <p>MOBO:</p> <p>|| || |<a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2fYXsY/msi-motherboard-z97gaming5">MSI Z97-GAMING 5 ATX LGA1150 Motherboard</a>|</p> <p>RAM:</p> <p><a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/PTkD4D/corsair-memory-cmz8gx3m2a1600c9r">C

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR; quest 3s only supports quest 3 controllers and requires a PC to set up if you dont have them</p> <p>First mistake from your&#39;s truely: headset requires PC setup when not using quest 3 controllers meaning unless you have a PC, getting one without controllers (me) will make it useless.</p> <p>While I have a PC, you cannot pair quest pro controllers to quest 3s, why??, no clue. Quest 2 could do it, quest 3 definetly can. The lower budget alternative that has minor setbacks/improvements of the first model?. Completely unsupported. Infact you&#39;re F O R C E D to use the less-functionally tracking quest 3 controllers. </p> <p>If you&#39;ve actually seen this. Thank you for reading this far.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. Sorry if this has been brought up before, but I am learning a new language and thought it would be useful to be able to practice having a conversation in my target language with AI. I know I could just speak with someone in the language I&#39;m learning but there isn&#39;t always someone available and to be honest, I get social anxiety that impedes my ability to think. I&#39;ll just grind to a halt and forget everything I learned mid conversation. With AI I think my confidence in my abilities will improve and I&#39;ll be able to think clearly when talking with a native speaker. Is there something like this that exists?

I think I&#39;ve read something like this regarding Cyberpunk, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the case with other games.
