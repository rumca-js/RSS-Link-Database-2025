        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This might not be the regular post up here but hear me out: My wife received a drawing tablet as a gift 6 years ago. She decided to use it again on her new laptop. Pressure sensitivity would not work and I could not find any drivers for it anymore. I told her: wait, I&#39;ll try Linux. I booted a very popular beginner distro on her laptop. One calibration later, Gimp worked perfectly with it! Including pressure sensitivity and pen buttons. That is a big win! </p> <p>Morale of the story: If someone is on Windows or something else and stuck with old hardware that won&#39;t work with it anymore, Linux might just help them out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ray1992xD\"> /u/Ray1992xD </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1if4sxm/linux_succes_story/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1if4sxm/linux_succes_story/\">[comments]</a></s",

We do not point fingers at the interlocutor, we speak to a person using words. We do not use only a few pre-prepared phrases when communicating with an interlocutor, our brain works and creates something not always predictable, and this gives us freedom and the opportunity to develop. Yes, emojis have been spreading lately, and people with disabilities can communicate using gestures, but words are generally the most common communication tool. For the same reason, when communicating with today&#39;s artificial intelligence, we speak to it using words, and not by pressing pre-prepared buttons with request options.
