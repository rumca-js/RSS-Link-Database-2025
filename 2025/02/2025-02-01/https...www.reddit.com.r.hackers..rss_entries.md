<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Someone is texting my GF from a phone number that is unknown to both of us. I did a reverse lookup and could only identifiy it was from my town. What can I do to learn who it is or how to get it to stop? They are texting some inappropiate stuff and they definitely know who I am. Thanks so much for any guidance, I am freaking out. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JEFFthesegames"> /u/JEFFthesegames </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iffyqm/i_need_help_with_an_anonymous_phone_number/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iffyqm/i_need_help_with_an_anonymous_phone_number/">[comments]</a></span>
