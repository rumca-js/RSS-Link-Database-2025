<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>⚠️content warning: discussion of suicide⚠️ (It appears Reddit mobile does not allow you to edit post flair, I understand if that results in this post being removed, I just thought this was an important message to send) </p> <p>Thank you to Trans veterans and service members 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇺🇸</p> <p>You have served our country with dignity, respect, integrity, honor, and honesty, character traits that our current president clearly does not exhibit and is actively working to erase from our country’s Trans veterans’ long legacy of serving our country and protecting our freedom.</p> <p>The tragic news of the recent suicide of a Trans veteran should be a wake up call for how important it is that we do not allow Trans people to feel alone and helpless right now or ever. We have to lift our Trans brothers, sisters, and siblings during this scary time and for all time moving forward. We need to make sure they know they are not alone.</p> <p>Queer people must stand

Everything about LGBTQ+ people is currently being deleted across every gov webpage and database. Literally the pages I was using, the data I was relying on for my thesis on transgender health was deleted while I was working on them, only to find 404 errors. Nothing will stop this administration from our outright removal, our existence. It&#39;s likely we&#39;re going to see this subreddit flooded with bots and misinformation. Fight this fascist regime at every stage you can.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TunaLoafed"> /u/TunaLoafed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1iezzcw/were_going_to_need_to_fight_literally_this_time/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1iezzcw/were_going_to_need_to_fight_literally_this_time/">[comments]</a></span>

## Using the wayback machine, I created a comparison of the current version of the state travel website compared to the way it was prior to the inauguration. Here is a side by side comparison, with and without where I went in and highlighted and annotated the changes. Troubling.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna lie, it&#39;s looking bad in the US for my trans brothers and sisters over there. The most recent hit being that the orange man baby has removed the T from the LGBT government website. Just remember, he wants you to be demoralised, he wants you panicking and hurting and small things like this are big victories to him.</p> <p>The chode is on the rougher side of 80 and clearly is not in good health and he will try and spend whatever time he has left wasting perfectly good oxygen trying to erase you, but here&#39;s the thing... he literally can&#39;t. He doesn&#39;t have that power. Sure, he can scrub a web page, but he can&#39;t scrub all web pages, so we just need to make sure the young get the information they need from different sources. The bottom line is he can&#39;t erase the minds of the billions of people around the work who know that you exist, who know that you&#39;re suffering, who know that you are WAY overdue for a win.</
