The first movie was actually released in &#39;67 but that as well as the &#39;76 release are counted as standalones.</p> <p>I was just wondering if there are any other long going movie series in any other country. </p> <p>As of right now the Beck series is at movie number 51. If you include the early ones it&#39;s number 57. </p> <p>The current series has had the same main-actor since &#39;97, and although many of the supporting actors has been switched out it still delivers. For example Vilhelm Skarsg\u00e5rd debuted not long ago and he is so talented.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FuckANecrodancer\"> /u/FuckANecrodancer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ifhx7n/longes",

It\u2019s based on a True story, in the late 90s some kids came to hate a friend of theirs so they brutally murdered him. The most bizarre part of the story is that 2 of the boys that participated had never met him before in their entire lives.<br/> In the movie, the murder victim is definitely a rapist and an abusive bully towards his only friend. In real life, he was possibly a rapist, certainly an abusive bully to his friend but the movie omits the fact that they both were (they would often mock a man with Down syndrome in their neighborhood and throw things at him). Feeling sorry for him is a challenge, but if you read his autopsy you just might. He was bludgeoned in the head with a baseball bat hard enough",
