<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok so I&#39;ve never really been a fan of the fantasy genre except for books like Percy Jackson or Harry Potter, but recently I&#39;ve been really wanting to get into reading more fantasy books.</p> <p>It&#39;s been hard to get recommendations without the typical Sarah J. mass recs or any of the other repeats. I&#39;ve heard of cruel prince, powerless and all those other popular books like fourth wing but I would like other recommendations.</p> <p>I read all the time, long books don&#39;t scare me, the longest book I read was over 900 pages so I don&#39;t mind a large page count. I don&#39;t have a preference on the type of fantasy books I would like to read. It can be dark, folk, have sci-fi elements and be romantic, I&#39;m not picky.</p> <p>My favorite type of genre is horror, I love dark literary fiction, thrillers and dark romance. I don&#39;t know if that will help you guys recommend me some good fantasy books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I am a romance/romcom reader. I have only recently became an avid reader, I would only occasionally read before that. I struggle with finding books to read, I try looking up tropes/topics of books I wish to read on Goodreads, but I rarely find the suggestions interesting. I am a picky reader, I really like banter, not quite sure if I am into dark romance stuff yet, also I hate when the characters have really big egos, and/or pick-me behaviour. I like smut, but I don&#39;t want it to overwhelm the book. Also I like a bit of age gap (5-8 years), and when it&#39;s appropriate (like a 27 year old, with a 34 year old), I don&#39;t like it when one character is 21 and the other is 31 for example. I am looking for books in these topics mainly, but if you have some suggestion that fits my description, but is not these topics I am also interested in that: - EMT/Paramedic romance -Military romance -Ice hockey romance -University romance -Scientist romance

While I have seen the reviews are mixed, I would probably enjoy this series and as a bonus, 3 of the 6 books are included with my Audible Premium membership. </p> <p>The Expanse series. I’m a mostly fantasy reader but have been interested in branching out into Sci-Fi more, especially after my most recent binge of the Dungeon Crawler Carl series. </p> <p>He Who Fights with Monsters series. DCC was my first dive into LitRPG, and this series has been suggested to me several times, however I am really unsure after reading several reviews. </p> <p>The Bobiverse series. Don’t know much about this one but have a friend who says I would love it. </p> <p>The Malazan Series. Seems interesting

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Made this in hopes that someone has read/knows any books like this?</p> <p>To clarify, what I mean is that if the book has a magic system, the book goes through the consequences of the magic system and has the main character utilise the consequences of the system in a genuinely smart way. Ideally the system seems simple on the outside, but hides a complexity within that only reveals itself with some ingenuity. This system could be based in fantasy or sci fi.</p> <p>What I would hope is that I could read a smart main character invent within this world, and we can see and track how the ideas about the system evolve and grow, and how the characters and world react and adapt to it.</p> <p>I guess what I am imagining is Dr Stone vibes but with a different system (not real life).</p> <p>If there is any clarification needed, please ask.

Maybe the ex started dating someone else to try and make her jealous because she wouldn&#39;t forgive him for the cheating and take him back. Bonus points if the guy she is fake dating is in a long distance (failing) relationship himself. Double bonus points if the the ex cheated with her best friend. I&#39;ve read someday maybe by Colleen Hoover already which has similar vibes but without the fake dating and I&#39;ve read the bad boy bargain by Kendra highley.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I’m 25 f and I’m just now getting into my first serious relationship. He’s a great man, we’re doing long distance and he’s the first person I’ve ever wanted to try to make it work with. I’m a very very independent person and have no healthy marriage to look up to. I used to never even want to get married in the first place. But as I’ve gotten older I realized maybe I don’t wanna be alone forever (I might change my mind.) anyways, I would love to read a book that talks about how to maintain a healthy relationship. I want to be a good girlfriend. He’s a great man but I want to make sure we have a healthy relationship as I haven’t really gotten witness this firsthand. Unfortunately I can be a bit selfish with my time and with myself and I’m learning this is not how you can be at all. Please any self-help book suggestions in this field would be great!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Real

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey! Looking for books like the title lol. Was reading some russian classics last year and liked the existentialism, but they were slow and boring. My favorite authors are Maya Angelou, Anthony Bourdain, James Baldwin, David Foster Wallace, Toni Morrison, Gabriel García Márquez, Kurt Vonnegut. Looking for a novel with good writing that isnt boring and stuffy.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been really into nonfiction but my city’s Libby is so so white. I want to read works by more nonwhite authors but so much of what I can find are memoirs. Which are fine but I don’t particularly want to read one billion memoirs. Or self help, which I also don’t want to read too much of. Preferences include history and science.
