The official, a career civil servant named David Lebryk, was put on leave and then suddenly retired on Friday after the dispute, according to people familiar with his exit.</p> <p>The system could give the Trump administration another mechanism to attempt to unilaterally restrict disbursement of money approved for specific purposes by Congress, a push that has faced legal roadblocks.</p> </div

Otherwise, you risk being furloughed (that is, not paid) or fired. </p> <p>You know what this is about. Not slimming the federal workforce, but substituting Trump loyalists for people like you, who are working for the American public. </p> <p>Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said it out loud Tuesday on CNN: &quot;The 2 million employees in the federal government are overwhelmingly left of center.” And now that Trump is elected, &quot;it is essential for him to get control of government.” </p> <p>But the fact is, neither Musk nor even Trump has legal authority to offer you eight months of pay if you’ll resign by February 6.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using Reddit for over a decade, and like many of you, have seen it evolve over the years. The current state of Reddit is just not usable anymore. The early days of Reddit were pretty awesome. You&#39;d go to a subreddit of a particular interest and people would post and comment about this shared interest. Now politics and propaganda has invaded every aspect of this site.</p> <p>This site has literally become a propaganda tool. It&#39;s not something I feel comfortable supporting anymore. My time on this site often leaves me feeling bad and worse off.</p> <p>There were two major shifts I recall which led to this downfall for me. The first was when Reddit made it impossible for all the 3rd party apps to function due to crazy high API fees. The RedditIsFun App was superior to the Reddit app in everyway. The second was when Reddit decided it would force you to consume what it wanted to show you, vs. just showing you the content of your subs

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not sure how well this has been covered nationally, but a plane just crashed into a shopping center on Cotman ave in Philly. First responders are there, but theres not a ton of information yet. </p> <p>This isn’t exactly a conspiracy, but I’ve always been terrified of planes. Most of my life its been more of an irrational fear; people would always try to calm me down, telling me things like how its safer than driving, and I get the argument. Lately I feel like my fears have become rationalized, but it seems like theres something else happening. The amount of plane crashes in the past year feels out of hand. It is so sad and alarming. </p> <p>I get the sense that there’s some weird shadowy figures involved with all this. It just seems like too many “coincidences”. Not sure if anyone else has spent time thinking about this, but I’d appreciate peoples thoughts. Wishing everyone safety in these odd times.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;
