I&#39;ve heard of cruel prince, powerless and all those other popular books like fourth wing but I would like other recommendations.</p> <p>I read all the time, long books don&#39;t scare me, the longest book I read was over 900 pages so I don&#39;t mind a large page count. I don&#39;t have a preference on the type of fantasy books I would like to read. It can be dark, folk, have sci-fi elements and be romantic, I&#39;m not picky.</p> <p>My favorite type of genre is horror, I love dark literary fiction, thrillers and dark romance. I don&#39;t know if that will help you guys recommend me some good fantasy books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

I struggle with finding books to read, I try looking up tropes/topics of books I wish to read on Goodreads, but I rarely find the suggestions interesting. I am a picky reader, I really like banter, not quite sure if I am into dark romance stuff yet, also I hate when the characters have really big egos, and/or pick-me behaviour. I like smut, but I don&#39;t want it to overwhelm the book. Also I like a bit of age gap (5-8 years), and when it&#39;s appropriate (like a 27 year old, with a 34 year old), I don&#39;t like it when one character is 21 and the other is 31 for example. I am looking for books in these topics mainly, but if you have some suggestion that fits my description, but is not these topics I am also interested in that: - EMT/Paramedic romance -Military romance -Ice hockey romance -University romance -Scientist romance ",

Due to all of the Everything going on right now, something that&#39;s been helping my anxiety is to switch to a low stakes, cozy book on Kindle before bed, rather than letting myself read anything with incoming news in it that&#39;ll give me a fresh wave of anxiety before I sleep. I do like fiction but my current preference is to read cozy, low stakes non-fiction. I&#39;ve been reading books on etymology (Word Drops by Paul Anthony Jones) and Greek mythology (Mythos by Steven Fry). It feels engaging to learn about something, without raising my heart rate or compelling me to read late into the night and affect my sleep.</p> <p>I can see there&#39;s lots more on the Greek mythology part on my Kindle recommendations, but thought I would ask you guys if you&#39;ve got other books that fit that niche for you, on topics I hadn&#39;t considered. </p> <p>Sorry if it&#39;s not much to go on. All suggestions considered and appreciated. Nothing about politi",

I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a book that puts a twist on a traditional religious story (maybe Christianity?) in a sci-fi kind of way. Or even just books that don\u2019t abide by the traditional laws of physical life. Dystopian, even?</p> <p>Some of the books/shows that I really like are: 3 Body Problem (book/show) -the presence of an alien race that is seen as godly</p> <p>The Giver (book) -everything is without color and a transfer of all memories happens to the main character. Also how everyone has a certain job </p> <p>Severance (show) -the sci-fi aspect where once they go to a lower level in the building, their consciousness changes into a different person with different memories </p> <p>Supernatural (show) -I really like this shows take on heaven, how it\u2019s just everyone in their own \u201croom\u201d that is seen as an area that they\u2019re most happy in</p> <p>I also at one point when I was younger wanted to write a book about heaven bein",

Was reading some russian classics last year and liked the existentialism, but they were slow and boring. My favorite authors are Maya Angelou, Anthony Bourdain, James Baldwin, David Foster Wallace, Toni Morrison, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Kurt Vonnegut. Looking for a novel with good writing that isnt boring and stuffy.

I want to read works by more nonwhite authors but so much of what I can find are memoirs. Which are fine but I don\u2019t particularly want to read one billion memoirs. Or self help, which I also don\u2019t want to read too much of. Preferences include history and science.
