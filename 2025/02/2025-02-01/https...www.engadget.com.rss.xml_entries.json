But NAMM is also a special beast.

However, developer Kuro Games didn\u2019t give up on the title, and it has more than recovered from its launch, even becoming a nominee at The Games Awards last year.</p>\n<p>For those who aren\u2019t familiar with <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, it\u2019s an open-world, free-to-play action RPG similar to <em>Genshin Impact</em> in many ways. However, its combat is more focused on spectacular combos, perfectly-timed parries and dodge counters after avoiding attacks at the right moment. Some players say that the combat is <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://x.com/GameBreakerGod/status/1796212778773934494\">inspired</a> by <em>Devil May Cry</em> games.
