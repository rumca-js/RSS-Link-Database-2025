        "description": "Insomniac Games has been pumping out quality games one after another this generation, and 2023's Spider-Man 2 was the developer\u2019s magnum opus. After a fair bit of anticipation, Nixxes Software has finally translated the beloved experience over to PC - and fans can finally get a taste of what it has to offer. \n\nThe game comes with plenty of features ranging from visual enhancements to quality-of-life improvements, but there are problems. With this video, we will be taking a look at the PC version of Spider-Man 2 and stack it up against the PS5 in Quality mode. Additionally, we will also be taking a look at the performance aspect of it and observe the many improvements and problems on offer.",

        "description": "Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man 2, originally released back in 2023, takes place almost a year after the events of the previous games. It features both Peter Parker and Miles Morales in starring roles, and sets out to tell a story that is not only more bombastic and high-stakes, but also more emotionally-driven, with plenty of character development to go around for our protagonists and their friends.\n\nWhile the game fails, however, is in its PC release having a bevy of technical issues. While no fixes have been found as of yet (at the time of writing this review), whether the game will run smoothly for a specific hardware or not seems to come down to a flip of a coin. While the title runs fine for some, others have reported a wide range of problems, from terrible frame rates and visual glitches to constant crashes at random times.",
