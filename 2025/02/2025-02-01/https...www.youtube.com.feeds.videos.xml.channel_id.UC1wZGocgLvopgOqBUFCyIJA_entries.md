When not out saving the world, our heroes have had another pressing matter on their minds... what to do with all their cash! Ever since they dealt with the mad King Fuzzyhug, their pockets have been absolutely bursting at the seams with the shimmering spoils from the creature's colossal platinum heart. But all that money lying around has been a worrying prospect, and there isn't a mattress in the world big enough to hide it under.
