<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So at my local library in the thriller section when you get to the books whose authors name are filed under the letter P, there are two particular people who have books filling almost whole shelves alone. </p> <p>One is James Patterson whose works I have read in the past and find hit and miss. The other is Anne Perry whose name I knew just by seeing her presence in the library. I assumed anyone with that volume of books must have been really popular but I&#39;d never gravitated to it browsing shelves because they were Victorian era novels and while I don&#39;t mind historical fiction, I don&#39;t really know enough about that time period in real history terms to follow it in fictional terms.</p> <p>Now more recently she had a few books starting around the period leading up to WW2 which is a theme I have interest in. I had completed a series of historical fiction by an author named Rory Clements in the same time period by then and enjoyed it. His prot

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Three-Body Problem is a fascinating take on first contact‚Äîone that feels more ominous than hopeful. The story is gripping, though the pacing slows down at times, especially in the middle. The book explores big ideas, from the impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution to deep moral questions: Are humans naturally destructive? Would we wipe out another civilisation to protect our own? While these themes are thought-provoking, the book doesn‚Äôt always dive into them as much as it could. The scientific concepts are mostly great, though they can feel a bit heavy at times. Despite some slow sections, the core plot is excellent, and the ending sets up an exciting sequel, The Dark Forest.</p> <p>That said, the book has a few weak points. The love interest feels unnecessary and doesn‚Äôt add much to the story‚Äîat times, it even feels forced, with characters forming deep attachments too quickly. This is also used as a plot device in ways that don‚Äôt feel natura

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to give people books as gifts quite often but as time has gone by, feel less inclined. There are different reasons for this, including the fact that there are many books out there, many are available digitally, and also the whole thing about books as gifts is not as fashionable as it once was. There was a time when there were not enough books to read and now it&#39;s more like not enough time to read. Personally I still like to receive books as gifts though. Nothing like getting a rare book you had always wanted, having it in your hands, that new book smell. Oh, and handling it so carefully as if some type of treasure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beastinsideabeast"> /u/beastinsideabeast </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1if39xd/do_you_still_give_books_or_enjoy_receiving_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comment

What I was hoping to get out of it was a story about nihilism and finding meaning in a world that is essentially temporally meaningless.</p> <p>The story did go there with Harry August&#39;s adventure seeking and other characters who can loop like him but it kind of felt more like a thriller. The resolution was okay I guess but it felt like it was la

There were times I jumped into something without this kind of preparation and things went well regardless, but other times I DNF.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Spoilers for books - Beautiful Ugly by Alice Feeney and The Perfect Marriage by Jeneva Rose</strong></p> <p>I usually like Alice Feeney&#39;s books. But in this book I felt cheated after the final twist. That it was the husband who was actually lying down in the middle of the road and tried to kill her wife. I&#39;ve recently read a The perfect marriage. In that book too towards the climax we get to know that the wife herself has killed the mistress. So during all the POV chapters of wife, there would never be a line like - &quot;I&#39;ll have to find who killed her. I&#39;ll have to get to the bottom of this secret&quot;. It would always be - &quot;I&#39;ll somehow have to get out of this legal mess&quot;. We would be thinking she&#39;s hoping to get her husband out of the mess. But it&#39;s more of <strong><em>her</em></strong> getting out of the mess. </p> <p>But in this book during the POV chapters of husband, he talks about &quot;I don&#
