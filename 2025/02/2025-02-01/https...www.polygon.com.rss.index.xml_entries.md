<p class="has-text-align-none">A twist, however seismic, can only take a story so far. Thankfully for <em>Paradise</em>, Hulu’s new sci-fi thriller in which a presidential assassination <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sci-fi/514957/paradise-tv-review-2025-hulu">is only the tip of a <em>Lost</em>-esque iceberg</a>, great performances and more interesting questions lie on the other side of revelations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While episode 1 offers a big surprise — the cast is actually living in an underground bunker built under a mountain in Colorado! — episode 2 focuses on “Sinatra” (Julianne Nicholson), a tech billionaire pulling the strings on the post-apocalyptic operation.

<p><strong>Ditto </strong>is an elusive Pokémon in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713">Pokémon Go</a></em>, as it disguises itself and you can’t actually just catch one straight-up.</p>

<p>In order to find Ditto, you’ll want to find the Pokémon that it currently disguises itself as. For example, you may see a Diglett, and it’ll stay a Diglett once you tap on it, but it’s secretly a Ditto. Once you catch that Pokémon, you’ll be met with an “Oh?” prompt, and it’ll turn into a Ditto — if you’re lucky.</p>

<p>Ditto’s chosen disguises changes from time to time, so you’ll w
