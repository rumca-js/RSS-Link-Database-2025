<p>New arrivals are set to push the population to 72.5 million but the numbers matter less than how well people fit in once here</p><p>Last week some startling numbers hit the headlines. If the Office for National Statistics is correct, net migration will add five million people to these islands in the span of a decade.

<p>Arne Slot’s team are masters of making their opponents, Bournemouth this time, look as if they are in poor form</p><p>Liverpool this season have been very good at being good enough. There have been very few games in which they’ve dismantled the opposition. They have won fewer league games by more than three goals than Tottenham have, but ended the day nine points clear at the top with their closest rivals to play the defending champions on Sunday. If Liverpool do, as they surely will, go on to win the title, it will have been an old-fashioned sort of success, a league won not by the spectacular or the flamboyant but by consistency and calmness, by ruthless accumulation.</p><p>This was Liverpool’s sixth 2-0 win in the league; more than a quarter of their games so far. It’s a scoreline that speaks of control, of winning games with a little to spare, taking freakish equalisers, ill luck and odd refereeing decisions out of the equation, without being flashy and demanding overexertion:

<p>It’s not often politicians admit to a change of heart. Perhaps it’s a trend that could – and should – catch on</p><p>In his new book, <em>Changing My Mind</em>, Julian Barnes writes: “We always believe changing our mind is an improvement, bringing a greater truthfulness to our dealings with the world and other people. It puts an end to vacillation, uncertainty, weak-mindedness. It seems to make us stronger and more mature.”</p><p>Well, maybe in literature, but not in politics, where changing your mind is akin to changing your underwear in public. Not a sign of strength, but a cause for embarrassment.

<p></p><p>Liverpool march on as league leaders, departing with no little relief from Bournemouth. Arne Slot’s team had not fallen into the traps Andoni Iraola’s team have used to sink top-four opponents this season. Mohamed Salah, with customary efficiency, scored twice to claim the three points. If his first came after a highly debatable penalty award, the second, a left-footed chip hit like a prime Tiger Woods approach shot, was a goal of inarguable beauty. It meant Liverpool had negotiated one of their most demanding remaining assignments and sent the pressure back into Arsenal’s fraying mindset. The post-match celebrations reflected the importance of victory.</p><p>A game too far for Bournemouth? They were unchanged, as necessity has demanded for weeks now, Liverpool able to field the same XI that swept aside Ipswich last week.

The short answer is yes. The longer context is that their burning desire for European glory is no secret. It was the only trophy missing from their cabinet under Emma Hayes. The 2020-21 finalists have spent years focusing on what they believed it would take to bridge a gap to Lyon caused primarily by the gap in investment. Now, with the French club hunted down by Barcelona, who have won the Champions League three times in the past four years, the focus has expanded.</p><p>How to do it, though? In the 2020-21 final Chelsea were swept aside, conceding four times in 36 minutes to a Barcelona team fuelled by the pain of a not dissimilar defeat by Lyon two seasons before in their first final. Hayes’s team did not follow a similar path, though. After their first final the gap seemed to get bigger, an anomaly se

<p>An aromatic, slow-cooked curry with a fabulous banana relish</p><p>Thirty years ago, my mother-in-law set sail on an around-the-world trip that would see her land on Antigua,<strong> </strong>where she has remained to this day. On a recent visit, I once again fell for the fish and conch rotis, and mouthwatering jerk chicken, and I particularly love the use of spicing, with turmeric-stained curries scented with allspice, coriander seeds, fenugreek and cinnamon. Those curries are mostly mildly hot, and served with mounds of steaming rice and beans to mop up their juices, as well as chutneys made with local fruit. Sunny flavours for the bleak midwinter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/01/caribbean-mutton-curry-recipe-spicy-banana-relish-thomasina-miers">Continue reading...</a>

From 1999 to 2002, he presented The Mark Steel Lectures on Radio 4, which was nominated for a Bafta when it transferred to television.

His partner is the comedian Shaparak Khorsandi.</p><p><strong>What is your earliest memory?</strong><br>
 When I was three years old, my mum and dad took the budgie cage out into the garden to clean it and I thought: “I’m going to open the door to see what happens.” Obviously what happened was the budgie flew out of the cage. I remember thinking: “Blimey, I’ve gone

<p>A creamy, savoury gratin that’s so much more than the sum of its parts</p><p>A few years ago, my recipe tester Hannah rang me to rave about a celeriac and lentil gratin she’d made from <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/pulse-9781862059863/">Jenny Chandler’s book Pulse</a>. I made it, then Hugh, my husband, made it, and then the friends we’d cooked it for also made it. Conclusion: people love it. Staring at a gnarly celeriac, some tins of tomatoes and lentils, plus a couple of handfuls of cashews, you’d never imagine they’d create something so moreish.

That may be true – but where else on British TV would you find a reality docuseries in which participants recreate the treacherous journeys undertaken by asylum seekers? Go Back to Where You Came From (Monday, 9pm) has already been the subject of social media speculation and furious comment pieces, all before a single episode has aired. A refugee charity derided it as “A Place in the Sun meets Benefits Street”, which is a truly horrifying combination, but also – unfortunately – made me want to watch it more.

## ‘Not an entirely bad day at the office,’ claims Gatland after 43-0 defeat by France

<ul><li>Wales beaten again in Paris by dominant France</li><li>Defeat extends team’s run of losses to 13 in a row</li></ul><p>Warren Gatland tried to find a good explanation for why Wales lost 43-0. He picked out the way his team had “overplayed” in a couple of key moments, which he said was all down to their inexperience, and touched on a handful of decisions made by the refereeing team: a high tackle on Josh Adams which had not been punished, penalties against James Botham and Freddie Thomas which he felt had been unduly harsh. But even Gatland didn’t seem persuaded by the case he was making.</p><p>The unavoidable, and uncomfortable, truth, is that Wales played pretty much as well as they can right now, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/31/france-wales-six-nations-rugby-match-report">still came up short</a> in every respect. “I don’t think it was an entirely bad day at the office,” Gatland said, which is a hell of an observation to make about a record defeat.
