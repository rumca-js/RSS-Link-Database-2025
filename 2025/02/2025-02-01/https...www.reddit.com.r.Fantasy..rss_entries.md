<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I was looking for some reading recommendations after finishing Malazan last summer. I&#39;ve been reading the Stormlight Archive as a palate cleaner since then, which has been a nice break since the writing goes down much easier than Malazan.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking at Memory, Sorrow &amp; Thorn as well as the Wars of Light and Shadow. I was curious what people had to say about these series? I see a fair amount of talk for MS&amp;T, but not that much on the Wars of Light and Shadow.</p> <p>Malazan is definitely the best series I&#39;ve ever read, and I know there&#39;s other books that follow it, like the Esslemont books and Kharkanas, but I feel like taking a break from that world for a bit.</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard that the Wars of Light and Shadow is somewhat similar to Malazan, but what about MS&amp;T? How would you say these series compare to something like Malazan or Stormlight? I&#39;ve also read other stuff like the Kingkiller

I believe it features either 2 or 3 teenage main characters. The book revolves around a magical element or powder that is named after a wordplay of either of these 4 words: image,imagination,picture or icon. I believe the title of the book is also the same. The element is used to make art in this fantasy world and I think if I am not mistaken, is monopolised by the rich. I read it around 9-10 years ago so I can&#39;t for the love of me recall the title. Would love to revisit it again.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Three-Body Problem is a fascinating take on first contact—one that feels more ominous than hopeful. The story is gripping, though the pacing slows down at times, especially in the middle. The book explores big ideas, from the impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution to deep moral questions: Are humans naturally destructive? Would we wipe out another civilisation to protect our own? While these themes are thought-provoking, the book doesn’t always dive into them as much as it could. The scientific concepts are mostly great, though they can feel a bit heavy at times. Despite some slow sections, the core plot is excellent, and the ending sets up an exciting sequel, The Dark Forest.</p> <p>That said, the book has a few weak points. The love interest feels unnecessary and doesn’t add much to the story—at times, it even feels forced, with characters forming deep attachments too quickly. This is also used as a plot device in ways that don’t feel natura

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I know this has been asked a lot of times during the past few years. I&#39;m actually aware of that, because I have looked all those topics up, but my situation varies at least a little: I grew to like them all.</p> <p>So far I&#39;ve read the first two WoT books, first SLA book and first Malazan book (and I&#39;ve already started DG).</p> <p>What I love about Wheel of Time: The memorable cast, the amazing, detailed depictions of each scene, slower pacing, more light-hearted and the world-building has been is truly immerse so far.</p> <p>SLA: So far a slimmer, yet also equally as memorable cast, more modern approach, straight-forward prose (thus it&#39;s an easier read), also on the more light-hearted site.</p> <p>Malazan: Amazing prose, immersive, vividly imagined world with a lot of mystery and uncertainty.</p> <p>My main issue is, that I struggle with memory. When I was younger I would have no issue reading one by one in a s

He likes drawing about &quot;fairlyland&quot; which gets him ridicule from the man he knows as his dad.</p> <p>He meets a fairy or elf girl and a whole group of her friends who wear tie dye; they&#39;re trying to get the boy to a fairy portal or something.</p> <p>A detective is looking for the boy. The detective doesn&#39;t experience hangovers but remembers every detail of what went down when his was drunk. (although this might be another book)</p> <p>Also connected is a bookseller who never opens on time so she always closes her shop late to make up for it.</p> <p>I think it ends with bookshop burning down an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I convinced my boyfriend to join a &quot;book club&quot; (it&#39;s literally just me and him lol). He&#39;s liked what I&#39;ve mentioned about Fourth Wing (specifically the dragons, military college, war), not opposed to fantasy with romance but needs a plot. For example, I think Babel would be something he could like (eventually) but I think a less intense intro to the fantasy genre would be better. If anyone has any suggestions that would be great!</p> <p>He likes Star Wars and sci-fi type things but I&#39;m not as much of a sci-fi person.
