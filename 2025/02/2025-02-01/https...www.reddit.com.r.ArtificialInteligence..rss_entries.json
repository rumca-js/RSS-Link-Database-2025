Try it: Google \u201cwatch images.\u201d You\u2019ll likely see the same 10:10 layout over and over.</p> <p>Now, here\u2019s an experiment: ask an AI tool, like ChatGPT or an image generator, to create a picture of a watch showing 3:25 or any other time different then 10:10. What do you get? You\u2019ll probably still see the classic 10:10 design watches.</p> <p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a known issue in AI and data science, but the root of the problem is surprisingly simple: <strong>data</strong>. AI learns from patterns in the datasets it\u2019s trained on. When you search for watch images online, almost all show the time set to 10:10.</p",

While LLMs and transformers have undeniably achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing, generation, and complex pattern recognition, the realization of true AGI likely necessitates a more multifaceted and potentially fundamentally different approach. This approach would need to go beyond merely increasing computational resources and training data, focusing instead on architectural innovations and cognitive capabilities not inherently present in current LLM paradigms.</p> <h4>Critical Limitations of Transformers in Achieving AGI</h4> <p>Transformers, the foundational a",
