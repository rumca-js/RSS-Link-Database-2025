I think I could mount it as rw in the volume driver options but I don&#39;t want to do this (it needs to be purely read-only from the NFS server) and I don&#39;t know why the Docker engine would be trying to chmod the volume on creation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pugglewu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was working on a project where we dockerized an API to deploy it on a Linux server. One dev said that this will perform slower, and mentioned something about I/O, I can&#39;t remember exactly. He also said that we should only spin 1 worker process for the API if we deploy it with Docker (There is no Kubernetes or anything like that). What he said didn&#39;t make much sense to me, but of course I could be wrong on this. Is it true that Docker may perform slower in certain cases? If so can anyone elaborate on when/why this is?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InfinityObsidian"> /u/InfinityObsidian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iezd03/is_an_application_deployed_with_docker_slower/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iezd03/is_an_application_deployed_with_docker_slower/">[comments]</a></span>
