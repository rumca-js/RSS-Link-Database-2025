## Help finding the name for an obscure NES top down action/rpg. Dark castle tower, similar look to The Immortal.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have dug and dug for this old game I had for NES in the early 90&#39;s to no avail.. It started with a title sequence of a village town surrounded by hilly/mountainous forests, then a dark castle tower like structure rises up out of the ground just outside town. It had a dialog to the effect of it being an evil place of legend and whoever was behind it needed to be defeated to stop the spread of darkness over the world.. </p> <p>Gameplay looked similar to The Immortal, top down kinda from the side slightly. Combat was a clunky mix of action and turn based using hit points and blocking(it said &quot;parried&quot; if I remember correctly). You used various melee weapons you&#39;d find throughout the rooms and from enemies, most of those were various monsters.. Basic goal was fight through the different floors of the tower up to the top for the final boss.. never got that far as a kid so no clue what it was, I want to say it was an evil sorcerer from

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys. Sorry if this isn&#39;t a conventional post that is allowed here. It&#39;s just that I have been having trouble trying to remember this old game I used to play on my family PC back when I was a kid and resorted to coming here to ask about it. I think the operating system was Windows XP, but it could have been Vista. It was a 3D sci-fi game where your pov is third person and your character travels through this tunnel shooting aliens as they appeared. I think the aliens had a red or green bulb to indicate what weapon to use to kill them. And part of the mechanic included moving horizontally to walk along the curve of the tunnel, if that makes sense. As for appearance, it was somewhat dark and gritty. Sorry I can&#39;t give more details than that. It&#39;s been more than 20 years since I played this game and I wasn&#39;t even good at it back then since I was like four. I just thought it looked cool and kept playing it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Over the past few years I have played around with all sorts of different ways to hook-up my retro consoles to my 4k OLED TV and the quality has always been pretty lacking.<br/> Yes I know the general consensus is to either get Retrotink, or Framemiester, or OSSC but honestly, I could never quite get on board with the asking prices. The OSSC is more reasonably prices for sure, but I never took the leap. I was about to give up and planned to pick one up in the next few weeks.<br/> I use a range of consoles, and used to have various hook-ups for them.<br/> I did shell out of a Rad2x for my N64 and was somewhat pleased as it did improve the awful picture I was getting before, but it still wasn&#39;t great so I was a little disappointed still.</p> <p>For my PS2 and OG Xbox I wasn&#39;t able to play them for ages after upgrading my tv that had composite and my new tv having no way to connect them.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I&#39;m wanting to hook up a bunch of unmodified consoles to a 480i capable CRT (Toshiba 32A43. Supports composite, S-Video, and component). The consoles I&#39;m wanting to hook up are NES, Genesis, SNES, PS1, Saturn, N64, Dreamcast, PS2, XBox, and GameCube. I believe all of these can send a SCART and component signals except NES (composite), N64 (S-video) and PS1 (component). I&#39;m wanting to run these through a system selector. I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s better to run SCART cables from the consoles that output SCART to the selector, and then using the selector to convert to a composite signal that my TV can accept.</p> <p>I want the end result to be the best possible video output without modding consoles or running an upscaler, but I&#39;m not sure if running a SCART cable to a selector that converts to component is an improvement over running component from the systems.</p> <p>Additionally, I&#39;d love to have one system select
