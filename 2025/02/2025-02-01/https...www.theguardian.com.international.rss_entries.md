<p>Wolves likely have the most OTT entrance music in the Premier League: a drum’n’bass version of Whole Lotta Love belted out over a back drop of pitchside flamethrowers and lightning flashes on the hoardings. You half expect WWE wrestlers to emerge from the tunnel, not a football team, but on this night Wolves lived up to the bombast and delivered a full metal racket of a performance to take a desperately needed three points.</p><p>A crashing drive from Jean Ricner-Bellegarde after a sweeping move across the field looked to have been enough to decide this game, only for Matheus Cunha to make it safe for Vitor Pereira’s side with a fabulous solo goal in added time. He twisted he turned, he held the ball up, then the Brazilian finally fired across Emiliano Martínez inside the far post, inspiring excelsis in the Jack Hayward stand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/01/wolves-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Now a judge has ruled he was unlawfully targeted</p><p>At 1.17pm on 15 August 2018, Sam* logged in to his online betting account and gambled five days’ worth of wages. Already deep in debt – having taken out 13 loans over three years, and with his marriage under strain – he had been desperate to quit.</p><p>But Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, operator of Sky Bet, Casino, and Vegas, had other ideas. Having labelled him a “high value” customer, and not realising he was at risk, it had sent him an email promising a £100 bonus if he spent £400 on a casino game. “Well done on making it past level 2. Can you make it even further this week?” it said. Soon after receiving it, Sam deposited £400.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/01/i-lost-10-years-of-my-life-how-uk-betting-giants-unlawful-marketing-kept-suicidal-gambler-hooked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In some of the photographs you have to squint hard to see it – sandwiched between tree trunks or cloaked in fog. In others, it’s so close up that all you see are rivets or the cross-hatching of metal beams. In his series <em>Thirty-Six Views of the Golden Gate Bridge</em> (the title nods to Katsushika Hokusai’s famous woodcut prints of Mount Fuji), US photographer Arthur Drooker set out to defamiliarise the great Californian landmark, asking: “Is it possible to see the most photographed bridge in the world anew?” After two years on the project, he came away with “deep admiration” for its builders who defied predictions that the mile-wide strait could never be bridged. “What I found most resonant,” says Drooker, “even more than the span’s status as an engineering and architectural icon, is its power as a symbol of possibility.”</p><ul><li>Thirty-Six Views of the Golden Gate Bridge is available from <a href="http://arthurdrooker.com/">arthurdrooker.com</a></li></ul> <a href="https:/

The story of love across the divide – between an enslaved Ethiopian princess and an Egyptian army captain – has enduring traction. How, though, to deal with a triumphal march, famed for an irresistibly snazzy trumpet tune, that celebrates death by numbers, all set against an uneasy, Egyptomania backdrop of pharaonic power and bloodshed? These questions are an opera director’s challenge. Robert Carsen faces them head on in his 2022 production for the Royal Opera, designed b

<p>Film’s costume designer explains how a scarf made from a blanket and some custom-made Levi’s formed key part of Timothée Chalamet’s wardrobe</p><p>It’s as central to Bob Dylan as a harmonica – it is, of course, a scarf, Dylan’s preferred accessory, and one that has become a go-to for Timothée Chalamet, who has been wearing them constantly since filming the Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. But the brown, bedraggled scarf scrunched around his neck at the beginning of the film, as a young and carefree Dylan, isn’t quite what it seems. According to costume designer Arianne Phillips, the well-worn shawl was a last-minute fix. “We had a hard time making [our original scarf] look authentically raggedy,” she says. “So that was actually a piece of blanket that we found at a charity shop. That was very last-minute – we did everything on the spot, leading up to the final moments where Timmy was walking on set, to give it that aged look.”</p><p>Otherwise it’s Dylan’s trademark denim, boots an

<p>A questionable male feminist, a closet sadist and a disaffected Twitter addict populate this acerbic story collection that captures the spirit of our doomscrolling age</p><p>In 2019, the Brooklyn-based literary magazine n+1 published a short story that went viral. Titled <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-35/fiction-drama/the-feminist/">The Feminist</a>, it follows the life of a man who turns from a bell hooks-reading Supporter of Women into a bitter moderator in an online forum about how feminism is a cancer. Rejection has hardened him over the years. In university, he always supported his friends – predominantly women – throughout their emotional crises, and was surprised to discover that his attentiveness was not rewarded with love or sex. After university, his online dates ghost him. He fears the nerves of his penis have been dulled by vigorous masturbation. The Feminist satirised in witty and lurid detail a familiar type in the online zeitgeist: the staunch male ally,
