Ke Huy Quan is going through a well-deserved career revival after his amazing Oscar-winning performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once - and now he’s a leading man in a never-before-seen genre where a mild-mannered guy is actually very good at fighting! Oh wait there have been a bunch of those movies? Oh well we still like Ke!

Love Hurts definitely raises some questions. Like why did this former assassin pick a new career that is super public-facing? Why did Rose choose Valentine’s Day to suddenly return? Why are only the innocent characters being brutally taken out? Who is Ariana DeBose’s agent and why do they hate her?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for Love Hurts!
