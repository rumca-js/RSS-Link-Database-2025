However, the setting and situations didn&#39;t quite match up to 007. Like, I distinctly remember the levels being in a sewer and it was either the game over screen or the level-completed screen, but it would have a simple cinematic of a zombie or some type of humanoid, and this creatures head being blown off.</p> <p>Doing my own searching, Bionic Commando is the only game that comes up with an exploding head, but that is not the game. </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated, I can&#39;t shake this game out of my head!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/paul_paints\"> /u/paul_paints </a> <br/",

But I&#39;ve lately been interested in getting back into PS1 games, most specifically, I&#39;ve been at work thinking about playing (and beating) Crash Bandicoot. A game I&#39;ve attempted several times but have only managed to get so far due to the game&#39;s difficulty. So, I downloaded a PS1 emulator (Duckstation) and booted up Crash yesterday. It&#39;s been a fun experience so far (and using the quick save hotkey shortcuts have allowed me to back track in a level whenever I get killed). I wish to check out even more PS1 games, some that I have played (like Spider-Man) and most importantly, games that I have never played. Like Star Wars: Power Battles, that game looks SUPER FUN! And Batman: Return of the Joker, which is my favorite Batman animated film of all time! I really can&#39;t wait to continue this long adventure and share my experience with all of you. Happy gaming, everyone!</p> </div><!-",
