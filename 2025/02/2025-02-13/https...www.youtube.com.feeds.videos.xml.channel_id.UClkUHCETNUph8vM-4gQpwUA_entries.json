        "description": "Avowed Review - Not Pillars of Eternity, But Pretty Darn Good\nIn this Avowed Review, I'm going to be talking about my experience having played about 100 hours of this game so far. I had a lot of fun playing it. It was tons of fun. I think the average player will probably get closer to around 80 hours out of it. I explored seeing the different endings and different outcomes of different quests, so I reloaded a lot and also experimented around with a lot of builds and things like that.\n\nAvowed Wiki - https://avowed.wiki.fextralife.com/Avowed+Wiki\n\nTimestamp\n0:00 - Avowed Review\n0:35 - Story and Setting\n2:47 - Gameplay\n7:30 - Audio, Visual and Design\n8:39 - Performance\n9:59 - Replayability and Game Length\n11:01 - Pricepoint\n11:50 - Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/\nCheck ou",
