I looked up some <a href=\"/r/books\">r/books</a> posts about The Silent Patient because I wanted to know what other people thought about it. Many people seemed to be disturbed that the author himself had worked as a therapist in some capacity. While the protagonist, a therapist, does some terrible things, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that we the readers are not supposed to condone or agree with his actions. Some people seemed disturbed by the author&#39;s poor depiction/understanding of therapy practices and what that means for the author&#39;s capacity to act as a therapist, which would be understandable, but I don&#39;t think that was the main critique. !&lt;</p> <p>Aside from that example in particular, I&#39;ve seen many posts and comments here criticizing authors for depicting immoral behavior, as though the author was condoning that behavior or fantasizing about be",

Beti was Cameroonian and wrote in French, but the book has been translated into English. He was much concerned with the differences between village life and city life, and apparently felt that people were giving up much more than they knew, by moving to the big city. He makes a pretty good case for that. The time period he was writing of, in this book, was the 1930s. And he doesn&#39;t describe, but mentions the existence of even larger cities than the one he displays for us. The different styles of living are on a kind of chain, and we move, in our imagination, from one to the next, each with its different attractions and drawbacks.</p> <p>But the characters are what give the book its oomph.

J. Tudor is a british writer who released her first book \u201dthe chalk man\u201d in 2018, and has since released 5 more novels and one collection of stories. As far as I know, all her books are thriller/horror adjacent. At least the ones I\u2019ve read. If you like Stephen King, I\u2019d recommend you try C. J. Tudor next. </p> <p>So far I\u2019ve read her books: - the chalk man - the taking of Annie Thorne (the hiding place in the US) - the other people - the drift</p> <p>While I have enjoyed all of her books, they are very fun to read, none of them have been 10/10 for me yet. I enjoyed the chalk man and the drift the most, and I\u2019d give them a 8,5/10 for what they are. </p> <p>However, she seems to be one of those writers who get a really cool idea for a book, but doesn\u2019t quite think it",

(Yes, a long time because I read my books from the library, and there&#39;s often holds with terribly long wait periods.) But also because one of those years was entirely dedicated to finishing The Winners.. </p> <p>I will still recommend this series to anyone who walks past me (even though this comes off as being more of a negative rant.) Simply because the first two books of the trilogy are what made me push through 672 pages of Fredrik Backman not being able to let go of his characters ( understandably) but then at the same time he wraps everyone&#39;s life up in the last 30 pages with everyone becoming successful, and the most unbelievable part\u2026 Maya being a famous singer (anytime Maya&#39;s song lyrics came up, which would take up almost an entire page it was a free skip for me). Although I will admit that Amat&#39;s conclusion made perfect sense and made me really happy. </p",
