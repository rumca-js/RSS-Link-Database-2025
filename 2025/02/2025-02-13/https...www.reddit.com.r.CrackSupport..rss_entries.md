<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I downloaded the first kingdom come deliverance repack from Dodi (yes, I triple checked it was the right website) and when I run the setup file, it just does a couple blue loading wheels and nothing happens. Antivirus was off. The file was in task manager, but kills its self after a little while. I&#39;m worried it might be malicious, but I am positive I downloaded from that actual Dodi site.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Captain_ChaosV"> /u/Captain_ChaosV </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1io8kc4/dodi_repack_setup_file_not_running/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1io8kc4/dodi_repack_setup_file_not_running/">[comments]</a></span>
