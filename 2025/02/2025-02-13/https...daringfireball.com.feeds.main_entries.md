<blockquote>
  <p>The department’s procurement forecast for 2025, which details
purchases the agency expects to make, includes $400 million for
armored Tesla vehicles. The document does not specify which Tesla
model, but the electric Cybertruck, which has a body of
high-strength stainless steel, would be the most suitable vehicle.</p>

<p>Mr. Musk spent more than $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump, who
then appointed him as the leader of a cost-cutting initiative
that’s been called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

<p>The purchase of Cybertrucks, an atypical choice for government
armored transport, is likely to raise conflict of interest issues,
especially as Mr. Musk trumpets his own efforts to root out what
he regards as unnecessary spending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Likely to raise” is doing a lot of work there. There’s just no way this is good clean procurement and everyone knows it. Either Musk should run his busin

## Apple Account Purchase Migration Doesn’t Transfer TestFlight Enrollments

<p>Sean Heber, of The Iconfactory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It appears that Apple’s new account migration stuff does NOT work
for TestFlight access. That by itself is fine - whatever. The
problem here is that it appears when someone does an account
migration, it kind of half-migrates TestFlight somehow.</p>

<p>People are telling us their new email address to invite but
TestFlight thinks they’re already a tester with that email
address! So you can’t just reinvite them. It seems we have to filter for
the user, remove them, then add them as a new tester.</p>

<p>Heber subsequently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bigzaphod/113991948583471243">replied to his own thread</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>lol - update. We tried this with a tester. I removed them from
TestFlight and then re-added with their new email. They got the
invite and then the TestFlight app said they can’t be added
because they’re already on TestFlight with the email address that
was just invited.</p>

<p>Tim Cook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.</p>

<p>Wednesday, February 19. #AppleLaunch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people are guessing, I think correctly, that this is about the iPhone SE 4. We’re also right on schedule for the M4 generation of MacBook Airs, but I don’t think MacBook Airs would qualify for “newest member of the family”. They’re more like an updated version of the current member of the family. But the next-gen iPhone SE is going to be a very different iPhone SE — it will mark the end of the Home button and Touch ID. Maybe it won’t even be named “SE” but given a new name?</p>

## Apple Has Resumed Advertising on X for the First Time Since Late 2023

<p>Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple this month started advertising on X for the first time in
more than a year. The company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">had stopped advertising</a> on
the social media platform in November 2023 following controversial
remarks made by its owner Elon Musk.</p>

<p>For example, the @Apple account is <a href="https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659">running an ad</a> promoting
Safari’s privacy features. The ad was spotted by MacRumors
contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>. The @AppleTV account has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdtechBrags/status/1888708923651440701">also
been running ads</a> for the Apple TV+ show Severance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The November 2023 outrage was in response to, among other things, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299">Musk replying</a> “You have said the actual truth” to <a href="https://x.com/breakingbaht/stat
