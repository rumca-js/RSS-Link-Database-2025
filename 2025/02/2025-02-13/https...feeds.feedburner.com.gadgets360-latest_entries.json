The system consists of two quadrupedal robots connected by a tether, allowing efficient movement in low-gravity environments like the Moon and asteroids. Unlike traditional rovers, SPLITTER\u2019s design enables stable mid-air travel without thrusters. The robot\u2019s motion is controlled using an inertial morphing mechanism based on the Tennis Racket Theorem. The team aims to enhance SPLITTER\u2019s capabilities through improved hardware and simulations for future space missions.",

Scientists estimate a 50 percent chance of an eruption at Crater Peak, though the main crater remains stable. If an eruption occurs, ashfall and air travel disruptions could be significant, similar to the 1992 event that temporarily shut down Anchorage\u2019s airport. The Alaska Volcano Observatory continues to monitor the situation closely for signs of imminent activity.",

        "description": "The universe's large-scale uniformity is under scrutiny through weak gravitational lensing. Researchers are analysing data from the Euclid Space Telescope to detect potential anisotropies in cosmic expansion. If confirmed, these findings could challenge the fundamental Cosmological Principle, which assumes the universe has no preferred direction. This study suggests that deviations in lensing signals might indicate a more complex structure than previously thought, potentially requiring revisions to the Standard Model of Cosmology. Future observations will be key in determining whether these anomalies reflect real cosmic phenomena.",
