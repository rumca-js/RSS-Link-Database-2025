Way back in the far more innocent times of 2012, we covered a brief but tense dispute between Google and Iran over the lack of a label for the Persian Gulf on Google Maps. Ostensibly so as not to upset anyone about the name of that body of water, given that there was some dispute [&#8230;]

Last July, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to have shut the door on constitutional discussions of geofence warrants. These so-called warrants operate from a point of ignorance. Investigators have no idea who they&#8217;re looking for. So, they ask Google to do some of the work for them. Casting a small dragnet around a [&#8230;]

Given that there does not seem to have been a single thing Trump has done since entering office that has been legal, nor has his lackey Musk (or is it Trump that&#8217;s the lackey&#8230;?), there is not a single thing that doesn&#8217;t require litigation to challenge and enjoin. But we&#8217;re starting to see the floodgates [&#8230;]

Here&#8217;s a story about being wrong. Not just regular wrong — we&#8217;re all wrong sometimes! — but spectacularly, publicly, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to double down again and again and again on this obviously false thing even after being corrected&#8221; wrong. This week, Elon Musk stood in the Oval Office at the White House and was finally [&#8230;]

Since his appointment by Trump in 2017, the FCC&#8217;s Brendan Carr has never stood up to telecom giants on any issue of substance to consumers. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether we&#8217;re talking about the company&#8217;s destruction of net neutrality, privacy violations, bullshit hidden fees, or its technically unnecessary usage caps, there&#8217;s nothing a company like Comcast [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s always interesting to me to see companies identify what they see as a threat by looking at what type of content they attempt to DMCA or otherwise disappear.
