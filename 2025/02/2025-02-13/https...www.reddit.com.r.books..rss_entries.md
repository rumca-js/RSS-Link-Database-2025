## Frustration with the common critique that an author's depiction of behavior implies they condone that behavior

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The impetus for this post involves some spoilers for The Silent Patient: &gt;! I looked up some <a href="/r/books">r/books</a> posts about The Silent Patient because I wanted to know what other people thought about it. Many people seemed to be disturbed that the author himself had worked as a therapist in some capacity. While the protagonist, a therapist, does some terrible things, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that we the readers are not supposed to condone or agree with his actions. Some people seemed disturbed by the author&#39;s poor depiction/understanding of therapy practices and what that means for the author&#39;s capacity to act as a therapist, which would be understandable, but I don&#39;t think that was the main critique. !&lt;</p> <p>Aside from that example in particular, I&#39;ve seen many posts and comments here criticizing authors for depicting immoral behavior, as though the author was condoning that behavior or fantasizing about be

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Minor spoilers, be warned.</p> <p>This has been a book I’ve been wanting to finish for years, ever since 2020. I heard how legendary this book and the author is so I wanted to tackle it. </p> <p>In 2021 I made a serious attempt to read it. I got around 70 percent of the way, but for whatever reason I stopped and set it down. 8 days ago, I finally committed to finishing it and finally did today. So technically I’ve kind of read this book almost twice. </p> <p>After finally finishing it, I would say I really enjoyed it, but honestly I’m more relieved than upset the journey is over. I respect this book immensely and the highs of this book are just insanely good. When Tolstoy is focused on this characters, and the scene in which these characters are steeped in, his insights are insanely impressive. Tolstoy has a way of animating his characters like Pixar that I’ve rarely seen another author do. </p> <p>Characters were excellently written, and I loved how

The style is shockingly easy to read and I’m amazed at how much I remember from the beginning of the novel. </p> <p>I’m looking forward to reading more of Lucy Ellmann’s work. She’s brilliant and I LOVE a female author putting a massive tome into the world like this. I hope to see more of it from other authors. </p> <p>However, I found myself really disliking the main character and I’m curious if anyone else had the same experience? She was so puritanical I couldn’t stand it. She literally won&#39;t allow herself to THINK the word &#39;butt&#39; without chastising herself for it and &quot;me-oh-mys&quot; for underwear. grow up. and her “mommy” issues made me cringe. </p> <p>Additionally constantly trying to convince us?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t finished it yet, but I can tell I&#39;m going to. I&#39;m almost done.</p> <p>It&#39;s a very short novel, but it packs so much in and it creates such sympathetic characters that it&#39;s just immensely engaging. Beti was Cameroonian and wrote in French, but the book has been translated into English. He was much concerned with the differences between village life and city life, and apparently felt that people were giving up much more than they knew, by moving to the big city. He makes a pretty good case for that. The time period he was writing of, in this book, was the 1930s. And he doesn&#39;t describe, but mentions the existence of even larger cities than the one he displays for us. The different styles of living are on a kind of chain, and we move, in our imagination, from one to the next, each with its different attractions and drawbacks.</p> <p>But the characters are what give the book its oomph. They&#39;re just so REAL. It&#39;s

I think I was just expecting a run-of-the mill fantasy. Little did I know that I was about to enter into the Upside Down version of our world, as written by Sir Pratchett -- so it&#39;s not quite upside down but flat and on the backs of four elephants, which are, in turn, on the back of a giant tortoise. </p> <p>I was in eighth grade and it was the first time I had been introduced to footnotes as a way for the author to speak to the reader! The idea of meta, of a wry comment, a satire all within a STORY that kept me engaged...it was so fun! I devoured all the Discworld novels after that, as well as works of other writers in a similar vein. </p> <p>I&#39;m a writer now and Sir Pratchett&#39;s in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>That’s it in a nutshell, but I’d like to get this out of me, because no one I know personally reads this authors works. </p> <p>For those of you who don’t know who we are talking about: C. J. Tudor is a british writer who released her first book ”the chalk man” in 2018, and has since released 5 more novels and one collection of stories. As far as I know, all her books are thriller/horror adjacent. At least the ones I’ve read. If you like Stephen King, I’d recommend you try C. J. Tudor next. </p> <p>So far I’ve read her books: - the chalk man - the taking of Annie Thorne (the hiding place in the US) - the other people - the drift</p> <p>While I have enjoyed all of her books, they are very fun to read, none of them have been 10/10 for me yet. I enjoyed the chalk man and the drift the most, and I’d give them a 8,5/10 for what they are. </p> <p>However, she seems to be one of those writers who get a really cool idea for a book, but doesn’t quite think it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading this entire series over the course of two years? (Yes, a long time because I read my books from the library, and there&#39;s often holds with terribly long wait periods.) But also because one of those years was entirely dedicated to finishing The Winners.. </p> <p>I will still recommend this series to anyone who walks past me (even though this comes off as being more of a negative rant.) Simply because the first two books of the trilogy are what made me push through 672 pages of Fredrik Backman not being able to let go of his characters ( understandably) but then at the same time he wraps everyone&#39;s life up in the last 30 pages with everyone becoming successful, and the most unbelievable part… Maya being a famous singer (anytime Maya&#39;s song lyrics came up, which would take up almost an entire page it was a free skip for me). Although I will admit that Amat&#39;s conclusion made perfect sense and made me really happy. </p
