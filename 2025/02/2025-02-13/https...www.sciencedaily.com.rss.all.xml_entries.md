Jumping workouts could help astronauts prevent the type of cartilage damage they are likely to endure during lengthy missions to Mars and the Moon, a new study suggests. The researchers found that mice in a nine-week program of reduced movement experienced cartilage thinning and cellular clustering, both early indicators of arthritis. But mice that performed jump training three times a week showed the opposite effect -- thicker, healthier cartilage with normal cellular structure.

Researchers have made a breakthrough in the development of 'life-like' synthetic materials which are able to move by themselves like worms. Scientists have been investigating a new class of materials called 'active matter', which could be used for various applications from drug delivery to self-healing materials.

Who hasn't been there? The big meal is over, you're full, but the craving for sweets remains. Researchers have now discovered that what we call the 'dessert stomach' is rooted in the brain. The same nerve cells that make us feel full after a meal are also responsible for our craving for sweets afterwards.
