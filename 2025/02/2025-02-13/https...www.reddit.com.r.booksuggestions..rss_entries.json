But I loved the way the book for whom the bell tolls presented a true love story that is healthy and relatable relationship with family and a good story line and a happy life but also some legit trusting and fun to read sex.

I have a copy of House of Leaves lying around and I&#39;ve heard that it has a pretty strong sadness underneath all of the complexity, but it&#39;s such a daunting read and I&#39;ve put it off for a while. I know Stephen King, of course, has several books that with this tone.</p> <p>Any recommendations? Don&#39;t really mind how strong the horror elements are compared to the sadness (or vice versa), I&#39;m open to anything spooky that&#39;ll also stir my emotions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PointMan528491\"> /u/PointMan528491 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1io7",
