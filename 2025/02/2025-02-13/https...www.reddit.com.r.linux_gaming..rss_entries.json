Thing is, based on my experience, this low market share might just be because game developers don&#39;t really reach out to Linux users.</p> <h2>How I make games</h2> <p>I make all my games on Linux first, using FOSS tools - Debian, Godot Engine, Inkscape, Blender and Audacity. Windows support comes after. With Godot Engine, porting from Linux to Windows is pretty easy once you get used to it. So basically, I&#39;m already paying for Linux development while making the game anyway.</p> <h2>Here&#39;s what my games data shows</h2> <p>I&#39;ve got two games out and one coming soon on Steam.

So my experience is quite weird because first of all, I don&#39;t have cyberpunk and witcher on steam and I had to run them using wine on lutris. I noticed that performance was kinda bad compared to Windows. On my phone right now so can&#39;t really share any screenshots but I was getting like 70-80(dlss balanced + frame gen and frame capped because of stuttering) on windows whereas on Linux I was getting less fps and stuttering is absolutely terrible. I was able to fix it somehow and got the frame gen mod to work on Linux (had to use proton experimental as its the only option right now) but even after using the same settings on Windows, with frame cap i am still having stuttering issues. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s something related to vkd3d or rebar or shader cache. Have no idea.</p> <p>Let&#39;s talk about witc",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello guys. I am sure most of you have heard of the brilliant game Medieval 2 Total War. Now, I wanted to make a big writeup here, but I realized most of you would probably never read it. The point is, I wanted to install a mod for this game called Third Age Total War, and I succeeded with the help of Proton. However, there is a submod called Divide and Conquer, which I haven&#39;t been able to install on Linux. The installer just glitches out for me. </p> <p>So I got an idea. Why don&#39;t I make a Windows 10 VM, install the mod there, and then copy all the files to my Linux installation?</p> <p>And that&#39;s what I have done. But I am not sure how to actually &quot;transport&quot; the 20 GB of data (which is the size of the mod) from the VM to Linux? I am using virtualbox.</p> <p>Any ideas? I am very frustrate rn because the files are all on my hard drive but how tf do i transport them to linux</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
