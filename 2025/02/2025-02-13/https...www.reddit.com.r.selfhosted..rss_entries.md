I&#39;ve read there are issues with protecting your own machine, proxies, etc, but I&#39;m wondering if I should start with the a VPS to get things set up and learn. How difficult would migration if i decide to bring everything in house? What should I be considering?</p> <p>2) Docker? A lot of what I read recommends using Docker, but that feels like a very steep learning curve. Any recommendations or tips to get started there?</p> <p>3) Security - Looking for something encrypted, does Cloud hosting undo the privacy aspect completely? What should i be thinking about if i want to own the data--local machine only?</p> <p>4) OS - I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hey folks,</p> <p>after spending months building a video transcription service and failing to turn it into a viable business, I decided to open-source the entire thing. It&#39;s called halfway, and it might be useful for anyone needing reliable video/audio transcription.</p> <p>Key features:</p> <ul> <li>Fast transcription of any audio/video file</li> <li>Speaker detection/diarization</li> <li>Clean, minimal editor interface</li> <li>Export to SRT, VTT, CSV, TXT, JSON, PDF</li> </ul> <p>Tech stack:</p> <ul> <li>Nextjs</li> <li>Postgres</li> <li>Minio</li> </ul> <p>you&#39;ll need your own AssemblyAI API key to run it, but they offer a free tier with 50$ of transcription. more models will be supported in the near future.</p> <p>Github: <a href="http://github.com/moaljumaa/halfwayml_open">github.com/moaljumaa/halfwayml_open</a></p> <p>No catch, no hidden agenda - just hoping someone might find it useful or interesting. Happy to answer any questions abo
