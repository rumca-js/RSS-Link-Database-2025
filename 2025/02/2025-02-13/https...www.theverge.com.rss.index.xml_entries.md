With the update, you’ll no longer have to recap previous chats or search for a thread to pick up a conversation, as Gemini will already have the context it needs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can also ask Gemini to summarize previous conversations and build upon existing projects. Google already widely rolled out the ability for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300709/google-gemini-chatbot-memory">Gemini to “remember

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve been thinking a lot about the next Xbox lately. While Microsoft publicly lines up a busy year of game releases and ports for the PS5 and Switch 2, the company has also been secretly building its future Xbox hardware and platform. There haven&acirc;&#128;&#153;t been any giant leaks about next-gen hardware yet, but Microsoft has been dropping hints over the past year that make it clear the next Xbox is going to be a lot different from the box that exists right now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Square Enix has shut down the iOS version of <em>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</em> and removed it from the App Store following an unfixable bug that blocked people from accessing content they had paid for.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The issue is due to changes made to the in-app purchases model,” Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/news/2719">says in a post</a>. “Further investigation revealed that we are unable to completely fix the bug and implement the new changes, making it unlikely to resume service for the game.” Square Enix says it started receiving reports on January 24th about the issue, which “extends to the full paid version of the game.”</p>
