Avowed reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X/S. Also available on PC.
With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian’s RPGs in the first place. However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that’s more familiar than evolutionary, and there’s bear-ly any enemy variety to keep its swords-and-sorcery battles interesting for long. Even if it doesn’t swing for the fences or leave a memorable mark on the genre, though, it’s still perfectly competent with all the tried-and-true stuff I expect, including chaotic combat, leveling systems and a loot progression that lets you build the kind of character you want to play, and meaningful decisions that can have a massive impact on the world. Plus, the whole thing’s surprisingly technically stable compared to its reliably unreliable peers. I enjoyed my time parkouring my way through Eora and think you will too – just don’t expe

Here are the best FromSoftware bosses, covering Elden Ring boss fights, Bloodborne boss fights, Sekiro boss fights, Demon’s Souls boss fights, and Dark Souls boss fights. For its next game, Elden Ring Nightreign, FromSoftware is going all-in on the bosses. This roguelike-ish Elden Ring co-op game is fully combat focused, with each of Nightreign’s runs pitting players against an increasingly difficult set of Elden Ring Nightreign bosses. And, as the first Elden Ring Nightreign trailer revealed, some of those are returning Dark Souls bosses, including the majestic Nameless King. 

With all this in mind, we asked ourselves: what are the best boss fights FromSoftware has made? We considered battles from across FromSoftware’s “Soulsborne” style games, including Elden Ring bosses, Bloodborne bosses, Sekiro bosses, Demon’s Souls bosses, and Dark Souls bosses. We assessed not just the challenge of each fight, but every element of the battle: the music, the setting, the mechanical complexity,

Captain America: Brave New World reviewed by Tom Jorgensen. In theaters February 14, 2025.
Captain America: Brave New World feels neither brave, nor all that new. Recycling The Winter Soldier’s political thriller structure (and even specific plot points) is no way to set Sam Wilson apart from Steve Rogers on the big screen, but the actors are here to save the day. Anthony Mackie’s Cap may finally be the undisputed Star Spangled Man with a Plan, but that chip on his shoulder isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and Mackie brings each side of Sam’s personality to life well against seasoned scene partners like Harrison Ford, Carl Lumbly, and Tim Blake Nelson.
