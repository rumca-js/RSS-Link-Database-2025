<p>The US president wants to end this war – and is happy to do so on Russian terms</p><p>Ukraine and its European allies braced for the worst when Donald Trump won a second term.

The Everton players, fans, stewards, ballboys are enmeshed in a throng of hi-vis and blue joy. In the middle of it stands a bespectacled man in a black puffer jacket and black bobble hat. It’s hard to tell from the footage, but he’s perhaps 50, maybe older. He is holding the corner flag aloft, waving it high in the air in his right hand – something between a medieval spear and the world’s most passionate morris dancer. He’s just scaled the Dawn Wall, he’s circumnavigated the globe. It’s a fleeting moment before a steward assumes control of the flag and our man bounces off in another direction.</p><p>I love Corner Flag Guy. I love how football has moved him in that moment. Those of us (most of us) who support success-starved clubs often question the point of it all. Everton may be the ultimate example. They were goo

It’s a hot, dry summer and two estranged brothers decline into middle age while their adolescent children wait desperately for their lives to begin. This is a world we’d expect to find in a play by Chekhov, rather than a novel by Tash Aw, who has made his name with exuberant, heavily plotted portraits of life in Malaysia and China, the characters edging between makeshift grifting and actual criminality. But now he has distilled his vision of the novel into something smaller and more intense. The South takes place on a single farm in rural south Malaysia over a single summer in the 1990s, and shows Aw breaking into newly empathetic and impactful territory with his already considerable novelistic panache and artfulness.</

<p>Yes, the TV reboot of the 80s martial arts classic is shot like a daytime soap and features dramatic moments that are often downright hilarious – but there’s a raw courage to this finale</p><p>Cobra Kai is an underdog story. It has been since 1984, when the movie The Karate Kid introduced Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio), a weedy teenager in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County, who took up karate to combat bullies and ended up defeating his nemesis Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) in the district under-18 final.</p><p>Then the franchise and its actors became the victorious underdogs. Macchio and Zabka had gappy CVs in the three decades after The Karate Kid and its so-so sequels, only to become stars again from nowhere in 2018 with a TV revival.
