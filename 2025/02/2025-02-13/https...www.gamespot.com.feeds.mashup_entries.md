<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a> is all about the loot. Whether you're just starting out and looking for the bare essentials or if you're in the endgame searching for ultra-specific gear, the quest for loot never stops. While you can simply play through the game and hope you get lucky with the right drops, farming bosses is the easiest way to force Path of Exile 2 into giving you extra loot. Farming bosses is a common strategy in ARPGs, but Path of Exile 2 doesn't simplify the process. In the guide below, we'll show you how to reset bosses so you can farm them as much as you'd like.</p><h2>How to farm bosses in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>The only way to completely reset a boss in Path of Exile 2 is by creating a new instance of the map the boss is located on. Instances are randomly generated versions of the maps you travel to in PoE 2. Whenever you leave an area and 15 minutes have passed, a new instance of the map is created if you go back

Every time you gain a new level, you can unlock a new ability. The character abilities in Avowed are split up into four categories: Fighter, Ranger, Wizard, and Godlike. However, the Godlike abilities can't be unlocked normally like the other three categories. So, for the most part, you're left to unlock abilities from Fighter, Ranger, and Wizard. </p><p>While these do represent the three main combat styles in Avowed, it's important to note that the abilities in each category can be useful for any combat style you use. For example, just because you primarily use melee weapons doesn't mean you only have to unlock abilities from the Fighter category. In fact, the other two trees feature abilities that can vastly improve the m

<p>One of the earlier side quests you can take on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/">Avowed</a> is called "Mapping the Living Lands." You accept this quest from Sanza in Paradis once you get through the first couple of story missions. Sanza employs a cartographer named Geirmund who has gone missing somewhere in Dawnshore and he tasks you with finding him, or whatever is left of him.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike other side quests in Avowed, Mapping the Living Lands gives you no quest marker on the map, so you have little idea of where to look for the cartographer. While you can stumble about for a bit trying to find Geirmund on your own, you can also look at the guide below to make things far easier on yourself.</p><h2>Dawnshore Cartographer's location in Avowed</h2><p>The only piece of information Sanza gives you about Geirmund's location is to the east of Paradis near a cave. While that might be helpful if you've already explored a large chunk of Dawnshore, that vagu

<p dir="ltr">In a similar way to how Obsidian's The Outer Worlds played very closely to a space-faring Fallout, Avowed sticks closely to the sensibilities of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Its fantasy world isn't as expansive and seamlessly stitched together, but you'd be forgiven for confusing the two at a glance, especially when you're engaged in its first-person combat. Avowed lifts some of the best aspects of the seminal RPG and improves them, especially when it comes to its refined combat. These changes extend to a move away from traditional leveling in favor of a gear-focused approach, as well as the option to experiment with wild weapon combinations. But not all of Avowed's experiments are successes, leading to an uneven role-playing adventure that surprises as much as it frustrates.</p><p dir="ltr">Washing up on the shores of the Living Lands, you play as one the Godless: a select few kissed by the grace of a god at birth and left with some distinct (and sometimes frightening)
