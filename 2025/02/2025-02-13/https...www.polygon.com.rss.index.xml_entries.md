<p class="has-text-align-none">In Dawnshore, the first region in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/avowed/444453"><em>Avowed</em></a>, the <strong>fast travel locations</strong> (party camps and beacons) allow you to zip around the map so you don’t have to walk past the same riverbed 50 times.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Camps and beacons are your primary means of quickly getting around the Living Lands in <em>Avowed</em>. Teleporting to either a camp or beacon will streamline your exploration as walking from one edge of a zone to another can take a <em>very</em> long time. However, camps and beacons can be a little hard to find as they can be hidden around the environment.</p>
