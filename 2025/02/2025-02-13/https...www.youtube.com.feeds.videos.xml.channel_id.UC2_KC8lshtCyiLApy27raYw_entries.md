Back in 2002, a special on TV tried to predict what would happen in 2025. That’s right, back when the iPod and Windows XP was the coolest thing around, humanity decided to take a shot predicting what might happen….now.

Then, it was lost. For nearly 2 decades this thing was almost impossible to find, and at one point became lost media. And that’s a shame, because this is filled with good ol early 2000s nostalgia and bad acting.

But now, in 2025, we have it again. And I’m gonna watch it.
