I chose <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com/\">bitwarden</a> (open source, free). This took me a while, as I had duplicate &amp; outdated records all over the place. But slowly one by one I added them in and cleaned everything up. This organization and centralized store for passwords really came in handy later!</p> <h1>New email (mailbox.org)</h1> <p>Obviously I can&#39;t use gmail. So I did a bunch of research, and there is no shortage of alternatives to gmail. I looked at tutanota, fastmail, posteo, and others, but landed on <a href=\"http://mailbox.org\">mailbox.org</a> because of their commitment to clean energy, UI, support for",

There\u2019s one app that I cannot delete from my iPhone: Google maps.</p> <p>Note this has nothing to do with getting directions and getting traffic. This has everything to do with the way it recommends everything from restaurants to gas stations to coffee shops in unfamiliar neighborhoods. Apple Maps and some others integrate with other platforms, but nobody can touch the recommendation algorithm that\u2019s built into Google maps. Nobody here ever talks about that.
