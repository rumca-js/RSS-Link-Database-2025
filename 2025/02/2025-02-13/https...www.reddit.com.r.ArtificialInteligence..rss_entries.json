This being said people of faith believe God is love. So by integrating AI with our daily human life, we are slowly removing what was once pure humanity and love to a heartless society eventually turning into perhaps a literal hell on earth. It\u2019s my opinion we have to set strict limits and boundaries early on while wading in this potential dangerous territory. Could AI be the Antichrist? Is anyone else concerned?

Please may I!</p> <p>Sora is somewhere similar to that price range with even both of their pro offerings allowing 50-70 a month - but anyone who has interacted with any form of ai (including LLM or image generation) knows it could take 5-10 goes to get even one concept you are trying for close to what you want.</p> <p>So I really don&#39;t understand who they are for? Who needs essentially 2 or 3x 5 second videos a month? I get that it takes a lot of processing power to create, but how is this a model that works?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cheap-Honeydew-8491\"> /",
