<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately, gaming has felt kind off bland. I played the new wow expansion, quit because its too big of a time investment. Tried poe2, decided to wait for full release, played some dark and darker for a while, but while i like it, it feels too.. unpolished? The only game ive stuck with is LoL because i have friends playing it. But playing lol feels like being in a abusive relationship. </p> <p>With this said, im looking for something &quot;breathtaking&quot; to immerse myself in. In a dream world the next elder scrolls game would be out by now, and also be amazing. But we all know none of those things is not gonna happen.. </p> <p>With that said, i know about alot of these great singleplayer titles circulating right now. And alot of them are interesting. But i think what im looking for is something online, that i can 1. Feel a sense of improvement in, and 2. Eventually get some of my friends into as well. </p> <p>Edit: thanks for alot of great suggestion

Most new games have removed all the color and fun in pursuit of “realism.” Even Mario Kart changed their rainbow blocks with a clear glass block with minimal color. I know it’s been discussed before, but I’m a big believer that developers were more inclined to make bold choices when fighting their hardware limitations.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We played our first adventure game together with Journey on the play station. But every adventure game after left her scrambling to get the best result. Fallout 3, New Vegas, outer wilds, witcher, FFXV, etc.</p> <p>Even Hollow Knight sent her in a tizzy. She cannot handle making a decision in a game. BG3........ We haven&#39;t left act 1 because she doesn&#39;t know how to keep everyone alive. </p> <p>This woman grew up gaming. She has more experience than me. But now we can&#39;t play anything together because she might mess it all up.... </p> <p>Edit: Some people are taking this post way too seriously. We still play games together, I was hyperbolic. She can beat Portal Runner for Christ&#39;s sake. I was just trying to make a fun post about making decisions in a game. </p> <p>Making decisions in a game sucks nowadays! You get locked into content or locked out (or you have to play through the same stuff again). Compound that with the time constraint
