<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I’m working on integrating a specific unit into a RISC-V core, including (probably) designing an instruction set extension. I want to make sure I get the architecture right and maximize performance, but what I’m really looking for is a broad overview of how a computer architect approaches this kind of design. What tools, frameworks, or general methodologies do you use during the exploration and design phase? Any must-know best practices or resources you’d recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/triptom"> /u/triptom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iofftb/methodologies_and_tools_for_architecture_design/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iofftb/methodologies_and_tools_for_architecture_design/">[comments]</a></span>
