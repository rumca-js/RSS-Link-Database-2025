Putting the moral implications of that aside\u2026.he has children not even able to rent a car, and some can\u2019t legally drink, accessing our information. Reports of downloading that information to external hard drives. Giving IT access to a private citizen who currently runs his own private IT company etc\u2026why are people not alarmed by all of this? Is there anything to be done? Would love to know what folks on this thread think of all this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gratefulanddriven\"> /u/Gratefulanddriven </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ioo4rg/dodge_biggest_security_risk_in_nations_history/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/com",
