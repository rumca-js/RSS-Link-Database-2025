Even back then, before DLSS was introduced by Nvidia, he explained that the reduction in pixel rendering could be upscaled using deep learning.</p> <p>Currently, most VR users don&#39;t have access to technologies like eye tracking and foveated rendering because the overwhelming majority are using a Quest 2 or Quest 3, even on the PC platform. If the Valve Deckard launches with eye tracking and foveated rendering built into its pipeline, I assume it will set a new standard for the VR industry, pushing developers to implement these technologies in future titles.</p> <p>That brings me to my questions:</p> <ol> <li>Assuming the Deckard releases in 2025, when do you think foveated rendering will become a standard feature in most, if not all, newly released VR games?</li> <li>Will Nvidia devel",

I&#39;m mainly concerned if I will be able to play my entire 2D steam library via streaming from my desktop to the Quest 3 headset.</p> <p>Is there any way to just have a basic 2D game displayed in front of my vision while I use a mouse and keyboard to play? &quot;Virtual Desktop&quot; is something I have looked into, but all of the youtube videos show a &quot;fake&quot; monitor while playing the game. I would like the entire field of view to be just the game.</p> <p>Lastly, if the above is possible, will the performance mainly depend on how good of a wifi router I have? My Desktop has a 13900K &amp; RTX 4090. So say if I can run a game on the desktop @ 120 FPS 1440p, would it be streamed to the headset with the same amount of frames (assuming wifi connection is good)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>VRMMOs are struggling to survive because developers are failing to properly balance their games. One of the biggest issues is the speed at which players reach max level. In recent MMOs, players can go from level 1 to the max level in an incredibly short time, leaving them with little to do. Content takes time to develop, and when everyone has already maxed out their skills and exhausted available content, the game quickly dies out. Developers simply can\u2019t keep up, and players leave before new content can be released.</p> <p>Another major flaw is the lack of proper class balancing. Every class often ends up feeling the same, stripping away the uniqueness that makes RPGs engaging. Players want to feel distinct from one another. For example, an assassin-type class should have greater movement abilities, allowing for quick engagements, burst damage, and fast retreats.

My lab got this because of the eye tracking, and I collected the data on a previous study just fine. I used the same script for a new study, that is eye-tracking based, but it isn&#39;t collecting any ET data. I&#39;ve reset/updating everything and no luck. I added a bunch of debug statements and gaze calibrated is coming back as false (even though I&#39;m calibrating in Varjo Base prior) and gaze data status is coming back as invalid. I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s a hardware issue.
