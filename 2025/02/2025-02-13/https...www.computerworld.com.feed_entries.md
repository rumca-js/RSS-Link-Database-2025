<p>Chatbots quickly surpassed human physicians in diagnostic reasoning — the crucial first step in clinical care — according to a new study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03456-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in the journal <em>Nature Medicine</em></a>.</p>



<p>The study suggests physicians who have access to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs), which underpin generative AI (genAI)

<p>OpenAI will integrate “o3” into GPT-5 instead of releasing it separately, streamlining adoption while signaling a shift toward fewer, more controlled AI models amid rising competition and cost pressures.</p>



<p>“In both ChatGPT and our API, we will release GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of our technology, including o3,” CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X.</p>



<p>The decision marks a departure from OpenAI’s recent strategy of offering multiple model variants, suggesting the company is prioritizing ease of deployment and product clarity for enterprise users.</p>



<p>“We want AI to ‘just work’ for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten,” Altman

<p>When the EU on Tuesday said it was not, at this time, moving ahead with critical legislation involving privacy and genAI liability issues, it honestly reported that members couldn’t agree. But the reasons <em>why </em>they couldn’t agree get much more complicated.</p>



<p>The EU decisions involved two seemingly unrelated pieces of legislation: One dealing with privacy efforts, often called the cookie law, and the other dealing with AI liability. </p>



<p>The EU decisions are in <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/7617998c-86e6-4a74-b33c-249e8a7938cd_en?filename=COM_2025_45_1_annexes_EN.pdf">the annexes to the Commission’s  work programme for 2025</a>, in Annex IV, items

<p>Enterprises still hosting on-premises Exchange mail, it’s time to face reality: Microsoft will soon no longer support your infrastructure.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the tech giant released its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=106402">final roll-up patch</a> for Exchange Server 2019 (Cumulative Update 15). On October 14, Microsoft will <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1613841/migrating-to-hosted-exchange-do-s-and-don-ts.html">officially stop supporting</a> both Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 — meaning no more updates, technical help, bug fixes, or security patches.</p>
