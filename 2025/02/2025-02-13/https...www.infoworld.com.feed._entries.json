The Mutex and Semaphore classes in .NET represent two of the most important related concepts. Let\u2019s understand what both of these do and when we should use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin our discussion, let\u2019s take a quick look at the basic concepts. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multi-threading allows us to perform several tasks simultaneously. By synchronizing threads, we increase our application\u2019s overall throughput and avoid problems like contention, deadlocks, and data loss. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"inter-process-communication-vs-inter-thr",
