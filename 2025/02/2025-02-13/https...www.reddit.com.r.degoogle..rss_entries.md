If I need a private email, i&#39;ll use burners and other stuff, not my main account. </p> <p>It looks like a lot of mail alternatives are focused on privacy, and also include accounts auto-deleting themselves from lack of payment or inactivity. I&#39;d feel a lot safer if my main email wasn&#39;t at risk of disappearing if I lost my job and couldn&#39;t pay, or if I take a year to just unplug from all electronics, you know? I want to be able to just live my life however and not worry about something as important as an email account disappearing and becoming totally unrecoverable. </p> <p>It looks like the o

But we use docs and sheets in conjunction with OneDrive to access files on the go and also keep them accessible across all our devices. </p> <p>But we want to use something other than OneDrive not to get away from all big business but because, simply put, OneDrive is very problematic for us for syncing properly and we don&#39;t use MS Office online because (apart from the fact that you have to pay to use it on a phone) if you&#39;ve ever used Online Word and Excel, you know just how frustrating the UI is, opening a file, choosing to edit, picking a cell or a place on the document is all infuriating. Google Docs just worked smoother, but now we don&#39;t want to use Google applications anymore.</p> <p>So does anyone know of another online Office Suite that can be online and that we can also use with some other Cloud Storage (we have Filen) to access these docume
