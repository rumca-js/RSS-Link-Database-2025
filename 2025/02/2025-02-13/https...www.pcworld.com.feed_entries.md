<p>A monitor arm is one of the best upgrades you can make to a home office setup. A good-quality arm not only frees up usable space on your desk’s surface, it enables more ways to move and position your display/s for optimal comfort and ergonomics.

<p>A few days ago, Microsoft manifested something that had been a long time coming: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2575334/the-new-outlook-app-has-been-force-installed-on-windows-10-pcs.html">forced installation of the new Outlook app</a> on Windows 10 PCs by way of the February 2025 mandatory update. This is the next step in Microsoft’s push to make the new Outlook commonplace.</p>



<p>Previously, Microsoft had emphasized that there was no way to prevent the forced installation of new Outlook. But that was a lie. Apparently there’s a trick you can use to prevent new Outlook’s forced installation, spotted by <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/02/13/block-outlook-new-from-installing-with-windows-10-kb5051974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Latest</a>.</p>
