<p>This big-hearted tale sees a 99-year-old woman reckoning with the inheritance of the past</p><p>Before I introduce you to our narrator, a few weeks shy of her 100th birthday, you’d better take a moment to prepare yourself. Tuck that shirt in. Stand up straight. Fix your hair. And for goodness sake, don’t patronise her. Our heroine – mother, grandmother; friend, lover, widow; a successful ganja farmer; a survivor, who sleeps with a cutlass under her pillow – is a force to be reckoned with. “Me is not you fuckin Granny,” she snaps, early in the book. “Me haunt you for fuckin <em>ever</em> if you mek me die inna hospital,” she threatens, later on. Pauline Evadne Sinclair is her full name – Miss Pauline, to you and me.</p><p>We are in Jamaica. Not the touristy coastal towns, but inland: a quiet village in St Mary parish, Mason Hall. Miss Pauline’s life is rooted in this soil:&nbsp;she was born here; she and her partner, Clive, built a house and raised their family. She lives alone now

<p>The Berlinale opens today to an industry thriving on EU funds. But where is the money going – and are audiences benefiting too?</p><p>European film is booming. Really. In spite of the disruption caused by the pandemic to production and release schedules, film productions on the continent have increased by more than 50% over the past decade. Some of these new films will premiere at the Berlin film festival, which opens today, or Cannes and Venice later in the year. Those who don’t manage to get a slot at the “big three” can still hope for red-carpet treatment: the submission platform FilmFreeway records more than 600 new European film festivals for this year alone.</p><p>There is a less shiny flipside to the golden decade of European film, however. Since 2011, the growth in film productions <a href="https://rm.coe.int/analysis-of-european-box-office-structure-2010-2022-december-2023-m-ka/1680ad9268">has not been matched</a> by a similar growth in audiences, meaning fewer moviegoers

<p>RPG Maker was launched in 1992 and has become increasingly complex, but it’s still a remarkably accessible way to make adventure games with no development experience</p><p>It is said that every 100 years, a small fishing village on the southern coast of an unknown fantasy realm holds a magical artisanal cheese festival. As an adventurer and fan of ethically produced dairy products, you are determined to attend the fabled event, arriving at the dock on a small boat with only a few gold coins and a dream. This is the backdrop to the worst role-playing adventure I have ever experienced – and, entirely coincidentally, the only one I have ever designed.</p><p>The game creation package RPG Maker has been around since 1992, the first version launching on the Japanese PC-98 computer.

<p>The USC point guard, self-described introvert and Clairo fan has lifted a dormant program back to relevancy and become one of LA’s brightest sports stars. And she’s still only 19</p><p>It’s a Tuesday night outside of downtown Los Angeles and I’m in a half-empty Galen Center on the University of Southern California campus. The whole place smells like movie-theater popcorn, sticky spilled soda, and, vaguely, sweat. The cheerleaders jumping up and down on the court, attempting to amp up the somewhat sleepy crowd, look like they could pass for middle schoolers. This is, in unmistakable and almost caricatured fashion, a college campus. But there’s a certain player on the floor, with an oversized bulbous bun atop her head, who is sparkling a little differently than everyone around her. She moves so fluidly, gets to her spots on the floor with such ease. It’s, frankly, just so very clear that she is operating in a different echelon than her peers.
