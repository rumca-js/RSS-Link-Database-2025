Also available on PC.\nWith awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian\u2019s RPGs in the first place. However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that\u2019s more familiar than evolutionary, and there\u2019s bear-ly any enemy variety to keep its swords-and-sorcery battles interesting for long. Even if it doesn\u2019t swing for the fences or leave a memorable mark on the genre, though, it\u2019s still perfectly competent with all the tried-and-true stuff I expect, including chaotic combat, leveling systems and a loot progression that lets you build the kind of character you want to play, and meaningful decisions that can have a massive impact on the world. Plus, the whole thing\u2019s surprisingly technically stable compared to its reliably unreliable peers.
