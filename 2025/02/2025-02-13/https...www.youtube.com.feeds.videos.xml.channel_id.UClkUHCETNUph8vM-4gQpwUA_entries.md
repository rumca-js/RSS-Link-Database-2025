Avowed Review - Not Pillars of Eternity, But Pretty Darn Good
In this Avowed Review, I'm going to be talking about my experience having played about 100 hours of this game so far. I had a lot of fun playing it. It was tons of fun. I think the average player will probably get closer to around 80 hours out of it. I explored seeing the different endings and different outcomes of different quests, so I reloaded a lot and also experimented around with a lot of builds and things like that.
