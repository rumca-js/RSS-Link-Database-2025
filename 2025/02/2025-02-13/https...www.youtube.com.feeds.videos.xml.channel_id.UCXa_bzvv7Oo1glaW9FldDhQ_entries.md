Sony’s most recent State of Play showcase wasn’t exactly lacking in big updates and announcements, and yet, for those who were hoping to see a bunch of major first-party stuff, it was a decided disappointment, even if Housemarque’s Saros did look promising. 

In fact, the need for a PlayStation Showcase seems keener than ever now. Between games that Sony has officially announced for which new updates or trailers are long overdue (including those that are due out this year) and those that reports have strongly suggested are going to be unveiled soon, Sony clearly has no shortage of things to talk about. 

So, does that mean the company is planning a PlayStation Showcase event? That’s certainly what we’re hoping for.
