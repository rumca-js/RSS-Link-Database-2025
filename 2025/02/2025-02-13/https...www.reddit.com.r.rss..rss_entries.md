<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been hard at work the past year adding more features to <a href="https://usedigest.com">Digest</a> after getting tons of feedback from this community.</p> <p>We now support hundreds of out of the box RSS feeds, we can pull in any RSS feed URL, and we built native integrations where an RSS feed may not be possible or it was limited. We also now support Google News, Mastodon, Bluesky (soon), X, Reddit, YouTube, Crypto/Stocks, Instagram, TikTok, Google Calendar, any many other sources. Finally, going beyond RSS feeds, we now also have a newsletter reader, so all of your newsletters can be sent right into Digest and read there in one convenient place. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/usedigest"> /u/usedigest </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iohmbl/digest_rss_feeds_newsletter_reader_and_more/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/
