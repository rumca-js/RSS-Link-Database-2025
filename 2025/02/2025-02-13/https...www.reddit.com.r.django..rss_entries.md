About 60 PRs have built up on the GitHub repository, many of which fix crucial issues, but are not getting any feedback and have no path forward to getting them merged. PRs that fix documentation will get merged in a day, but most PRs that touch code are left out to dry. Among these PRs include performance improvements, the validation vs. serialization split, my own fix for aliases, and much more.
