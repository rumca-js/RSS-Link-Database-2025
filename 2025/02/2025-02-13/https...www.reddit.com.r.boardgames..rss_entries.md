<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys! I&#39;ve been looking desperately for a while for a game my ex and I used to play during quarantine, but I cannot find anything remotely close to it and I don&#39;t know the name. </p> <p>I&#39;m pretty sure it just came in a little box or even a pouch because it&#39;s all cards if I&#39;m remembering correctly. You lay out a bunch of rows and columns of cards, with cards of different colors I believe. Like red, yellow, blue, purple etc. Each card has a number on it I think? And you take turns moving your piece to the card you want to take. You start from the top row and make your way down. You can stay in the row and collect cards there as long as you want, but once you move down a row you can&#39;t go back up. You&#39;re trying to get the most points by getting things like the most purple points, for example, using the numbers on the cards. I think you get extra points for being the first one to finish too. That&#39;s the most I remember!

I&#39;ve been a board gamer for many years now, it&#39;s one of the main social activities I engage in and it&#39;s not uncommon for me, my partner, our kiddo, and friends to play board games almost every night of the week.</p> <p>There are many classic games I&#39;d never part with that you probably wouldn&#39;t find surprising, and many games I&#39;ve decided not to keep that you also wouldn&#39;t be shocked by. For instance, saying &quot;I&#39;ll never get rid of Viticulture!&quot; or &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand Munchkin Fu&quot; probably wouldn&#39;t turn any heads, but over the years there&#39;s been a few games I&#39;ve either hung onto longer than I initially expected, or got rid of that I think WILL provide an interesting insight into this player&#39;s mindset.
