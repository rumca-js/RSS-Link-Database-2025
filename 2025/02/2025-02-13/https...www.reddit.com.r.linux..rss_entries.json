I\u2019d like to have a custom distribution that only runs POVRay and maybe ffmpeg as well as my own worker servers.

But I installed and currently use arch linux fine no problem, and running it is basically no different from any of the other &quot;beginner-friendly&quot; distros (ubuntu, mint, stuff like that). The only thing that could be considered hard is the installation process. After that, it&#39;s just `pacman -S &lt;bunchofpackages&gt;` and ur good to go. It seems to me like the entire &quot;i use arch btw&quot; meme is quite overplayed (although I still use it all the time anything to be superior lmao)</p> <p>EDIT: guys pls read the entire fucking post before responding</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lych33je11y\"> /u/lych33je11y </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1io6krr/why_is_arch_linux_considered_so_complicated/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1io6krr/why_is_arch_linux_considered_so_complicated/\">",
