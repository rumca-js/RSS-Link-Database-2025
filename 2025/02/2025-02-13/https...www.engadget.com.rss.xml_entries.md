<p>Google is making Gemini just a bit better. Starting today, the company&#39;s chatbot will <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/feed/gemini-referencing-past-chats/">recall past conversations</a> in an effort to provide more useful responses. &quot;That means no more starting over from scratch or having to search for a previous conversation thread,&quot; Google explains. &quot;Plus, you can build on top of previous conversations or projects you’ve already started.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google notes Gemini &quot;may&quot; indicate if it referenced a past conversation to formulate a response. If the idea of a chatbot recalling information about you makes you feel uncomfortable, Google says users can &quot;easily review, delete or decide how long&quot; Gemini retains their chat history. Additionally, it&#39;s possible to disable this feature altogether from the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://myactivity.google.com/product/gemini">My Activity panel</a>.</p>

<p>Meta’s Oversight Board is coming under new pressure to respond to the company’s recent policy changes on fact-checking and moderation, which were made without input from the advisory group. A coalition of civil society organizations has published an open letter to the Oversight Board saying the group should resign en masse as “recent developments make it clear that the company has abandoned any pretense of oversight and acts with no regard as to the consequences.”</p>
<p>The letter, which was first <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/13/oversight-board-meta-hate-speech-letter/"><ins>reported</ins></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em>, comes from the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.globaltechjustice.org/members"><ins>Global Coalition for Tech Justice</ins></a>, which is made up of more than 250 human and digital rights advocates, fact-checking organizations and other civil society groups from around the world.</p>

This isn’t too surprising, given that the first expansion, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vessel-of-hatred-is-the-latest-reason-to-start-playing-diablo-iv-again-160036459.html"><em>Vessel of Hatred</em></a>, didn’t release until the game had been out for 17 months.</p>
<p>Fergusson announced that Blizzard will drop a 2025 roadmap just ahead of Season 8, but that it won’t include any details on the next major expansion. Additionally, he didn’t say when in 2026 it was likely to drop, nor did he provide any details.</p>

No more than two crew members can work on the car during this process, with a third dedicated to stopping and releasing the car with visual cues to the driver.&nbsp;</p>

In an announcement, YouTube has <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/">revealed</a> that it&#39;s in the middle of negotiations with the company to be able to continue offering its channels. YouTube says it&#39;s &quot;fighting for an agreement that avoids passing along additional costs&quot; to you, which indicates that they can&#39;t agree on a financial deal that works for both of them, as well as one that gives you &quot;more flexibility in how you watch your favorite sports and shows.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry, beefcakes, but this review isn’t for you. All the fighters and rangers out there will still get a sense of how phenomenal <em>Avowed </em>is, the lushness of its environments, the clarity of its combat systems and the depth of its conversation trees — but at its core, this is the review for <em>Avowed </em>players who want to spend their time in the Living Lands learning how to become a master of mushroom-powered magic. This is the <em>Avowed </em>review for wizards. And, sure, all of their friends.</p> 
<p>To be clear, I would happily play <em>Avowed </em>as any mixture of classes, and I’m likely going to boot up a new campaign and do exactly this very soon. But in my first runthrough, I wanted to see if the game would let me live out my fantastical spell-slinging dreams, and it absolutely did.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
