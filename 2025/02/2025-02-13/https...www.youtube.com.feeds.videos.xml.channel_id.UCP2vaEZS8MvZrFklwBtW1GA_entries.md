Bathroom wall painting tips #ad‚Ä¶I always prime bare drywall and like using @kilzbrand KILZ 2 All-Purpose Primer. I roll that on my drywall repair and allow it to cure. Then, I use @magnolia Home by Joanna Gaines Classic Interior Paint in the color Yarn, which is available for purchase on Amazon. I cut into the ceiling with an angled-sash brush, then back roll for a smooth finish. Many thanks to #kilz for helping my client upgrade their bathroom üëçüèΩüî•#everyprojectisworthit
