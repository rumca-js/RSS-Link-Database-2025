That\u2019s a solid 20 percent discount, bringing it down from its original $599 price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because it\u2019s affordable doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. In fact, the Beelink SER8 runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor, a jaw-dropping 24GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. That\u2019s a pretty fantastic configuration, whether you\u2019re doomscrolling the day away, handling work tasks, or streaming movies. And if you want to upgrade, you can easily do so \u2014 it supports up to a whopping 256GB RAM!</",

Use them in conjunction with filters and folders and you\u2019ve got a powerful way to organize incoming messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While email aliases aren\u2019t a new concept, I\u2019ve been leaning into them lately as I experiment with migrating from Gmail to a new email provider. Now I wish I\u2019d been doing it sooner.
