Kraven the Hunter concludes Sony's Spider-man villain universe which included such gems as Morbius and Madame Web. And as you can expect, it's another really bad movie that lost a bunch of money and became a joke on the internet. There is some good this time, but ultimately the writing sucks too much because Sony hired the same writers again as before. And so, one more time, let's see what fundamental writing mistakes Kraven does so that we can learn to avoid them and not to become laughed at by the internet.
