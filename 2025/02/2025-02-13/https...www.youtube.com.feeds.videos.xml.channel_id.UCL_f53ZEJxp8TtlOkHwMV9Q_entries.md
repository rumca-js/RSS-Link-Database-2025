Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with author, ex-professor, and public advocate, Matthew Goodwin. They discuss the systemic rot of the academic institutions, how the West has been subjugated by long-term mass radicalization, why the elites rally behind far-left progressivism, the grotesque extent of UK r*pe gang scandal, and (if not obvious) exactly why we wonâ€™t be quiet about it regardless of what Keir Starmer would prefer.

Matt Goodwin is a disillusioned university professor who stepped away from a tenured position last year to get more involved in politics and the public debate. He has the largest Substack in the UK, presents the TV Show State of the Nation on GB News, is the author of six books, including two national bestsellers, and has many followers on social media in the UK and across Europe.

This episode was filmed on February 6th, 2025.
