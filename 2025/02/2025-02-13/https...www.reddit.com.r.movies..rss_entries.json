I can\u2019t believe what I just watched and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see this earlier considering I\u2019ve seen (nearly) every film David Lynch has made.</p> <p>For starters it\u2019s a good old-fashioned film next to anything that followed. It looks and feels like it\u2019s set in the \u201850s. It looks like Vertigo. It\u2019s a beautiful film. The set design. Just gorgeous to look at.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the evil that lurks underneath that perfect suburban setting. That early shot of the black insects amongst the green grass says it all. The nasty little things that remain hidden are part of the beauty that we do see. They come hand-in-hand. </p> <p>I know a Frank Booth. I have a Frank Booth in my life. He\u2019s a tragic figure. He can\u2019t love but he wants to. But he can\u2019t. So he destroys. He won\u2019t accept nice gestures from",
