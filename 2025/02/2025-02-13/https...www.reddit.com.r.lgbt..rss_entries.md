This little creep hid in my windowsill and sat with his phone videotaping FOR TWO HOURS. He has video/photos of me watching one topic, jammidodger, yukko ex, Alice in wonderland, funkyfrogbait, and a lot more. He has already told two of my other brothers. One would not say anything, and the other I&#39;m not so sure. HE IS PSYCHO. He claims the reason he did this is because I critique his overwatch gameplay to much. WTF!? He has always hated me in particular and he WOULD go through with this! Apparently the only way to keep him from showing my HIGHLY transphobic and homophobic parents is to not talk to him, but he has blackmailed my other siblings for other things too and it NEVER stops at the first demand.
