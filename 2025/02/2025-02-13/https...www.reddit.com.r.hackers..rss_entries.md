<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see plenty of articles and people talking about the major security/cyber risks being exposed bc of how haphazardly DODGE is carrying out their elimination of government programs and protections. Putting the moral implications of that aside….he has children not even able to rent a car, and some can’t legally drink, accessing our information. Reports of downloading that information to external hard drives. Giving IT access to a private citizen who currently runs his own private IT company etc…why are people not alarmed by all of this? Is there anything to be done? Would love to know what folks on this thread think of all this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gratefulanddriven"> /u/Gratefulanddriven </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ioo4rg/dodge_biggest_security_risk_in_nations_history/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/com
