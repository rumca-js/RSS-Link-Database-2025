Like actually almost none, so I&#39;m essencially a beginner in the fantasy genre. And I&#39;ve been wanting to read more, but there&#39;s so many famous and acclaimed authors that I didn&#39;t know where to start.</p> <p>Do y&#39;all have any recommendations for a beginner in the genre? It doesn&#39;t need to be similar to LOTR, I am open to different stories and worlds.

It&#39;s about a street kid who steals stuff for his abusive master and is sent to a magic school after being caught interrupting a robbery. I like the concept of this book and would love some more books with a similar premise.</p> <p>The main things I liked about this book:</p> <ul> <li>The MC using the skills he learned on the street even after being sent to school.</li> <li>The magic school setting. This might be too specific so I&#39;ll take anything where the MC is put in a situation where they have to integrate back into society and socialize on a daily basis.</li> <li>The MC having trauma and trust issues after being raised by an abuser.</li> <li>The lack of romance</li> </ul> <p>Huge bonus if the main character is male.

I think she was painting. </p> <p>Nearby some noble guy was showing of doing something with some flower petals. Possibly shooting them with magic. While a crowd was watching.</p> <p>I think she thought to herself she definitely wasnt there to take a peek at him or anything.</p> <p>I have this strong color impression in my memory so I feel like colorful magic was involved somehow.</p> <p>This would probably be very early in the book.</p> <p>It&#39;s not a lot to go by, I know...but on the off chance someone recognized this Id be very grateful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

It embodied all the classic fantasy tropes and storytelling that I truly miss in modern works, and it was honestly just a fun book with lovable characters. And some great world-building with politics between two worlds/countries. The weird thing about Magician though is that it kind of ends\u2026 It doesn\u2019t feel like the first book in a trilogy at all\u2013much more like just a great standalone.

It almost feels like two books.</p> <ol> <li>For the first half or so, it feels far more like a spinoff of Magician than a proper sequel. (It focuses on Arutha and Jimmy the Hand mostly) The quest is very \u201cclassic\u201d in its feel, but the events seem almost disconnected from the conflict in Magician. Despite this, it still w",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>After (barely) finishing Brandon Sanderson\u2019s Wind &amp; Truth, I decided to re-start Tad Williams Osten Ard series from the beginning now that the final volumes are out. And re-reading The Dragonbone Chair reminded me of something: that I mostly prefer the first volumes of fantasy epics. People generally seem to rate the latter volumes of fantasy series higher, because that\u2019s where all the payoff is. But I prefer the slow build-up of early volumes. If push came to shove, I\u2019d name my favourite fantasy novels as Dragonbone Chair, Eye Of The World, and Pawn Of Prophecy.</p> <p>The first third of Dragonbone Chair is notoriously slow, but that\u2019s only a problem if you\u2019re impatient to get to some action. It\u2019s poetically written and packed with detail, with a lovely cosy feel. Reading about Simon exploring the castle, meeting all his friends and foes, learning about the backstory in a relaxed way, means that I feel more of loss when it\u2019s threatened. Same thi",

My favourites are Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, and F Scott Fitzgerald. I also read and enjoyed Jorge Luis Borges. As for fantasy books I liked Tolkien, Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Tanith Lee, and Octavia Butler. For contemporary fantasy I\u2019d say my favourites are Joe Abercrombie and RF Kuang. I detest Sanderson to just get that out of the way. That said I\u2019m craving more experimental and stylistic prose in contemporary fantasy books since I\u2019m running out of classics to read. I finished Alice in wonderland just recently and I thought it was wonderful. Though I disliked Harry Potter quite intensely. I\u2019m looking to discover some new recs.

I mentioned to someone that my issue with Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and why I didn&#39;t like it as much as other people did is because of how dark and pessimistic it felt. Seriously, all your party members seem to hate each other and most areas you go to are either something out of a Lovecraft story or full of demons and cannibalistic goblins or whatever. I was ROASTED for saying that, saying I&#39;m not a real gamer and I should just play Roblox or something. When I tried to watch House of the Dragon I found myself laughing hysterically at how over the top the first episode was with its intense gore and sex.
