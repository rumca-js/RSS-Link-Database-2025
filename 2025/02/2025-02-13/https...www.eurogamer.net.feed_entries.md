This beautiful, open-ended role-playing game is gorgeous, it runs smoothly on PC and Xbox alike and it leverages Unreal Engine 5's latest features almost without fault. Anyone familiar with Obsidian Entertainment's storied history would know that its track record for technical polish isn't exactly sterling, so it's an unexpected triumph - one of the best showcases of a modern Unreal Engine 5 title that uses the engine's best features while avoiding its biggest pitfalls. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-avowed-is-obsidians-technical-triumph-despite-the-typical-heft-of-ue5">Read more</a></p>

Oh my goodness, this game is one hot piece of variety packed goodness, from its environments, its gameplay, its abilities and even its camera angles. Actually, I am sitting here trying to remember every different thing I experienced during my hands-on preview with Split Fiction, and you know what, I don't think I can just off the top of my head. There was <em>so </em>much packed into the three hours I got to play, and the result was an absolute hoot that kept me on my toes throughout.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-riot-and-its-use-o
