Researchers at UCLA’s RoMeLa lab have developed SPLITTER, a robotic system designed for planetary exploration through tethered jumping. The system consists of two quadrupedal robots connected by a tether, allowing efficient movement in low-gravity environments like the Moon and asteroids. Unlike traditional rovers, SPLITTER’s design enables stable mid-air travel without thrusters. The robot’s motion is controlled using an inertial morphing mechanism based on the Tennis Racket Theorem. The team aims to enhance SPLITTER’s capabilities through improved hardware and simulations for future space missions.

Apple is exploring robots to add to its future smart home ecosystem, according to TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The Cupertino-based tech giant is said to be looking at both humanoid and non-humanoid form factors. The roadmap is currently said to have reached the proof-of-concept stage, and mass production is unlikely to begin before 2028. However, it appears that the iPhone maker is seriously considering entering the robotics space, and looks at it as a sensor-based software-focused technology.

Seismic activity at Mount Spurr, Alaska, has intensified over the past ten months, with recent earthquakes shifting towards Crater Peak, a vent that erupted in 1992 and 1953. Scientists estimate a 50 percent chance of an eruption at Crater Peak, though the main crater remains stable. If an eruption occurs, ashfall and air travel disruptions could be significant, similar to the 1992 event that temporarily shut down Anchorage’s airport. The Alaska Volcano Observatory continues to monitor the situation closely for signs of imminent activity.

The universe's large-scale uniformity is under scrutiny through weak gravitational lensing. Researchers are analysing data from the Euclid Space Telescope to detect potential anisotropies in cosmic expansion. If confirmed, these findings could challenge the fundamental Cosmological Principle, which assumes the universe has no preferred direction. This study suggests that deviations in lensing signals might indicate a more complex structure than previously thought, potentially requiring revisions to the Standard Model of Cosmology. Future observations will be key in determining whether these anomalies reflect real cosmic phenomena.
