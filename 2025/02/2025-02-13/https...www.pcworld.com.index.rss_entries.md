<p>After a weird not-quite-announcement at CES 2025, AMD is ready to whip back the curtain on its next generation of graphics card. Today, David McAfee (VP of Ryzen and Radeon) <a href="https://x.com/McAfeeDavid_AMD/status/1890102891119276284">announced on X</a> that the company will formally unveil the Radeon RX 9070 XT on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Gaming-AMD">AMD Gaming YouTube channel</a> on February 28 at 8 AM Eastern.</p>



<p>AMD originally <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568373/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-rdna-4-embrace-the-ai-revolution.html">briefed the press on the Radeon RX 9070 XT</a> in early January, saying that it would be part of the company’s CES 2025 keynote. AMD never actually mentioned a new GPU generation, and in interviews afterwards, executives said it was delayed to provide a bigger, dedicated event for its complex n

<p>eBay is running some killer deals right now with unbeatable prices on refurbished laptops, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2603948/whoa-get-this-asus-chromebook-with-8gb-ram-for-just-109.html">this Chromebook for just over a hundred bucks</a>. But if you prefer Windows, you can get an equally amazing deal from Acer, whose official eBay account is selling an AMD-powered touchscreen laptop with 16GB of RAM <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266889342994">for just $271.99</a>.</p>



<p>The Acer Aspire 3 offers a 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen, a mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 7520U quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM (which is as low as I would go for Windows 11 these days), and a roomy 1TB SSD. Those specs are hard to find on <em>any</em> Windows laptop under $500 right now, but Acer is selling a refurbished one for $339.99 — and with a 20 percent discount wi

<p>Never fear the dreaded low-battery beep. This itsy bitsy Anker Nano power bank will keep your phone charged anywhere you go, and right now you can snag it for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Foldable-Connector-Portable-Charger/dp/B0C6XK77HJ/">only $18.98 on Amazon</a>. That’s a solid 37 percent discount off its $30 MSRP. (Clip the on-page coupon!)</p>



<p>This ultra-portable power bank is so tiny, even us ladies can slip it into our barely-there pockets. I know this from personal experience because I bought one during concert season last year — and I was able to take it with me everywhere and keep my phone charged day and night.</p>



<p>The 5,000mAh capacity is enough to charge your phone from dead to full, which is more than enough for a day’s outing. It also has a built-in USB-C connector that folds when not in use. Want to charge a second devi

<p>People are excited for AMD’s newest graphics cards, if only because they’re desperate for an alternative to Nvidia’s ever-increasing prices. But the Radeon range was snubbed in AMD’s CES 2025 keynote and only got <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568373/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-rdna-4-embrace-the-ai-revolution.html">a brief preview at the show</a>, even though the RX 9070 and 9070 XT have been confirmed for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2583773/amd-says-radeon-9070-gpus-coming-in-march.html">sometime next month</a>. Today, we might finally have a glimpse at some hard specs.</p>



<p>A GPU-Z screenshot showing all the juicy details under the hood of the 9070 XT was posted to Twitter (un-formerly X) by <a href="https://x.com/hkepcmedia/status/1889994288836280652">HKEPC Media</a>. While this is something that could easily be faked, they’ve

<p>When will you be able to buy a new Nvidia graphics card? Hell if I know, the retailers <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2596318/new-rtx-5090s-could-take-3-to-16-weeks-to-arrive.html">seem to be pretty clueless themselves</a>. But if you’re asking when, specifically, you might get a <em>chance</em> to get your hands on the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti? The answer is “next Thursday.”</p>



<p>Nvidia confirmed the release date in <a href="https://x.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1890038221314077048">a new social media post</a>, which follows up a few initial leaks <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2605019/one-retailer-hints-that-rtx-5070-ti-cards-are-coming-next-week.html">indicating the same thing</a>.

<p>One of the appeals of a centralized platform like the App Store, Google Play Store, or Steam is that you can generally rely upon the maintainer to keep harmful stuff out so you can download software with confidence. At least, that’s the idea. But every once in a while it doesn’t work out — like when a free-to-play game gets through Steam’s various safeguards and delivers malware to unsuspecting players.</p>



<p>That’s what happened with <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250208024134/https://store.steampowered.com/app/3476470/PirateFi/">PirateFi</a></em> (that’s an archive.org link), which hit the Steam store a week ago with some stolen screenshots. It was available for a few days before Valve found out it was delivering “suspected malware” to downloadeders. Valve pulled the game and banhammered the developer, but at least a few players appear to

<p>Unless you review gaming headsets for a living, it can be tricky to tell the best-sounding ones from those that are just okay. That’s especially the case with gaming headsets in the midrange-to-premium tier, which generally all have high setpoints for audio fidelity.</p>



<p>Naturally, you want the best-sounding headset there is for your money, not the second best, so here are a few tips to tell the wheat from the slightly lesser-quality wheat (so to speak).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="are-there-any-unwanted-defects">Are there any unwanted defects?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you shouldn’t hear any strange sounds in your earcups, like pops, crackles, or static. These indicate the presence of unwanted defects in the audio stream.</p>

<p>These days, you can get pretty powerful computers for cheap. They’re called mini PCs and they’re a great option when you want daily driver performance without needing a full-blown gaming rig.</p>



<p>Right now, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Computer-Desktop-Display-2-5Gbps/dp/B0DJVRSQP7/">Beelink SER8 mini PC is only $479 on Amazon</a>, the best price we’ve seen for it. That’s a solid 20 percent discount, bringing it down from its original $599 price.</p>



<p>Just because it’s affordable doesn’t mean it’s bad. In fact, the Beelink SER8 runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor, a jaw-dropping 24GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD. That’s a pretty fantastic configuration, whether you’re doomscrolling the day away, handling work tasks, or streaming movies. And if you want to upgrade, you can easily do so — it supports up to a whopping 256GB RAM!</

<p>Intel’s new Core Ultra 200 processors offer a huge leap forward in performance on top of all-day battery life. They’re a huge improvement over their predecessors. But these new “Arrow Lake” chips leave out an absolute necessity of today’s PCs: an NPU, the engine which powers AI performance across the board.</p>



<p>We knew this going into my <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2592394/intels-new-laptops-cpus-last-forever-but-i-didnt-expect-the-performance-leap.html">review of Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285H</a> inside of an MSI laptop. But it might be time for Intel — and maybe AMD, too — to take a step back and consider what consumers really want: a “good,” one-size-fits-all mainstream PC. And a clear way to identify them!</p>

<p>With so much to watch across so many streaming services, it’s entirely too easy to lose track of everything.</p>



<p>That’s where an app called <a href="https://trakt.tv">Trakt</a> comes in. Trakt can tell you where to watch pretty much any streaming show or movie, but it can also remember how much of a series you’ve watched and keep you in the loop on new episodes.</p>



<p>While Trakt has been around since 2010, it recently added a way to automatically track what you’re watching across a half-dozen major streaming services. It’s a key differentiator from other streaming guide apps, such as Reelgood and JustWatch, whose show-tracking features require you to manage your watch history manually. The feature is part of <a href="https://trakt.tv/vip">Trakt’s VIP subscription</a>, which costs $6 per month or $60 per year.</p>

<p>From the department of Things I Should Have Done Sooner, I have finally discovered the magic of email aliases.</p>



<p>Aliases are kind of like alternative email addresses, except when email is sent to an alias, it still arrives in your main inbox. Use them in conjunction with filters and folders and you’ve got a powerful way to organize incoming messages.</p>



<p>While email aliases aren’t a new concept, I’ve been leaning into them lately as I experiment with migrating from Gmail to a new email provider. Now I wish I’d been doing it sooner. Here’s why.</p>
