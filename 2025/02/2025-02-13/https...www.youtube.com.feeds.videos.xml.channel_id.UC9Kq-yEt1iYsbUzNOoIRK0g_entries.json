        "description": "Step inside the pitch meeting that led to Love Hurts!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Kq-yEt1iYsbUzNOoIRK0g\n\nKe Huy Quan is going through a well-deserved career revival after his amazing Oscar-winning performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once - and now he\u2019s a leading man in a never-before-seen genre where a mild-mannered guy is actually very good at fighting! Oh wait there have been a bunch of those movies? Oh well we still like Ke!\n\nLove Hurts definitely raises some questions. Like why did this former assassin pick a new career that is super public-facing? Why did Rose choose Valentine\u2019s Day to suddenly return? Why are only the innocent characters being brutally taken out? Who is Ariana DeBose\u2019s agent and why do they hate her?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George\u2019s Pitch Meeting for Love Hurts!\n\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nKraven The Hunter Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQOYgKePQK0\n\nBest Pi",
