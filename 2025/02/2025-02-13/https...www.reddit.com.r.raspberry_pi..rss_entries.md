<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I left my pi 4B in my closet for a while when I didnt need it. After 2 weeks I took it out, turned it on but it gives out no display. my monitor detects the hdmi because when I take it out of the pi, then my monitor says &quot;check display connection&quot;. The red light comes on but the green light seemingly flashes at random. When I plug power in, then the green light flashes for a split second, then sometimes it flashes 2 times and then goes off and sometimes when I push the hdmi cord in then the green light also comes on.</p> <p>I have tried using 2 monitors, 2 sd cards, the 64-bit version, the 32-bit version, the 64-bit legacy version and 2 different power cables and bricks.</p> <p>Please help, I cant buy a new one right now</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Even-Combination-394"> /u/Even-Combination-394 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ioqgod/raspberr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m in the early planning stages of a custom in-vehicle infotainment/diagnostics system for my old HiAce. I haven&#39;t picked a board yet, and I’m looking for feedback and ideas on which solution might best meet my specs. Here are the key requirements I have in mind:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dual Display Support:</strong><br/> I’d like to drive two monitors (one primary touchscreen for navigation and media control, and a secondary display for additional content like movies) with a switchable interface.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Sensor &amp; Peripheral Integration:</strong> </p> <ul> <li>A GPS interface (via UART/I²C)<br/></li> <li>A camera input (MIPI‑CSI or USB)<br/></li> <li>Temperature sensors for both interior and exterior readings<br/></li> <li>Audio input/output (for connecting a microphone and linking to the car&#39;s sound system for voice control)</li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>Local Media &amp; Connectivity:</strong> <
