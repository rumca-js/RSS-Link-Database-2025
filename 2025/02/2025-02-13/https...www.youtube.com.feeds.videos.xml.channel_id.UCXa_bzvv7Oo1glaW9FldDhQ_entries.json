        "description": "Sony\u2019s most recent State of Play showcase wasn\u2019t exactly lacking in big updates and announcements, and yet, for those who were hoping to see a bunch of major first-party stuff, it was a decided disappointment, even if Housemarque\u2019s Saros did look promising. \n\nIn fact, the need for a PlayStation Showcase seems keener than ever now. Between games that Sony has officially announced for which new updates or trailers are long overdue (including those that are due out this year) and those that reports have strongly suggested are going to be unveiled soon, Sony clearly has no shortage of things to talk about. \n\nSo, does that mean the company is planning a PlayStation Showcase event? That\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re hoping for.",

        "description": "This generation of consoles has seen its fair share of landmark RPGs over the years, which means hopes are high for yet another fantasy action RPG, Avowed. The game is shaping up to be another notch entry in the genre. Plenty has been shown and said of the title in the lead up to its release, a lot of which we\u2019ve covered across multiple features, but there\u2019s plenty still that we haven\u2019t yet discussed. \n\nAs such, with Avowed reviews already out, here, we are going to take a look at a few more key details that you should know about the game, from its combat and exploration to its accessibility features, progression mechanics, and more.",
