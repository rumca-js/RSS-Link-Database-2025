I have an API setup in python with uvicorn and an AI RAG pipeline, and it&#39;s currently hosted on Oracle with the free tier of 4 vCPU&#39;s and 24 GB RAM. I use Mistral-7B and save embeddings inside of a pkl file hosted within the container, and it works but it&#39;s incredibly slow. I was considering building a GPU-based server, but I&#39;m not sure if that would need a lot of VRAM vs. RAM and whether it would support multiple requests at the same time. Are there any inexpensive places that offer GPU-supported cloud hosting? It takes about 3-4 minutes to generate a response for one request in my current application, and I hopefully want to cut it down to sub-30 sec.

I am dockerizing a large legacy Django app that has a number of background Django commands it runs. One such command is a \u201cdata binning\u201d service that creates rolling bins. It\u2019s currently a well constructed Django command but it runs as a supervisor subtask in our current monolith deployment. How do I correctly dockerize something like this that needs access to both the main Django container and a DB? It needs the models from Django and writes to my DB. Just wondering what best practice here would be? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tking13\"> /u/tking13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iod1gd/best_practice_for_background_tasks/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iod1gd/best_practice_for_ba",
