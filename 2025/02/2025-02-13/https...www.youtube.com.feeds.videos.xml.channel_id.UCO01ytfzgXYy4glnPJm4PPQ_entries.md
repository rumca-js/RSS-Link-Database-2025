Today on the Matt Walsh Show, trans activists descended on a city council meeting in Massachusetts. When I show you the footage from this thing, you will have a hard time believing that it isn’t satire. Also, a “mentorship” program for “LGBT youth” is set to receive over a million dollars in tax funding. But what does this “mentorship” consist of? We’ll find out. A reparations bill has been reintroduced. Congresswoman Ayanna Presley says reparations are owed because slaves built our country. Is that actually true? And what exactly is a “work husband” or “work wife” and why are they now selling Valentine’s Day cards for them? And Pope Francis has issued a letter condemning Trump's immigration policies. As a Catholic, I don’t especially enjoy calling the pope out, but if I need to, I will. And today, I need to.
