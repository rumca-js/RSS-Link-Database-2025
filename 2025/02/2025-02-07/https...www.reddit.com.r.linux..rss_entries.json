The PC on the other hand on Arch would not go into sleep mode and would stay on then with Nobara it would try to sleep but then turn back on as well. If I try to click sleep in the app launcher it tries but cannot successfully sleep either on Nobara.

On the other, there is a clarification that the project isnt going anywhere and what the current roadmap looks like.</p> <p>It seems that they are looking to clarify roles and formally expand the team to split / share workload and want to make the developer experience more pleasurable as part of their effort to be more welcoming to new users.</p> <p>The expansion of the repo in specific cases such as them now looking to package up Plasma I think will be quite welcomed.</p> <p>It does seem they have a lot of interesting ideas and goals of what they want to achieve.

I have multiple programs for looking at and editing text and yet xml NEEDS to be opened in a browser where I can&#39;t even edit it??? Then it asks you &quot;hey wanna set me as the default \ud83e\udd13&quot; as if it didn&#39;t already replace firefox everywhere it was a default. I just wanna install chromium and not dig through settings to make it not be extremely stupid. this actually pisses me off so fucking much.
