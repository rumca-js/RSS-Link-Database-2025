Hulu is also bringing in two very different movies: <em>In the Summers</em>, a drama about two sisters and their differing relationships with their difficult father, and <em>Kill</em>, a tremendously violent revenge thriller set on a train. Rounding all of this off are a few new movies available to rent, incl

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you just started a TV show made in the last five years, there’s a good chance whatever you saw in episode 1 is going to be critically important to the finale. After all, how could it not be — the season only has six, or maybe eight or 10, episodes in total. The problem is, when every moment of a show is critical to its overall plot, the less we actually get to understand about the characters as people.
