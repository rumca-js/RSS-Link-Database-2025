<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ve been doing all of the reading and research and I think I&#39;ve finally decided on my plan of action but would greatly appreciate any insights from those with more experience. I&#39;m located in Asia if it matters. Thanks in advance for your time.</p> <p>My current system is working fine with torrents and my automation is in place. Obviously there are some things that are great and other that are just not available or are not reliable. To this end I want to transition towards Usenet to fill in those gaps.</p> <p>Providers I plan to subscribe to:</p> <p>NewsHosting (high winds)</p> <p>Frugal + block news (netnews + ???) frugal has stated the new bonus server is on a different backbone than netnews and is no longer on farm but can not disclose where it is located due to agreements they have with the backbone to not disclose.</p> <p>I assume these two should cover most things and then if I needed more I could look at adding a block account
