So that&#39;s why it looks this way.</p> <p>I am not very tech-savvy, so I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m talking about. What I do know is that my PC is super slow when it shouldn&#39;t be. </p> <p>Issue: When I check the task manager, the &quot;disk&quot; idles at 100%. I don&#39;t even know what the &quot;disk&quot; is, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the hard drive. </p> <p>I pirate Wii games every now and then, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what caused it. The anti-malware that comes with Windows 11 did find a Trojan after I played a Doom mod, but for all I know it could have been there for a while. </p> <p>I upgraded to Windows 11 about a year ago but rolled it back after the issue got really bad. Rolling back didn&#39;t seem to do anything which makes me wonder if it&#39;s just my hard drive dying on me and if I need an SSD or some",
