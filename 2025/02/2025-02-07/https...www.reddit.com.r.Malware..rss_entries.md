<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was watching a YouTube video over some ransomware as a service group and it was said that the group made a program that then created another executable that was the malicious payload. </p> <p>How was this done? How is it possible to make a program that makes another program that also has differences depending on input. </p> <p>I can easily make a program that just drops another executable but how is the executable itself made if itâ€™s different depending on input. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/i_hate_email_signup"> /u/i_hate_email_signup </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ijmbfz/how_do_hacker_who_offer_services_make_executables/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ijmbfz/how_do_hacker_who_offer_services_make_executables/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve unsuccessfully tried separating this unhelpful wall of text to make this a little bit more readable. So that&#39;s why it looks this way.</p> <p>I am not very tech-savvy, so I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m talking about. What I do know is that my PC is super slow when it shouldn&#39;t be. </p> <p>Issue: When I check the task manager, the &quot;disk&quot; idles at 100%. I don&#39;t even know what the &quot;disk&quot; is, but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the hard drive. </p> <p>I pirate Wii games every now and then, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what caused it. The anti-malware that comes with Windows 11 did find a Trojan after I played a Doom mod, but for all I know it could have been there for a while. </p> <p>I upgraded to Windows 11 about a year ago but rolled it back after the issue got really bad. Rolling back didn&#39;t seem to do anything which makes me wonder if it&#39;s just my hard drive dying on me and if I need an SSD or some
