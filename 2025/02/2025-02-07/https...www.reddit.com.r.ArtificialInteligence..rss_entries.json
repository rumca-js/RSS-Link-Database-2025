Instead of requiring massive datasets and extensive computing power, S1 was trained using just 1,000 carefully selected examples on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for only 26 minutes, costing around $6 per run.</p> <p>One of S1\u2019s key innovations is its scalable inference technique, which allows the model to &quot;think&quot; longer when necessary by using a simple command substitution. This technique enhances accuracy while keeping computational demands low.</p> <p>S1 demonstrates that cutting-edge AI doesn\u2019t have to be prohibitively expensive, opening new doors for researchers and developers with limited resources.
