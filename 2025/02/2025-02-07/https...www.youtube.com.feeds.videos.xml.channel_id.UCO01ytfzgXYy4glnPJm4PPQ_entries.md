Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a Democrat politician announces that she has sterilized herself to avoid getting pregnant in Donald Trump's America. She had to do this, I guess, because of the imaginary law Donald Trump just passed requiring all women to get pregnant. Also, one of the staffers working for DOGE goes by the name “Big Balls.” And now, CNN is on the case. They're on the Big Balls beat, and tracking everything that Big Balls does. And, a trans-identified male actor was on the verge of making history by winning the Best Actress award at the Oscars. But now his dreams are crashing down after some old tweets have come to light.
