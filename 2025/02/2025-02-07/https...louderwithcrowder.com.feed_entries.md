<p>According to the UN, potential funding cuts mean that six million people are now at risk of death. However, it‚Äôs unclear where the evidence is to suggest that funding these people did much of anything to solve the problem but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">UN says that if we stop giving billions of our tax dollars to Africa via USAID, 6.3 million patients with AIDS will die <a href="https://t.co/jCYC041VLK">pic.twitter.com/jCYC041VLK</a><br/>‚Äî End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) <a href="https://twitter.com/EndWokeness/status/1887913213028864192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.j

And to make matters worse, those funds were reportedly used to resettle 3,600 migrants.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">BREAKING: It has been uncovered that Bishop Mariann Budde's Episcopal Migration Ministries (EMM) collected $53 million from Govt programs in 2023 for "Immigrant Resettlement".<br/><br/>So Trump is actually hurting her business.

Let's start Super Bowl weekend off with a laugh. This video of Katt Williams cooking a heckler like he's street corn is going viral. For the comedy of it, yes. But also patriotic elements of Williams singing the national anthem and starting a USA chant. I believe this is what the kids call BASED!</p><p>Usual viral video disclaimers apply. I'm not sure when this video was taken. We only know it's in Phoenix because Katt says so. It is also unclear what the Mexican gentleman said to prior to someone on the other side of stage remembering to do it for content and take their smartphone out. We'll pick things up at the start of the debate over American immigration policy.</p><p>BTW, obviously, this is NSFW.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Katt Williams c
