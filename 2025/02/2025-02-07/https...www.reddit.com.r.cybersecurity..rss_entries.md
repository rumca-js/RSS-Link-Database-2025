<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I know this is a dumb question but I might ask anyway. I unfortunately am a consultant in cyber security which I happen to have started in it not knowing that it’s an absolute death to my career. I know there are people that are so good at being consultants but starting your career with one, from my experience, was not a good idea. I gain experience in everything and nothing at once - again I know this is my personal experience and some others but it does not apply to all. Unfortunately the mere fact of stating I’m a consultant in interviews is like triggering a smear campaign on myself 🥹 Now my question is about soc analyst L1 roles, could it be a good entry point to more tech-y and hands on roles or should I only be looking for L2/L3. I know that soc analysis is seen as extremely boring but I’d take this over another day in consulting. Please do tell me from your experience. Again it’s a personal experience and there are people that do well but
