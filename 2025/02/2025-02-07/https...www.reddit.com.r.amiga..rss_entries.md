## Honestly forgot I have this game and I really felt like giving it a go. Any fans here ? I think it is a wonderful game.

## A500 problems, Gotek works fine, floppy drive/s fail

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to get my old A500 working with mixed success, initially it worked ok with a couple of discs using the original floppy drive, then stopped loading anything and I assumed the floppy drive was faulty.</p> <p>I swapped in another floppy drive from a faulty A500, so wasn&#39;t sure if that floppy worked or not, it didn&#39;t.</p> <p>I installed a Gotek and this works perfectly, running everything ok, I&#39;ve run the test kit tests and all shows ok. I&#39;m not able to run checks on any of the floppy drives as I need the Gotek installed to boot up the test kit, </p> <p>So it works, great!, but I want to check my old floppy discs as well so I bought a &#39;working&#39; 2nd hand floppy drive from ebay (From what appears to be a reliable Amiga parts seller) but this doesn&#39;t work.</p> <p>Every disc I try very quickly shows a read error, this is including the discs I tried that worked when the original floppy worked for a short time.<
