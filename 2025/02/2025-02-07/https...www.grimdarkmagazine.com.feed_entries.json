        "description": "<p>There\u2019s a new drug in Low Town, and it\u2019s creating horrors. After witnessing the all-too-familiar results of it, The Warden investigates in book three of the Low Town trilogy, She Who Waits. All the while his relationship with his best friend Adolphus continues to strain, heading towards a secret that could end twenty years of friendship, of war survival, of relying on each other in their own ways, and of brotherhood for better or worse. Wren has also breached the cusp of manhood, his powers growing and the risk to his freedom and safety with it. The end has arrived for our antiheroes, and it\u2019s all going to fall apart. The Warden has gone up against many things: the Black House, the Association, gangs, and nobles \u2026 and this time it\u2019s the very worst of Rigus: the religious zealots of the Steps. Key to She Who Waits&#8211;and The Warden&#8217;s humanity&#8211;is The Warden\u2019s relationship with Wren, his adopted son. The son wants to stop being treated like a boy, like any 18-year old ",

Drenched in Scottish folklore and mythology, this dark, emotional and mystical high seas fantasy adventure will strike you with equal parts awe and terror. \u201cThe lapping of the waves on the sand filled her ears like a promise. The sea still called her; maybe it always would. But there was no running now. No ignoring what she had to do.\u201d If there is one thing I adore in my stories, it\u2019s wayward women bucking against society\u2019s expectations and trying to find their own place in the world. So, colour me not surprised when I immediately fell head over heels in love with Isla Blackwood. After spending the last seven years at sea searching for her calling, she is reluctantly drawn back to the Blackwood Estate by a mysterious letter from her dying mother. But upon arrival she finds ",
