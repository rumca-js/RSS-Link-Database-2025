For the most part, I\u2019ve loved it, while still loving my PSVR2.

This has me thinking that maybe now is an obviously bad time to spend and invest in this headset and ecosystem. I can still return the headset and get my money back, which I think is possibly the smart thing to do, especially since keeping it would mean I need to buy games in the ecosystem. I don\u2019t have a PC, so I can\u2019t use the headset any other way.</p> <p>So, for the folks th",
