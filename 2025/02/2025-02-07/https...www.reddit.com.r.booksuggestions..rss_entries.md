Personally, I appreciate if something has romance, but it doesn’t have to be strictly that.

I also liked Call Me By Your Name a while back, but the age gap sort of got me. </p> <p>I’ll also say I like an easy-enough read, and usually I go for newer works over older ones.

Also tried to read the CMBYN sequel Find Me, also couldn’t connect with it in the same way I did CMBYN.

He also loves books with humor, so anything with a strong sense of wit or satire is a plus!</p> <p>He has kind of moved on from kid books and on to adult books, but for a while would only read graphic novels and then went through a year or so when he just wouldn’t read at all. </p> <p>Very recently he absolutely loved Zero Stars, Do Not Recommend, which has a good mix of action and satire, It has some adult themes but isn’t overly graphic, gory or overtly focused on sex. </p> <p>He also liked Ready Player One (though didn’t read the sequel for some reason.)

Her storyline is tragic, yet hopeful, with plenty of ups and downs. She doesn’t mind getting her hands dirty if she has to, and can solve almost any problem you throw at her.

I would also like if it was LGB but not marketed as &quot;queer&quot; if that makes sense.</p> <p>I just need something exciting! I don&#39;t mind if the culture isn&#39;t rooted in Africa of the Middle East. It&#39;s just every fantasy book I&#39;ve read for the past 3 books have had a blonde haired blue eyes MC.</p> <p>(ik ik Rin/Altan were brown)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Philosophy_Thick"> /u/Philosophy_Thick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ijhsx2/any_books_like_the_poppy_war_but_with_blackbrown/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ijhsx2/any_books_like_the_poppy_war_but_with_blackbrown

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I am a literature professor, and I was recently asked to be the faculty advisor for the newly formed student book club at my college. </p> <p>I’m trying to help the club president (a student) come up with a few book options for our first group read. The president plans to let the group pick the book during our first meeting, and we will request funding to purchase copies for the club members. </p> <p>There are already a lot of people interested in the club, so we want to find some selections that might speak to a large range of preferences and interests! </p> <p>Preferably literary fiction. Maybe a short story anthology? No romance. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/New-Falcon-9850"> /u/New-Falcon-9850 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ijhsct/college_student_book_club/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
