<p>The Trump administration has ordered states to stop a program to build fast EV chargers on highways throughout the country, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/resources/state-plan-approval-suspension.pdf"><ins>according to a memo</ins></a> released by the Federal Highway Administration. The letter informs state transportation directors, who are in charge of instituting the program, that any plans approved by the Biden administration are now suspended “until new guidance is issued.”</p>
<p>The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program was approved by Congress as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It was intended to fill gaps in America’s EV charging network and was supported by $5 billion in grants. President Trump has long decried the program and regularly <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/08/trump-misleads-on-the-cost-of-electric-vehicle-chargers/"><ins>lied about the specifics</ins></a>

However, if you don't care so much about football (or Super Bowl commercials) and just want a quality TV at a reasonable price, there are still a number of discounts worth checking out.
