After years of screaming &#8220;save the children&#8221; while baselessly accusing others of exploiting kids, the Trump administration is now trying to destroy the actual infrastructure that saves children. This one crosses from standard MAGA hypocrisy into genuinely evil territory. I’m one of those people who doesn’t think you can (or should) call most people inherently [&#8230;]
