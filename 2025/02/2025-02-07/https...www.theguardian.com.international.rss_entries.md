<p>An awkward cross between insipid romantic comedy and schlocky sleepover horror fails on both counts</p><p>After Scream revitalised both the slasher and the horror genre at large back in 1996, the inevitable flood of junkier imitators arrived, less interested in reinventing the wheel and more in keeping the engine running. Quick to write and cheap to make, films like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, Cherry Falls and Valentine trotted out slightly different variations on the same formula (masked killer, WB channel teens) until the films became dumber than the ones Scream had been targeting in the first place.</p><p>It tracks then that after a Ghostface reboot, with 2022’s surprisingly successful fifth instalment, the same would happen once again. Heart Eyes, a film that boasts the same production company and one of its stars, is exactly what an exec would give an easy greenlight to, an easily sellable “if you liked” knock-off.

Another essential phrase has come into the French game in that time, one borrowed from the English, who are, amusingly, almost entirely oblivious to its significance: “Sorry, good game.”</p><p>This phrase, or something like it, is what the English captain Vince Cartwright said to the French players after they went down 35-8 in the first fixture at the Parc des Princes in Paris in 1906. “Sorry, good game,” or something like it, is what Ian Preece repeated after he had kicked the winning drop goal in an 8-3 victory in 1949, when France were on a run of 43 ye

<p>Pairing wine with spicy food is easy to get wrong. Fruit-forward reds and off-dry whites are the way forward</p><p>One reason many shy away from pairing wine with spicy food is that it’s so, <em>so</em> easy to get it wrong. There are several constituent parts in a wine that unfavourably accentuate the heat of a dish: for example, spice can increase our perception of alcohol, causing an unpleasant burn, intense acidity and astringent bitterness. This stifles the fruit and smothers the complexities of the dish, too.</p><p>It’s not a gastronomic question that’s easily answered with a catchy maxim, either. Chilli heat fills the mouth in a different way from the sting of wasabi, say, which is itself different from Sichuan pepper and fresh ginger. But it can be done, should you wish to have a glass of wine with your spicy meal rather than a beer, fruity cocktail or lassi.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/07/are-there-any-wines-that-match-with-spice-hannah-crosbie"

<p>The Spurs and Cavaliers got better, but only one team pulled off a trade so unbelievable the whole internet assumed the reporter who broke it must have been hacked</p><p>Well, if last year’s NBA trade deadline was a snooze, this year’s could be likened to something closer to a Red Bull laced with amphetamine. This particular deadline was already destined for the NBA history books with the shocking swap of Luka Dončić of the Dallas Mavericks for Anthony Davis of the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday, marking what many agree is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball">biggest trade in league history</a>. But the seismic move shifted the proverbial tectonic plates of the rest of the league, too, as other teams followed suit with their own dramatic dominos. The annual February musical chairs have never had a more feverish soundtrack, so let’s break down the preliminary assessment of which teams came out ah

<p>Prayer plants are notoriously fussy – the key to keeping them happy is to mimic their natural environment as much as possible</p><p><strong>What’s the problem?</strong><br>
 My calathea seems unhappy no matter&nbsp;what I do.</p><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br>
 Calatheas, now reclassified as Goeppertia and commonly called prayer plants, are known as the drama queens of the plant world. They’re native to tropical rainforests and require our home environments to mimic these to survive. This means they prefer consistent humidity, warm temperatures and filtered light. Common issues arise from low humidity, dry soil or tap water containing salts and chemicals. They’re also sensitive to drafts, sudden temperature changes and direct sunlight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/07/houseplant-clinic-help-my-calathea-is-so-temperamental">Continue reading...</a>

News blackouts designed to preserve the innocence of a child can make the world seem more not less frightening, and so on.</p><p>The obvious exception to all this is tech, which takes away all of our abilities to self-regulate.

<p>A collection of professional leftovers that can only diminish the posthumous reputation of a master of high literature</p><p>A time there was, and a recent time, when big beasts stalked the groves of academe. This was in the last quarter or so of the 20th century, the leafy days of Althusser and Paul de Man, of the terrible twins Guattari and Deleuze, of Foucault, Derrida and Sollers, of Susan Sontag and the delightful Julia Kristeva. It was the age of theory, after the demise of the new criticism and before even a shred of cannon smoke was yet visible above the battlefields of the coming culture wars.</p><p>How sure of ourselves we were, the heirs of Adorno and Walter Benjamin. We knew, because Nietzsche had told us so, that there are no facts, only interpretations – sound familiar, from present times? – and that danger alone is the mother of morals.
