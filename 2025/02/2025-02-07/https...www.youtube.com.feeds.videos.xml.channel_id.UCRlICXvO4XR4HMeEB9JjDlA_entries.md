For years, scientists speculated about an enormous black hole or some unseen mega-structure, but modern telescopes finally revealed the truth: the Great Attractor isn’t a thing - it’s a place. It’s the gravitational centre of the Laniakea Supercluster, a vast web of galaxies pulling us in. But don’t worry - thanks to the universe’s accelerating expansion, we’ll never actually reach it. In fact, everything outside our little cluster of galaxies is eventually going to drift so far away, it will disappear from view entirely.
