I am really, like REALLY pleased with this design. It. Just. Works. No fine tuning needed, it's just the right way to do this! After spending so many years it is super rewarding to have found a solution that feels like it's really "IT". Satisfying galore. This year we are doing some simple behind the scenes video updates for wintergatan community on patron and for YouTube members. Low production value and spontaneous stuff in-between the main channel videos. Thank you to everyone who are backing!
