<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Switched back and have run into a couple issues that I am not sure what is causing the issues and cannot find any other posts.</p> <p>I have tried using Arch Linux and Nobara(as I thought that I seen Nobara has done some special tweaks to the Nvidia driver and that may that would fix things), am having these issues on both distros using Plasma and Wayland.</p> <p>1) I set the time that my display and system should sleep after, on Arch the display would sleep with no problems and on Nobara it would sleep and then almost immediately turn back on. The PC on the other hand on Arch would not go into sleep mode and would stay on then with Nobara it would try to sleep but then turn back on as well. If I try to click sleep in the app launcher it tries but cannot successfully sleep either on Nobara. Using the latest 570 driver on distros.</p> <p>Has anyone else had this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are many games that support Linux and many that Don&#39;t I&#39;m just wondering how many of you love games/apps that support things like Windows/Mac/Even Mobile. And yet the companies that own the apps will not exactly support Linux. Once again as of Today there are about 1.6m members in this subreddit, And I&#39;m not thinking full on assault, but I&#39;m pretty sure if enough Linux users comment to the companies social medias and such we may eventually get these games on Linux. Imagine Photoshop or Roblox or any other non-Linux-Supported app on Linux. Maybe we should stop complaining in sections like YT comments about Linux being banned from these games and actually start asking them to support Linux? It might eventually piss these companies off and they&#39;ll give us what we ask for just to get us off of them.<br/> No I&#39;m not saying that we should TARGET companies to get their apps on Linux, but I&#39;m asking is this a good idea?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What do you know about lightweight alternatives for initialization on Arch or Slackware bases? Im looking for one that preferably follows Linux protocol. It does one thing and it does it well. Rather than do everything. I don’t like the idea of having such a large process controlling so many moving parts. </p> <p>It sounds like a recipe for moving Linux users to ease of use and consumerism similar to how Microsoft operates. I don’t like how many Linux users are so lax with the idea of giving freedoms up in return for something popular/the only option rather than helping put together good projects of their own.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/X-Shiro"> /u/X-Shiro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ijop62/systemdinitialization_alternatives/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ijop62/systemdinitialization_alternatives/">[co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use firefox but I frequently need to use chromium for testing websites or for the devtools (slightly different). But if I install chromium, it decides that actually my image viewer isn&#39;t good enough, apparently I need to open a whole browser to view a single png when I have 5 different applications VASTLY more approritate for looking at images than a browser. I have multiple programs for looking at and editing text and yet xml NEEDS to be opened in a browser where I can&#39;t even edit it??? Then it asks you &quot;hey wanna set me as the default 🤓&quot; as if it didn&#39;t already replace firefox everywhere it was a default. I just wanna install chromium and not dig through settings to make it not be extremely stupid. this actually pisses me off so fucking much. Just be normal wtf????</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/petitlita"> /u/petitlita </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
