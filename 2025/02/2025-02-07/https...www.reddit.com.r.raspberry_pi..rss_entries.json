I know the differences between 32bit and 64bit, performance, memory usage, memory availability, etc. My question is this...if I were to load the 64-bit OS, but then change the boot of the Pi to boot directly to the command line, would my memory usage be comparable to the 64bit Lite version? The reason I ask is because I&#39;m attempting to roll out numerous RPi units at my company...and not all of my tech support staff are familiar with, or comfortable using the command-line only. I figured if I install the full 64bit OS, they have the option to boot into the GUI/Desktop if they need to. </p> <p>The TL:DR version is this: Is 64bit Full OS running in Terminal mode roughly the same as 64bit Lite?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bbestvin\"> /u/bbestvin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",

The GUI works well with 4 cameras using the built-in USB ports on the Raspberry Pi. However, I want to extend the USB ports by adding 4 more, so I bought the Waveshare PCIe to 4-Ch USB3.2 Gen1 Board. I plugged it in and tested it, but only one camera is recording. I assumed that since I\u2019m using PCIe to extend the ports, there wouldn\u2019t be any bandwidth issues, but it seems like the 4 ports are sharing the bandwidth of the PCIe slot. BTW, I need three USB ports for other devices.

One of the components I&#39;m experimenting with is a DC-DC Boost converter. I&#39;ve placed the LM2577 module and added all the components listed in the specifications. However, when I connected the PCB to the Raspberry Pi, the inductor fried almost immediately. </p> <p>I realize that I need to use an inductor with a much higher current rating, but I&#39;m unsure how to choose the right one. I&#39;m trying to run a 5V to 12V converter, and the load on the 12V side draws very little current (just 10mA). </p> <p>What calc",
