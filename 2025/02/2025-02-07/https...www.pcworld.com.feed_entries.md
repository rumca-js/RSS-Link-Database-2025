<p>I apologize to anyone who happens to be walking by my house at the moment, especially if you have children present. The blue streak of cursing emanating from my office window is not meant for delicate ears. But I’m due for a GPU upgrade, and it’s going to cost a lot of money. </p>



<p>That’s probably not a surprise to most of you. Nvidia’s newest flagship graphics card is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">two-thousand-$%^ing-dollars</a>, the most expensive consumer card the company has ever made. Customized versions of the RTX 5090 are reaching towards $3,000, to say nothing of ridiculous versions <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2602219/asus-made-a-gold-rtx-5090-as-if-it-werent-expensive-enough-already.html">made for oligarchs</a>. The runner-up RTX 5080 is $1,000, and <a href="https://www.pcwo

<p>We love portable SSDs because they’re fast, small, and fulfill all sorts of purposes. But you can do a lot of the same stuff with a flash drive that’s even more compact and portable than an SSD.</p>



<p>And right now, the absolutely tiny <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MUF-128AB-AM-Plus-128GB/dp/B07D7Q41PM/">256GB Samsung Fit Plus is just $22 on Amazon</a>, a solid 37 percent off its usual $35 price.</p>



<p>The Samsung Fit Plus is a USB 3.1 flash drive that’s capable of reading data at up to 400MB/s, which is fast enough to move a full 4K movie in about a minute or so. It’s widely compatible across devices, so you can plug it into PCs and Macs, laptops and tablets, gaming consoles, and more. Anything that takes a USB-A connection.</p>



<p>It’s so tiny that you won’t even notice it. (In fact, you might even lose it, so be careful! Use the bui

<p>Look, I know rich people aren’t uniformly stupid, but there definitely seems to be a subset of luxury goods that assume such. (Luxury fashion <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/the-mystery-of-the-2000-ikea-shopping-bag">made to look like thrift store goods</a> comes to mind.) And Asus apparently wants a piece of that blue-blood pie because it’s making an RTX 5090 graphics card covered in friggin’ gold.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/me-en/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/rog-astral/rog-astral-rtx5090-o32g-dhahab-edition/">Asus ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 Dhahab OC Edition</a> is exclusive to the Middle East, and boy, does it want you to know it. The custom all-gold cooler is covered in Arabic calligraphy and imagery, complete with camels and opulent skyscrapers. If there’s a tasteless joke about this card being reserved for Saudi princes, then Asus

<p>If your laptop or PC has been infected by ransomware, i.e. a blackmail virus, you’ll receive a message asking you to pay a ransom. You’ll feel like your in the the hot seat, but that’s the whole point.</p>



<p>The criminal will crank up the pressure by threatening to destroy the encrypted data forever in a few days or publish it on the internet. If ever find yourself in this kind of situation, then your antivirus has failed. (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407277/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">You are running antivirus</a>, right?) </p>



<p>In order to decrypt those files without paying the criminals money, you need to know which ransomware has your data.
