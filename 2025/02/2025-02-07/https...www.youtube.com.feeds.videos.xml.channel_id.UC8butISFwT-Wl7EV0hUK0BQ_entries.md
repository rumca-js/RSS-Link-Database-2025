On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Peggy Wang. She's used freeCodeCamp to learn how coding, worked in Big Tech as a robotics engineer, and she's cofounder and CTO of Ego AI, which builds human-like agents for video games.

We talk about:
- How she grew up a first generation immigrant and public school kid in Milwaukee
- How her love of robotics helped her get into Stanford
- How freeCodeCamp served as a key resource to build her developer chops
- The near future of humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and human-like AI agents in games
