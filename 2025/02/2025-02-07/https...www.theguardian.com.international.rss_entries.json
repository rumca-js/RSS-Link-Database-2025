Fruit-forward reds and off-dry whites are the way forward</p><p>One reason many shy away from pairing wine with spicy food is that it\u2019s so, <em>so</em> easy to get it wrong. There are several constituent parts in a wine that unfavourably accentuate the heat of a dish: for example, spice can increase our perception of alcohol, causing an unpleasant burn, intense acidity and astringent bitterness. This stifles the fruit and smothers the complexities of the dish, too.</p><p>It\u2019s not a gastronomic question that\u2019s easily answered with a catchy maxim, either. Chilli heat fills the mouth in a different way from the sting of wasabi, say, which is itself different from Sichuan pepper and fresh ginger. But it can be done, should you wish to have a glass of wine with your spicy meal rather than a beer, fruity cocktail or lassi.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/07/are-there-any-wines-that-match-with-spice-hannah-crosbie\"",
