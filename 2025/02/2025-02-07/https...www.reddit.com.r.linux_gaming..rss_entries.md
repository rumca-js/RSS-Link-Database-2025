## Xbox 360 Wireless receiver vs Instruments?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there! I&#39;m quite new to Linux as a whole, but I was wondering if there&#39;s drivers specifically for the 360 Wireless receiver or 360 plastic instruments. I have a YARG setup for which I&#39;m connecting: A wireless Rock Band 2 Guitar, a Wireless The Beatles Rock Band Drumkit with cymbals and a GH Warriors of Rock guitar. The instruments all connect correctly, but they&#39;re recognized as &quot;Xbox 360 Wireless Controller&quot; so the bindings are all messed up. I managed to bind the inputs on the guitars with no issues, but the drums are a nightmare, each pad triggers 3-4 different bindings which sometimes are shared with other pads. Is there a PROPER way to get Linux to recognize the instuments by what they are instead of generic xbox controllers? Or am I screwed? I&#39;m using Ubuntu 24.04</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ericklc02"> /u/ericklc02 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading for a while about distros and can&#39;t completely decide. It&#39;s a guess, but I think knowledge starts to overwhelm me. I am looking for distro as I said in title, but there is a problem. I used Pop!_OS, and it was flawless, but I couldn&#39;t stand the Pop!_OS Shop, so I came back to Windows but as usually... windows is just not mine thing anymore. When I wasn&#39;t using Linux for everything but just programming/learning I loved Mint and Fedora that&#39;s why now I was looking for something similar(Bazzite and Nobara was the only options I could find but Bazzite is a NO for me.) Also, I have read that sometimes those optimizations for Linux&#39;s kernel is not that big thing in performance case, and I thought, Zorin OS, is also an option or Fedora and Mint. Therefore, I am in the place where I don&#39;t know is it true, is it worth it to go for gaming distro or just stick to something I know and liked(Fedora and Mint).</p>

I had to force quit the game to get it to close. I reopened it and forced it to close quicker and the file is now only 172.2MB, but looking around in the file it looks like it&#39;s missing or searching for some &quot;.dll&quot; files?
