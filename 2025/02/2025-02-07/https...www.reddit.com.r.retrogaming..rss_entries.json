Looking for some help to identify it. </p> <p>It was probably early to mid-90s. It took place in a 2D plane, somewhat similar to sidescrolling space shooters that were popular at the time, but the distinguishing feature about this one that I remember very clearly that it was omni-directional: you could fly your spacecraft left, right, up down to explore. May be misremembering, but I remember the game being quite fast-paced, you would have a real sense of speed flying around, and could even do donut-type circular drifting in your spaceship. You&#39;d then run into other enemy spaceships along the way that would be similar in size to your own that would move similarly and fight them in 1v1 space combat. I also seem to recall that there were pickups along the map such as fuel for your spacecraft.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

Basically i moved in July of 2024 and did something real stupid. While packing i wanted to put my gameboy games separately from my real games so i would know where they were. But instead i put them in a random game case out of over 300 physical games i have. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t notice they were missing until tonight however, due to the fact that these are for my gameboy player on my gamecube and i don\u2019t have the disc since i don\u2019t feel like selling a kidney to even smell one, i didn\u2019t even think about these until i was watching scott Wozniak talk about game boy launch titles and i was like \u201cWait, i have gameboy games\u201d </p> <p>so i looked through the over 300 games in my collection",
