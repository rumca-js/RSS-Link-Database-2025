Initially, I thought of S3 and CloudFront (for CDN), but I realized the cost would be substantial due to high egress usage (my application would heavily consume egress over storage). After some research, I discovered Cloudflare R2, which offers free unlimited egress, and that was amazing for me!</p> <p>My question is, would I incur extra costs for having a CDN serve my videos, or does Cloudflare R2 already include a CDN by default? </p> <p>Also, while searching, I found other, even cheaper providers like Backblaze, Wasabi, Telnyx, and IDrive e2. Do you think Cloudflare R2 is the best choice for this use case, or are there better providers?

So I&#39;ve decided to dive deeper into locally hosting it.</p> <p>My use case would be mostly aid in programming, ideally if I would be able to provide context of my project so the code would be more or less adjusted to my specific project. I have some ideas about using it also in more general manner, like some kind of personal assistant, but that&#39;s not the main reason now.</p> <p>I&#39;ve started reading some stuff and watching videos of guys explaining their builds, but some seem to be using mostly GPUs where CPU is just and addition and all the work is done on the GPUs(like 2-4x 3090 or some other 24GB cards) and some use more like regular server builds with Threadripper and ~200 GB of RAM.</p> <p>",
