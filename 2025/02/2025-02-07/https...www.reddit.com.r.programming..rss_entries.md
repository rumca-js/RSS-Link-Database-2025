<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I have previous background in mathematics &amp; statistics which gave me insights into coding in R, SQl, matlab but it’s been a while (almost 5 years) since I have written a code. I was thinking of attending a bootcamp in India to learn full stack development and especially learn python. Since, there are a lot of online courses on YouTube, I do not have the discipline to learn alone and build a routine around online learning. I prefer to learn along side a group of people that challenge me to be better and correct me when I m wrong instead of spending hours to figure out by myself.</p> <p>So, here’s my dilemma. I was thinking to attend Code for India which offers a full stack development course over a period of 6 months and promises great result. </p> <p>The other option is Masai school which seems more to do with institutional education rather than more hands on education offered by Code for India. The only issue is I don’t know much about Hyder
