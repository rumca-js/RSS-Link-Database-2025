## In need of an isometric 2D adventure RPG.

I just played a bit of the Stronghold remaster and got a real gut punch for how much I miss this style of game.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently playing a JRPG game SaGa Emerald Beyond and It&#39;s an interesting case of this situation. The plot looks like it was purposefully made bad to troll players, the character designs make you wish the game was text based, the voice acting makes you mute the sound, there&#39;s no shops or traditional dungeons. The UI is horrible and obtuse, the levelling and skill system is random and esoteric and overall it looks like the game&#39;s budget was non-existent.</p> <p>However the game has probably the best turn based combat that I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s very difficult, complex and has an immense depth. No rpg wether crpg or jrpg have even come close to this level of turn based in my opinion.</p> <p>What are examples of other games with situations similar to this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Visconti753"> /u/Visconti753 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in my 30s, so I can remember when the majority of the big names in video games were coming out of the USA, from indies all the way to AAA, from RTSes like Starcraft to shooters like Doom to everything in between. USA (and Canada) dominated game development with Japan being the only real competitor.</p> <p>Flash forward to today, and it feels like a lot has changed. Japan remains more or less in the same place it&#39;s always been, but America feels like a dim shadow. Most of the games I&#39;m talking about with my friends are not being made in America. They&#39;re almost entirely East Asian or European. Hell, I&#39;d say Poland and Sweden might be overtaking the USA and these are not large countries.</p> <p>That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t commercially successful games out of the USA, but they all seem to be the likes of Call of Duty 26 or Madden 53. Cyberpunk 2077 or Elden Ring they are not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by
