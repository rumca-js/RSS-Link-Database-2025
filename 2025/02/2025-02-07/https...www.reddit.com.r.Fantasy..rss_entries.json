Was really excited because I saw people online saying the series only gets better.</p> <p>But I have to say, so far this book has felt like a chore to read. The appearance of the White Ship nearly half way through this book is the first thing to garner my interest!!</p> <p>Anywho, wanted to ask if the second half of the book is better? I\u2019m genuinely not trying to be rude by asking this. For example, a friend who had once recommended to me The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo warned me the first half would be boring/kind of a drag to get through but if I stuck it through, I wouldn\u2019t be able to put down the second half.

One of the biggest things I look for in a series is whether each consecutive book&#39;s ratings on Goodreads are increasing. The first book of a series acts as a filter for all readers. This means that since all types of readers are picking up the first book, it should, logically, be the lowest-rated in the entire series. For the most part, only fans of the first book will move on to read the second book in the series. And if only people who enjoyed the first book are rating the second book, the ratings should be higher. However, that assumes both works are of the same quality.</p> <p>If you find, when looking at Goodreads ratings of a series, that the next book has even around <strong>the same rating</strong> as its predecessor, then that book is likely worse than the one before it.

I was a voracious reader at her age and now a writer, so I think she just hasn\u2019t found a book that interests her enough. She likes TV a lot and is capable of following deep plots, she likes a new series called Scaredy Cats on Netflix, about three girls and the mother of one of them is a witch, so the girls have all kinds of scary adventures. That\u2019s the kind of book I think she\u2019d like a lot. We\u2019ve read Isadora Moon togheter and is getting a bit dull for her age. She needs deeper emotion and adventure.
