We wanted a platform that is quick and easy to save, with everyone being able to see the scores. A simple online scoring app was born.</p> <p>We are also board game fans! We decided to expand our scoring to include scorecards. They are flexible and cover some of our favourite games that come with paper scoresheets in the box.</p> <p>With a collection of game tools to ease your play, and a sprinkle of analytics, we believe this is an app all can enjoy.</p> <p><stro",

It was around 1979-81, a young couple is playing a board game in a park, after one would win the other would say, &quot;One more game.&quot;, at the end of the commercial, it showed the same couple, now very old, still sitting at the same park, still playing the same game, with the loser of the last match saying, &quot;One more game.&quot; This commercial really unnerved me as a kid, and I would really like to see it again as an adult.
