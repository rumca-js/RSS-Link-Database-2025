Drenched in Scottish folklore and mythology, this dark, emotional and mystical high seas fantasy adventure will strike you with equal parts awe and terror. “The lapping of the waves on the sand filled her ears like a promise. The sea still called her; maybe it always would. But there was no running now. No ignoring what she had to do.” If there is one thing I adore in my stories, it’s wayward women bucking against society’s expectations and trying to find their own place in the world. So, colour me not surprised when I immediately fell head over heels in love with Isla Blackwood. After spending the last seven years at sea searching for her calling, she is reluctantly drawn back to the Blackwood Estate by a mysterious letter from her dying mother. But upon arrival she finds
