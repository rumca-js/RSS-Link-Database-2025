        "description": "The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak 2 reviewed by George Yang on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak 2 makes a few missteps with the pacing and structure of its multiversal story, but it\u2019s buoyed by a focus on quality character moments and impressive worldbuilding over earthshaking reveals. The turn-based combat and party customization haven\u2019t changed much at all, but they didn\u2019t really need to, and the real-time action side of things has seen some small but meaningful improvements. Daybreak 2 doesn\u2019t move the needle in the overall Calvard saga much, but this more personal story is still another good entry in the Trails series overall.",

In fact, it\u2019s already well worth its early access asking price. It\u2019s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing.",

So that means rumors of a delay are just that: rumors. At least as of right now. But IGN spoke with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick just before the financial report, and he said; \u201cLook, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things. So we feel really good about it.\" We of course probed a bit more, asking him for an update on the development of #GTA6 and how things are looking over at Rockstar Games, to which he responded: \u201cI think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally. We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs.
