As someone who occasionally reviews laptops, there are times when I\u2019ve accumulated a collection of them in my home office.

They often contain rare earth materials like lithium. Not only does lithium take a lot of resources to mine, but its extraction can also upset natural ecosystems. Plus, when it\u2019s time to dump an old laptop, all or parts of it will end up sitting in landfill and contaminating nearby ground waters.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact laptops have on the environment is bigger than you may think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading:</",
