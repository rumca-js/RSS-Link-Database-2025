The demo would have:</p> <p>-Interactive brewing system(with a few steps removed for simplicity like making malt)</p> <p>-Interactive cooking system with procedural slicing.</p> <p>-Menu building system to choose what you will be serving depending on your level.</p> <p>-Customer interaction system</p> <p>-Grid customization system(Each appliance is 1x1 or 1x2 meters) </p> <p>-Simplistic character customization </p> <p>Basically you’ll be running around preforming tasks to serve the customers as fast as possible. I’m hoping to add different modes like a more casual mode, Speed mode, maybe even a job simulator-like mode where everything is in reach but that can also be achieved b

Based on my research, it seems like the Insta360 and other similarly priced cameras do not take 3D video but instead just take 360 flat video.</p> <p>Are there any inexpensive or reasonably priced options for cameras that can capture 3D 180 degree VR video (not just flat video, but video that has 3D and depth like what you experience when you watch an actual VR video)? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/n64answer"> /u/n

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have had a PSVR2 for a couple years and it made me fall in love with VR. So much so that I decided a couple weeks ago to buy a Meta Quest 3 for games and movies/tv shows, as well as remote play from my PS5. For the most part, I’ve loved it, while still loving my PSVR2. I’m not intending it to replace that headset, I just want to experience the best that vr has to offer.</p> <p>Now, even though I’m enjoying the Quest 3, I see everywhere people saying that Meta will most likely move away from prioritizing games and that vr studios in general cannot afford to keep making games. This has me thinking that maybe now is an obviously bad time to spend and invest in this headset and ecosystem. I can still return the headset and get my money back, which I think is possibly the smart thing to do, especially since keeping it would mean I need to buy games in the ecosystem.

You wouldn’t be walking around and moving, but you’d be “experiencing” each scene as a passive viewer, which would be happening all around you (wherever the static camera was placed for maximum effect).</p> <p>I realize it would require a ton of work, probably a lot of AI having to take 2D film of objects, people and locations, and using assets to translate it into a 3D space, as well as using AI graphics to fill in the blanks for what isn’t already shown in the film, but could it POSSIBLE down the road?

Interesting, for sure, but probably nowhere near realistic in the near future - for example, having some sort of integrated unit that can make you visualize and visually immerse yourself in what you’re thinking, or “relive” memories even. Not gonna lie, that sounds like Matrix-level tech to me as an almost middle aged man. I <em>do</em> want to believe some sort of possibility along those lines will be forthcoming eventually though.</p> <p>As for me, I wanna keep it humble and in line with what I’m spending most of my time on when in VR – gaming &amp; home workouts.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Unfortunately achieving smoothness is torture given every game has its own recipe for a turbo smooth experience. Some games are more smooth with higher resolution and lower FPS. Other games are smoother with HEVC than AV1, OpenXR or SteamVR. Then we have Windows features (such as GPU scheduling) creating stutters or judders etc. And after all that, finally, game settings. Which can be tricky because some games stutter/judder because of frame-times, others only stutter the first couple minutes loading stuff etc, making difficult to figure out whats going on.</p> <p>I wish we had a consensus for smoothness in games, because clearly lots of people are playing with bad frametimes without them noticing, and I envy them so bloody much :`)</p> <p>P.S - Thank god we barely have to play with routers settings.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tikitaks"> /u/Tikitaks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically, I&#39;m living temporarily at my parent&#39;s house, and my room doesn&#39;t have an ethernet cable. I have good WiFi signal, but seeing as it&#39;ll sometimes get weak during regular online gaming, it won&#39;t be great for wireless VR either.<br/> I think my only option would be to get a wifi extender, as I can&#39;t install a router in my room. Which one would be a good choice, if at all?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SmallTownLoneHunter"> /u/SmallTownLoneHunter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iji4bx/is_there_a_good_wifi_extender_for_vr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iji4bx/is_there_a_good_wifi_extender_for_vr/">[comments]</a></span>
