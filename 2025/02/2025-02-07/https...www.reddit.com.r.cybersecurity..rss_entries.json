I know there are people that are so good at being consultants but starting your career with one, from my experience, was not a good idea.

Unfortunately the mere fact of stating I\u2019m a consultant in interviews is like triggering a smear campaign on myself \ud83e\udd79 Now my question is about soc analyst L1 roles, could it be a good entry point to more tech-y and hands on roles or should I only be looking for L2/L3. I know that soc analysis is seen as extremely boring but I\u2019d take this over another day in consulting. Please do tell me from your experience.
