I&#39;m having an issue where the colors don&#39;t look correct (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/DB6IesE">https://imgur.com/a/DB6IesE</a>) and there is audio hum. My setup worked previously when I was using the gcomp switch instead of the SVS.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also tried hooking up my N64 via SVideo input from the SVS to the Retrotink 4k with component output, but the picture was in B&amp;W (audio seemed to be fine). Hooking it up directly to the Retrotink 4k, it works perfectly.</p> <p>Do these symptoms seem like an issue with the SVS, or perhaps wrong Retrotink settings? I know the VGA output module is recommended for the Retrotink 4k, but I didn&#39;t realize that at the time of purchase. Is that what I need to get to fix this?</p> <p>Thanks for any help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to play an old space shooter on my Dad&#39;s computer and I can&#39;t for the life of me track down which one it was from memory. Looking for some help to identify it. </p> <p>It was probably early to mid-90s. It took place in a 2D plane, somewhat similar to sidescrolling space shooters that were popular at the time, but the distinguishing feature about this one that I remember very clearly that it was omni-directional: you could fly your spacecraft left, right, up down to explore. May be misremembering, but I remember the game being quite fast-paced, you would have a real sense of speed flying around, and could even do donut-type circular drifting in your spaceship. You&#39;d then run into other enemy spaceships along the way that would be similar in size to your own that would move similarly and fight them in 1v1 space combat. I also seem to recall that there were pickups along the map such as fuel for your spacecraft.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -
