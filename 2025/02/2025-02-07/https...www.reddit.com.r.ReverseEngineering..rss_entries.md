<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i was bored, so i reversed the gcaptcha4.js file to find out how they generate all their params (lotParser etc.) and then encrypt it in the &quot;w&quot; param. The code works, all you have to do is enter the risk type and captcha id.<br/> If this blows up, i might add support for more types.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xkiiann"> /u/xkiiann </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/xKiian/GeekedTest">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ijr1yz/geetest_v4_fully_reverse_engineered_slide_and_ai/">[comments]</a></span>
