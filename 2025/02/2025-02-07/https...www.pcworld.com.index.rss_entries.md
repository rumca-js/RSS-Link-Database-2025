<p>Handheld gaming PCs are great. But they’re not powerful, at least not compared to full-sized gaming desktops. But then again, there’s nothing stopping you from plugging in a desktop GPU — Asus even makes some just for that purpose.</p>



<p>But what if you did it with a brand-new RTX 5090 using an external GPU adapter? Adam and Will did just that in the latest PCWorld YouTube video.</p>



<p>To be specific, they’re using a new <a href="https://gpd.hk/gpdwinmax2">GPD Win Max 2</a>, a tiny mini-laptop with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor (and integrated Radeon 890M graphics) and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2282798/oculink-what-you-should-know-about-the-new-interface-for-external-graphics-cards.html">an onboard OCuLink port for a wide PCIe data pipe</a>.

<p>The Steam Deck is great. It’s also big and heavy, especially compared to older handheld gaming devices like the Game Boy or Switch. What’s a PC gamer to do to soothe their tired arms? With this new accessory, you could simply strap it to anything that’s made for a GoPro action camera. Like your chest, for example.</p>

<p>I apologize to anyone who happens to be walking by my house at the moment, especially if you have children present. The blue streak of cursing emanating from my office window is not meant for delicate ears. But I’m due for a GPU upgrade, and it’s going to cost a lot of money. </p>



<p>That’s probably not a surprise to most of you. Nvidia’s newest flagship graphics card is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">two-thousand-$%^ing-dollars</a>, the most expensive consumer card the company has ever made.

<p>In February 2024, Google removed a practical feature from its search engine: cached web pages. Back then, even when a web page became unavailable, you could browse Google’s cache — essentially a snapshot of what Google last saw when it visited the page.</p>



<p>After Google removed cached pages from search results, the only real alternative was to use the <a href="http://www.archive.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet Archive</a>. Today, the Internet Archive stores <a href="https://archive.org/about">over 835 billion web pages</a> for free, along with millions of other content types including books, audio, video, and software.</p>



<p>Now, the two have come together in an unexpected combo: Google has made it possible to access the Internet Archive’s saved version of a web page directly from the search results.</p>

<p>When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2393443/samsung-galaxy-book4-edge-review.html">reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge</a>, we gave it a 4-star rating. We’re pretty positive on it, but one thing bothered us: it was expensive compared to other Snapdragon laptops.</p>



<p>But that’s no longer an issue with this sale. Right now, you can <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-book4-edge-copilot-pc-14-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-snapdragon-x-elite-3-4ghz-16gb-memory-512gb-storage-sapphire-blue/6583789.p?skuId=6583789">get a Galaxy Book4 Edge for $320 off at Best Buy</a>. That brings the cost down to just $1,030 (or 24 percent off its usual price).</p>

<p>The Eufy SoloCam S220 isn’t just wireless (for easy installation anywhere), but also has a built-in solar panel that keeps it charged day to day. You never have to worry about taking it down every few months just to charge it back up and re-mount it wherever it goes.</p>



<p>A few years ago, I had to set up my own security system for my current home. It was a pain in the neck with all the wires, and it would’ve been so much easier (and cheaper and faster) if solar-powered cameras like this were as affordable back then as they are now. If I had to do it again, I

<p>USB labeling has long been a mystery for consumers. Terms like “USB 3.2 Gen 2” or “SuperSpeed USB 10Gbps” have caused more confusion than guidance, and shopping for USB accessories can feel like a crapshoot.</p>



<p>The good news is that the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) is trying to clean things up with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2572128/an-updated-usb-logo-will-now-mark-the-fastest-docking-stations.html">newly simplified logos and icons</a> that better convey USB speed and performance at a glance.</p>



<p>This move by the USB-IF comes in response to criticism that existing version designations — such as “USB 3.2” or “USB4v2” — are too complicated. Instead of emphasizing technical terms, why not focus on what consumers <em>actually</em> care about? How fast data is transferred, how much power can be transmitted, etc.</p>

<p>I spend way too many hours in my desk chair every day, which gave me all kinds of aches and pains when I used to have a poor quality chair. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your desk chair but can’t stomach the prices, here’s an opportunity worth jumping on.</p>

<p>It only took about nine years, but I’ve finally made Windows Task View part of my everyday workflow.</p>



<p>Task View arrived with Windows 10 in 2015, providing an alternative to cramming all of your open windows into the space afforded by your screen. By clicking the Task View button on the Windows taskbar — or just pressing <strong>Windows key + Tab</strong> — you can see all your open windows and arrange them into separate workspaces, known as virtual desktops.</p>



<p>It’s the kind of feature I should theoretically love, but my earlier attempts to use it always ended in failure. Too often I’d forget about those extra virtual desktops I had set up and would gravitate back toward opening all my windows in one place.</p>



<p>By rethinking my approach to Task View — and by taking advantage of some new Windows features — I’ve finally made a habit of

<p>Recently, I’ve started to consider my own impact on the environment. As someone who occasionally reviews laptops, there are times when I’ve accumulated a collection of them in my home office. Whenever I gaze upon this backlog, I’m reminded of my own contribution to the omnipresent problem of electronic waste, which is why my next laptop will be an eco-friendly one.</p>



<p>Laptops, as you may or may not know, are not great for the environment! They often contain rare earth materials like lithium. Not only does lithium take a lot of resources to mine, but its extraction can also upset natural ecosystems. Plus, when it’s time to dump an old laptop, all or parts of it will end up sitting in landfill and contaminating nearby ground waters. </p>



<p>The impact laptops have on the environment is bigger than you may think.</p>
