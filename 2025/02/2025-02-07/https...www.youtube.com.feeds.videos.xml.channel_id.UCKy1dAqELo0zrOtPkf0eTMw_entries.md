The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak 2 reviewed by George Yang on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak 2 makes a few missteps with the pacing and structure of its multiversal story, but it’s buoyed by a focus on quality character moments and impressive worldbuilding over earthshaking reveals. The turn-based combat and party customization haven’t changed much at all, but they didn’t really need to, and the real-time action side of things has seen some small but meaningful improvements. Daybreak 2 doesn’t move the needle in the overall Calvard saga much, but this more personal story is still another good entry in the Trails series overall.

Tokyo Xtreme Racer reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC.

Tokyo Xtreme Racer is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing.

## Severance Cast Confirms Controversial Fan Theory and That Huge Episode 4 Twist | Season 2 Interview

The Apple TV+ hit series Severance is focused around such a high concept – office workers’ personalities being “severed” into “innies” and “outies” – that the viewer will be excused for sometimes forgetting some of the nuances of the world in which these characters live. That’s why Season 2, Episode 4's big episode, “Woe's Hollow,” is noteworthy for its setting alone, as the Lumon Macrodata Refinement team of Mark (Adam Scott), Helly (Britt Lower), Irving (John Turturro), and Dylan (Zach Cherry) finally get the chance to spend some time outside the office. Like, out in the wilderness. Where there are trees and snow and, you know, sky, which is something most of them have never seen. It’s a big deal for them!

Don't read any further if you don't want to see spoilers from this week's Severance episode!

Also a big deal is several revelations in the episode, including the climactic moment when we learn that outie Helena has actually been posing as innie Helly all season, presumably spyi

According to the Take-Two financial earnings call that took place today, at the time of this recording, the parent company is confident that GTA 6 will hit its release date of Fall 2025. So that means rumors of a delay are just that: rumors. At least as of right now. But IGN spoke with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick just before the financial report, and he said; “Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things. So we feel really good about it." We of course probed a bit more, asking him for an update on the development of #GTA6 and how things are looking over at Rockstar Games, to which he responded: “I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally. We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our wh
