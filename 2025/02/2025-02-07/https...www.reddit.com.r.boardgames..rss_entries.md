Problem is a lot of game websites are blocked on our work computers (like the free website for Phantom Ink).</p> <p>After some googling I found a lot of silly type games that can be played online, but what are some more serious board games that you think could be adapted? I&#39;m fine with games that would take a moderator, but it would be fun to have ones that everyone could play.

I have personal criticisms of Arcs, but that isn’t the primary intent of this discussion.</p> <p>I’ll disclose that I dislike the style of games Cole Wehrle designs, so originally, I had absolutely no interest in Arcs. However, over and over again, I heard people saying Arcs was really innovative with how it integrates trick taking. I always am very interested in games providing a novel experience, so all this talk had me interested (and trick taking is also a mechanism I often enjoy). A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to play Arcs.</p> <p>I was cautious with my optimism, but I did appreciate Arcs integration of trick taking. It offered a way to direct players actions in a style of game I often feel somewhat lost (especially at the start) with how much freedom the game provides you, in addition to adding the interesting decisi

I know there’s a lot of love for BGStats and there are some similarities but I hope you try this out and have fun with it 😁</p> <p><strong>Why Pocket Tally?</strong></p> <p>Pocket Tally started out of playing pool with a few friends, and a need to keep scores over time with multiple people. We wanted a platform that is quick and easy to save, with everyone being able to see the scores. A simple online scoring app was born.</p> <p>We are also board game fans! We decided to expand our scoring to include scorecards. They are flexible and cover some of our favourite games that come with paper scoresheets in the box.</p> <p>With a collection of game tools to ease your play, and a sprinkle of analytics, we believe this is an app all can enjoy.</p> <p><stro

I personally like the game but they are a few flaw that I started noticing the more I played it.</p> <ol> <li><p>Ep monster lack of movement. I feel like ep monster is very still compare to elder one minion since they can only move when drawing the mythos card. Whereas goo minion move during mythos drawing phase and when elder one advance or move to the next stage. A simple fix to this is refer to their respective unknown monster ability when the summoning track advance. (From s3)Might make it a little harder but much more enjoyable in my opinion.</p></li> <li><p>Flavor text. This is just a minor pet peeve of mine but when I look at the campaign page, I can see that they already have flavor text for the elder one and it&#39;s minion, why didn&#39;t they just slap them to the box somewhere? S3 EP lore on the manual page is nice, but they might as wel
