<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Title isn&#39;t a question. I just happened to search for that here and didn&#39;t find any recent post which had a working solution that didn&#39;t require specific software or hardware. (Maybe I haven&#39;t been thorough enough and someone will point out another post) </p> <p>So after a little thinking and testing, here&#39;s a way to do it on a Windows 10/11 system, without downloading any software, as long as you have a virtualization-capable computer:<br/> Just enable the Windows Sandbox, and launch the app you want to record on that sandbox. You can enable it via &quot;Enable or disable Windows features&quot;, in the &quot;Programs and Features&quot; menu of the control panel. Then, you can use the built-in screen capture tool (Win+Shift+S) on your system (not in the sandbox) to record the area of the screen you wish to.</p> <p>Since the sandbox is technically just a VM, it&#39;s supposed to be airtight (at least sufficiently for our needs here
