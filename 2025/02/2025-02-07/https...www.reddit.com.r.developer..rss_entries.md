<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m working on a test project in PHP and trying to follow good OOP practices. I&#39;ve separated my concerns using DTOs, a repository, and a validator, but I want to make sure I&#39;m on the right track. Here are a few things I&#39;m wondering about:</p> <ul> <li>Am I structuring my classes correctly ( DTOs, Controller, Repository)?</li> <li>Is my validation logic in the right place, or should it be handled differently?</li> <li>Any improvements in terms of error handling and data transformation?</li> <li>Other best practices I might be missing?</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://github.com/richard9004/TvSeriesApiApp/tree/master">https://github.com/richard9004/TvSeriesApiApp/tree/master</a> </p> <p>I’d love any insights or suggestions from experienced PHP developers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RichardMendes90"> /u/RichardMendes90 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
