        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello. My tik tok account got hacked on Monday. I\u2019ve been attempting to make contact with tik tok help services and they\u2019re not responding. An in app security and safety update came up on the app and I clicked to read the new rules and I was immediately signed out of my account. The hacker had removed my phone number and my email address from the account. They haven\u2019t done anything with it and I don\u2019t have many followers so I don\u2019t understand what they want with it. All my drafts and videos are on there though and there are some sentimental ones of my mum who passed a few years ago. Is there anyone who can get the account back for me so I can kick the hacker off? Tik tok partially showed me the hackers email address as d***<a href=\"mailto:o@gmx.com\">o@gmx.com</a>. I completely understand if no can help but any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Compar",

I\u2019m not someone who would do something like this but it\u2019s simply unfair how we all pay the same price for this sports facility, but a select few always seem to nab the reservations. </p> <p>Here is my proposition: I\u2019m willing to pay someone to give me a roadmap (books, PDFs, YouTube videos), etc, that will take me from somebody who knows nothing about programming and networking, to someone that can successfully create his own reservation bot for making reservations on this website, so he can finally level the playing field again.</p> <p>First thing I\u2019d like to ask - anybody have some suggestions for the roadmap ? Anybody want to offer any free advice in terms of topics I need to study specifically ?</p> <p>Th",
