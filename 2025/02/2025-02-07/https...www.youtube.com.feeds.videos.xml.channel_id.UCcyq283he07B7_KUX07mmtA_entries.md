Dan Kolcun runs a business breaking in thousands of footballs each season for NFL and college teams. He’s prepped balls for multiple Super Bowls and for Ohio State, the highest-valued college football team. But before 2006, only NFL home teams were allowed to use specially prepared balls in games. Then a group of players, including Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, convinced the NFL to let both teams choose. That inspired college programs to take prepping more seriously too. Today, footballs are customized throughout production, from the leather to the shape of the ball.
