The blue streak of cursing emanating from my office window is not meant for delicate ears. But I\u2019m due for a GPU upgrade, and it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s probably not a surprise to most of you. Nvidia\u2019s newest flagship graphics card is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html\">two-thousand-$%^ing-dollars</a>, the most expensive consumer card the company has ever made. Customized versions of the RTX 5090 are reaching towards $3,000, to say nothing of ridiculous versions <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2602219/asus-made-a-gold-rtx-5090-as-if-it-werent-expensive-enough-already.html\">made for oligarchs</a>.
