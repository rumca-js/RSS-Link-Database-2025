## Harry Maguire is the hero as Manchester United squeeze past Leicester in FA Cup

<p>Harry Maguire completed his Manchester United redemption in the 93rd minute by nodding in Bruno Fernandes’s spiralling free-kick from the left to sweep the holders into the fifth round. Before then, Joshua Zirkzee’s 67th-minute equaliser appeared the lifeline United needed to keep a shaky FA Cup defence alive.</p><p>Having bested Leicester City 8-2 on aggregate in United’s two previous meetings with their visitor, Ruben Amorim’s side were what they are near-constantly under him: seriously disjointed. Introducing the jet-heeled Alejandro Garnacho at the break transformed United’s fortune as he was key to Zirkzee’s strike. But United had diced with being eliminated by Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s first-half goal against opponents with 12 fewer points and candidates for relegation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/07/manchester-united-leicester-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chairman Nigel Travis welcomes the Premier League champions in the FA Cup with grand plans for the future</p><p>“I remember going to Maine Road in 1964 with my dad and we got walloped six-nothing,” recalls Nigel Travis. “I think it’s the only time I’ve ever seen us play them.” The Leyton Orient chairman’s account of watching his club face Manchester City is rare among fans of the League One team – the teams have not met since a second-tier 2-2 draw in 1966. Fortunes have diverged since but Orient welcome City to east London on Saturday in upbeat mood and at something of a crossroads.</p><p>After seven and a half years of steady upward progress since Travis’s consortium took over a club in ruins after relegation to the National League, the chairman has been soliciting fresh investment. A new stadium nearby is being considered and talk has been afoot of aping their former lower division London rivals and “doing a Brentford”.

<p>The prime minister was coached for five years before entering No 10 – he’s not the only high-profile politician who has had support</p><p>What makes a politician an effective public speaker? We may not immediately know the answer, but we know it when we (don’t) see it. Monotone pitch, strangulated vowels or swivel-eyed certainty – these are the people telling us that difficult days lie ahead, or that only their party can deliver a better future. It would be nice if they seemed a bit more normal while they did it.</p><p>The good news is, they can get better at it – just ask Keir Starmer.

<p>Former Spice Girl hosts work by some of biggest names of 20th and 21st century at London fashion store</p><p>A customer in the Victoria Beckham flagship store in Mayfair in London looks astutely up at a Richard Prince painting. The untitled work by the American artist depicts four figures in bold acrylic and oil, and is estimated to be worth up to $600,000 (£480,000). “Richard Prince reinvented himself during every decade of his career; he always challenged himself to do something completely different,” Haleigh Stoddard, Sotheby’s head of contemporary curations, says.</p><p>It’s a description that’s entirely befitting of Beckham herself.

Joseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 among the rakes, beggars and other Georgian caricatures of London’s Covent Garden where his father kept a barber’s shop. In the 21st century, there seems to be a consensus that he was our greatest artist. Remainers and Reform voters, Mike Leigh and the Bank of England all agree. Everyone loves Mr Turner.</p><p>Well, almost everyone. There have always been holdouts.

And as director of Birmingham Royal Ballet, he is trying to make it bigger than ever – even in the face of brutal cuts and the tragic death of its CEO</p><p>“Gone are the times when you used to just create for your own indulgence,” says Carlos Acosta. Now, when it comes to running a major ballet company, and keeping it afloat, “You have to learn from your audience.”<br><br>
 Acosta has always been a crowd-pleaser, ever since he took the top prize at the famous Prix de Lausanne competition in 1990, the auditorium erupting in cheers at the then 16-year-old Cuban’s Don Quixote solo. He went on to fire up adoring audiences around the world, settling at London’s Royal Ballet for 17 years, but making global guest appearances as one of the few genuine ballet superstars.<br><br>

<p>Afro-textured hair in animation has long been oversimplified, but new algorithms now capture its true form</p><p>For decades, afro-textured hair animation has lagged behind illustrations of straight hairstyles. Renderings of Black characters do not typically represent the plethora of Black hair styles or specific attributes of Black hair: the kink in their strands, the spring in their curls. But now, for the first time ever, researchers have developed algorithms to depict coily, Black hair in computer graphics, a massive step for the portrayal of Black characters.</p><p>The findings have been published in a new study, which will be available to animators worldwide. The study is a collaboration between researchers at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/07/black-hair-animation-technology">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor Holliday Grainger narrates Du Maurier’s dark study of suppressed desire and tragedy</p><p>The story of a shy young bride haunted by the spectre of her&nbsp;older husband’s first wife,&nbsp;Daphne du Maurier’s 1938 masterpiece&nbsp;opens with the immortal line: “Last&nbsp;night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.”</p><p>Manderley is the ancestral Cornish home of widower Maxim de Winter, whom our nameless narrator first meets in Monte Carlo, where she is employed as a ladies’ companion. A brief courtship and marriage follow, with the couple returning to Manderley after their honeymoon. But the flinty, gaslighting housekeeper Mrs Danvers hasn’t got over the death of Rebecca, her last mistress, killed in a sailing accident a year earlier, and so she resolves to make the second Mrs de Winter’s life a misery. She does this by undermining and humiliating her in front of the servants, and reminding her of her predecessor’s effervescence, beauty and ability to run a home.</p> <a href

Both had been recently involved with a female photographer, a European in her 30s or 40s, who disappeared soon after the death.

Collaborators and fans explain her appeal</p><p>Last Sunday’s Grammy awards were a celebration of widely known blue-chip talent: Taylor Swift was there, handing an award to Beyoncé. Shakira performed a medley, as did Sabrina Carpenter, a relatively young star who was pulled into the pop firmament last year. But the first award given out, for best rap album, went to a relative unknown, and it created the kind of star-is-born moment that award shows excel at. Accepting the award for her mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal – beating legends such as Eminem, Future and J Cole – 26-year-old Florida rapper Doechii began to tear up: “I put my heart and soul into this mixtape. I bared my life,” she said. “I dedicated myself to sobriety and God told me that I would be rewarded, and that he would show me <em>just how good it could get</em>.”</p><p>Doechii, born Jaylah Hi

<p>Fragrant and colourful, your future self will thank you for getting these flowering vines started early</p><p>How was your January, did you brave the cold to sow something? I&nbsp;didn’t. But that’s because I made a vow several years ago not to sow seeds in January as it is not the best use of my time. Most things only really get going once the days get longer – of at least equal length to the nights, meaning around the spring equinox on 20 March. Sowing before then, for me at least, means lots of little trays of&nbsp;soil on resting on windowsills and propped under windows on boxes – fussing at a time when I want to be&nbsp;as unfussy as possible.</p><p>There are, however, a couple of plants that break this rule.

<p>A baby washes up in a barrel in this warm-hearted and surprising debut</p><p>Garrett Carr’s debut novel for&nbsp;adults begins in an accomplished storyteller’s hypnotic style. “We were a hardy people, raised facing the Atlantic.

<p>A strange, tender romance starring Bel Powley, and Anthony Mackie fights the ‘giant murder bugs’ who won’t go above 8,000ft in a satisfying end-times thriller</p><p>Joy (Bel Powley) and her partner William (Nick Robinson) live in a closed community run by the faintly sinister Our Friends organisation. All of them take pills that dull the emotions and render them “quite content” with their grey existences. Then one day Joy doesn’t take her dose and all the messy stuff of life descends on her.

<p><strong>(Stoney Lane Records)<br></strong>The Birmingham-born jazz star pays tribute to a master of modern music, with tap-dance rhythms and Heidi Vogel’s vocals adding pep to proceedings</p><p>Few have doubted that African American pianist/composer Thelonious Monk was a genius of modern music, as this album title attests, but the acclaimed 28-year-old Birmingham-born saxophonist Xhosa Cole catches Monk’s wild spirit as well as the legacy of his great compositions.</p><p>Ever since Monk’s emergence among the midnight-jamming subversives of jazz’s revolutionary early-1940s bebop movement, his rhythmically jagged, melodically circuitous music was revered – and even feared – by improvisers. His playing would ascend, only to suddenly stop with a crash or jump a sudden chasm; he would lay harmonic booby-traps that invited escapes in shambling melodic runs. Even the great John Coltrane described missing a Monk chord change as like falling into an empty elevator shaft. But Cole will surp

<p>Retire quietly? The idea filled John with horror. Instead, he and Carlile made his best album in decades. They talk tantrums, mortality – and being tactful with Trump</p><p>By the time Elton John retired from touring in 2023, everyone knew his story. It followed a memoir and a biopic, which cemented the Elton lore: how in 1967 jobbing musician Reg Dwight was given an envelope of Bernie Taupin’s lyrics, forging the greatest songwriting partnership since Lennon and McCartney, a baroque new identity, a rampant hit rate of era-defining albums and the commensurate cocaine addiction. Then came sobriety, an emphatic commitment to funding HIV and Aids treatment, finding love with David Furnish; The Lion King, Candle in the Wind, one of the UK’s first gay marriages, two sons.

<p>The third outing of this dysfunctional love story has taken nine months to get a UK release, but the winner of the Emmy for outstanding comedy series is here – and it’s hugely compelling TV</p><p>To get a handle on the US sitcom’s evolution over the past few decades, look no further than the artform’s highest accolade: the Emmy award for outstanding comedy series. Until the mid 00s, wisecrack-heavy domestic crowd-pleasers (Friends, Frasier, Seinfeld) tended to scoop the prize. Then came the cringe, with mockumentaries (The Office, Modern Family) and workplace satires (30 Rock, Veep) taking over. The 2020s, however, have seen the award undergo something of an identity crisis. After the saccharine dramedy Ted Lasso triumphed two years on the trot, the gong was given to The Bear, an emotionally haunting series about a grieving Chicago chef that many believe is categorically Not a Comedy – including Emmy hosts Dan and Eugene Levy, who made a gag to that effect during the 2024 ceremony

<p>With the rise of hair transplants, many men are opting out of baldness. But why is it so hard to accept this natural part of ageing? <strong>Stuart Heritage</strong> and <strong>Rudi Zygadlo</strong> explain</p><p>Once, <strong>Stuart Heritage’s</strong> head was covered in thick, golden, shiny hair. But then, when he was in his early 20s, he noticed a small patch of scalp showing through. At first he tried a hair regrowth treatment, but it didn’t make much difference. As this patch grew, he began brushing his hair over the bald area. Before he knew it, he says, he was horrified to find he was sporting a combover. “Going bald is horrible,” he says ruefully.</p><p>Once you have accepted this loss, however, and that it means you are ageing, actually “being bald is fine”. And not just fine – commonplace. He tells <strong>Helen Pidd</strong> that about 55% of Caucasian men aged over 75 will have experienced some hair loss. Which is why bald heads used to be ubiquitous in popular cultu

Manchester United won the first two with an aggregate of 8-2, Ruud van Nistelrooy was interim manager for each, then Ruben Amorim made the Dutchman unemployed when taking over as the head coach in mid-autumn. Now returning to Old Trafford as Leicester’s No 1, Van Nistelrooy can expect a warm welcome due to his former status as a star United striker. But if he engineers a knockout of the holders, Van Nistelrooy will be recast, temporarily, as the villain of the faithful. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p><p><em>Manchester United v Leicester, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)</em></p><p><em>Leyton Orient v Manchester City, Saturday 12.15pm</em></p><p><em>Coventry v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm</em></p><p><em>Everton v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/07/fa-cup-fourt
