Or, rather, it only connects to ports on the same host (as in, <code>user@hostA: telnet hostA 1234</code> works, while <code>user@hostB: telnet hostA 1234</code> doesn&#39;t).

My cluster has been running fine for a while, but today I realized I was having issues. </p> <p>I have three nodes each with their own IP address. I used to be able to go to any node&#39;s IP, enter the port, and would be redirected to the application, regardless of which node it was running on (example I could access an application running on node 3 by navigating to node 1 and the port of the application).</p> <p>Tonight I realized that&#39;s no longer the case. My containers are only accessible using the IP of the node they&#39;re running on. I stopped all my containers, removed all the nodes from the swarm, then remade the swarm, and still the same thing. I did not do any network pruning after breaking down the swarm, so it is possible my overlay network is jacked and it carried into the new one. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t tweak much as it worked.

I&#39;m trying to create an image that has a mosquitto server with a self-signed certificate so I can connect to it from devices on my local network (ESP32) over SSL/TLS (e.g. with MQTTS). The container runs on Windows 11 (WSL 2 backend host). As I want to be able to teach this content, I&#39;d like the image to be able to run on any (supported) host OS.</p> <p>The issue, it seems, is that when it comes to signing the certificate, I have to provide a Common Name (CN) that matches my hostname so that clients (ESP32) can verify the server&#39;s certificate. </p> <p>As Windows does not like to play nicely with --network=host, &quot;localhost&quot; seems to refer to the Docker (e.g. in WSL) network only (not my Windows box). I&#39;d rather not assign a static IP address or run a full DNS server. I&#39;ve tried running mDNS (avahi), but it does not seem to broadcast outside of the container.</p> <p>I",
