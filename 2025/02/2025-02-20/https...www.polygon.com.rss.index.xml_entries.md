At that time, there was an uncertain future for Bond: Amazon wanted more (lots more — including spinoffs and cinematic universes), and Bro

My very first favorite video game was <em>Ken Griffey Jr.’s Slugfest </em>for the Nintendo 64, and the game franchise I’ve logged the most hours in (by far) is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/520676/football-manager-25-canceled">Football Manager</a> series, with nearly 5,000 combined hours over about 10 years of titles.
