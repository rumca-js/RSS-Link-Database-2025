<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, this is my workflow for learning a new tool:</p> <p>Read basic docs -&gt; Start development -&gt; Search relevant features in doc if need arises</p> <p>I am developing a tool that can convert any online documentation to a chatbot, in my head this biggest benefits would be:</p> <ol> <li>Instantly find features for their use cases</li> <li>Summarize the basics of the tool.</li> <li>Code for them</li> </ol> <p>Would you pay a <strong>MONTHLY</strong> subscription for this kind of tool ($20-$30)? Or would it <strong>NOT</strong> be much of an improvement than using docs as is?</p> <p>What would your most common prompt be?</p> <p>Note: This post is only a means of idea validation, not promotional by any means.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Appropriate-Grade719"> /u/Appropriate-Grade719 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1iu6h6l/documentation_chatbot_documentati
