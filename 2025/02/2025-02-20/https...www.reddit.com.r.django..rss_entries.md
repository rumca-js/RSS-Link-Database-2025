<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve done quite a few things trying to get a site approved for ads and nothing seems to work. The verification is successful in all three methods ads.txt, meta tag, code script. The site has original content, no longer ‚Äúin construction‚Äù or with ipsum texts. I did not add the codes in dead pages such as login or alert screens. I lastly checked if maybe some of the security settings could be affecting but they none is blocking google. And my robots specifically allow Google crawlers. Running out of ideas. Would appreciate any thoughts. If you want to check the site feel free.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yeurymel"> /u/yeurymel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://sombreros-ole.com">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iu93ju/any_tips_to_get_a_django_site_approved_for_google/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Coming from the enterprise world, I am used to just spinning up an AWS RDS instance (or similar) for a project to use as a database. The nice thing about that is they have all the backups, metrics and everything nicely done for you. But for a personal project or micro SaaS, paying even $20 per month for a micro instance seem excessive to me.</p> <p>I heard some people go as simple as using a sqlite in a small project. I was also thinking just a VPC where I have Django and Postgres in docker-compose. Naturally I can make my own backups from the docker instance. But using postgres in docker-compose just feels a bit &quot;flying blind&quot; sort of thing as I do not have metrics.</p> <p>But in an optimal situation I would have the following: - cheap - some way to visualize if database performance is a bottleneck - possibility to grow the instance to give it better performance if user count grows</p> <p>Any recommendations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone.</p> <p>I am pretty unfamiliar with mail technical details, SMTP stuff. I am provided with a small challenge in my company.</p> <p>My django app use <code>django.core.mail.send_mass_mail</code> to send mail to an mail server of another department which then transfer the mails to their recipient. However, we can be temporary blacklisted by that mail server if we send it too many mail (~60/minutes). This can be solved by buffering since we are ok by delaying emails by a few hours. My best bet was to find a django library to buffer emails but I haven&#39;t found anything.</p> <p>Not finding anything can mean that :<br/> - There is a need for an open source project.<br/> - Either my interpretation of the problem or proposed solution are wrong. (e.g. buffering should be done by the SMTP server somehow)<br/> - My problem is niche enough that there is not really any need for that open source project. I can solve this with some homebrewed code. <
