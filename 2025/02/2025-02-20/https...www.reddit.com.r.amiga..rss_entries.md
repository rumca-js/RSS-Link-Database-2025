<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>Looking to replay Wings (1990) I loaded up original roms in the latest WinUAE version (Win 11), downloaded a scan of the manual and started the game. And i have a REALLY hard time loading save files.</p> <p>Everytime I try to load a save file, the game asks for a word from the manual (page 3, paragrath 2, line 3, word 9 etc.) and 99 times out of 100 the game tells me ‚Äùincorrect‚Äù and I need to try again. One (1!) time I actually managed to enter the correct word, but stupid me didn‚Äôt save stated it and I haven‚Äôt manage to succeed after that. I even found an incompete code list, but even when I happened to match an inquiry with an entry on the (incomplete) list the game still tells me it‚Äôs wrong.</p> <p>Anyone got any idea? </p> <p>I‚Äôve tried a mix of all lower case, all uppercase, as-is, but no success.</p> <p>I don‚Äôt really wanna try the cracked version since there is a game breaking bug near the end, and the PC version remake on GOG.com h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Many years ago now I was the proud owner of an Amiga 1200 and frequently picked up various games through magazines and stores. I distinctly remember a puzzle platformer game I had a demo of from some magazine or other, that had an adventure theme to it, but was drawn in a mini pixel art style similar to lemmings at the time. The playable character was probably made of 5 or 6 stacked pixels, and the platforms and monsters and such that you had to navigate or avoid tended to be visible across a single screen where you could plan out your route from your starting point and the exit was clearly visible.</p> <p>For the life of me I can&#39;t remember the name of the game, even though it&#39;s something I&#39;d dearly love to revisit. I wonder if any of the experienced Amiga gamers out there might know its name?</p> <p>I vaguely recall that each level had it&#39;s own theme, so there was the inevitable Aztec theme, probably a snowy landscape as well.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The poor guy had been tinkered with more badly than well. First it had a recap and a cleaning. Some soldering points were torn out of the circuit board or were wobbling. The first functional test was OK. It has already been given new black keycaps. Next up are RGB2HDMI, piStorm and 1MB chip. After the repair I will paint the case black satin. I will save myself the trouble of getting a new KickROM as I can load it from the piStrom. In the end it will run with AmiKit and will be purely for workbench and sound. I still have the A1200 for gaming.</p> <p>This is what it looks like...another A600 back to life.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Attackwave"> /u/Attackwave </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iu8u7t">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iu8u7t/amiga_600_a300_v1_back_2_life/">[comments]</a></span>
