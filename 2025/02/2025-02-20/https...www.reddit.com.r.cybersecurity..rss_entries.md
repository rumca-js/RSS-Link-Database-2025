TAccording to the researchers, this ransomware attack was delivered using ShadowPad and PlugX- two notorious backdoor malware strains often associated with Chinese espionage activities. The intruders exploited a vulnerability in Check Point Security Gateways (CVE-2024-24919) that had already been patched in May 2024.</p> <p>While NailaoLocker encrypted files, it&#39;s considered unsophisticated and poorly designed - suggesting it wasn&#39;t necessarily meant for full encryption or causing extensive damage. However, it still managed to disrupt operations in the sector, where data protection is critical. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -

Then they cut our budget and take away 50% of our tools and staff. In the following 1 to 2 years we will experience a data breach of some kind and will be asked how we could have stopped it. Then we&#39;ll be given millions to beef up our security with modern controls, but we won&#39;t be given the time or the staff to fully and properly roll out the new controls. Then we will limp along till we get into a decent position before the cycle begins again. </p> <p>I&#39;ve done security in Finance, Healthcare, and Government, and I go through the same damn cycle.

## Google SecOps vs Sentinel for Azure monitoring

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My company is looking into evaluating both Google SecOps and Sentinel as a SIEM/SOAR solution for our Azure and 365 environment along with a small handful of on-prem assets. I have some experience with Sentinel and zero with Google SecOps, so thought I&#39;d pose the question to the pros out here that have used both to monitor their Azure and what they like or dislike about the competing platforms. I don&#39;t want to lean to Sentinel just because I&#39;m more familiar with it if there&#39;s compelling reasons to look at SecOps as a viable alternative.
