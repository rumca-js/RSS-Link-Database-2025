Having seen a man in the crowd whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/18/emma-raducanu-karolina-muchova-dubai-coco-gauff-mccartney-kessler-tennis\">off-court behaviour had already concerned her</a>, she was doing the sensible thing and reporting it. The Daily Mail reported that she was \u201creduced to cowering behind the umpire\u2019s chair\u201d.

The income from the rental property in Lewisham is effectively Hajaj\u2019s pension, which he uses to pay for her care.</p><p>So, when a manager from Imperial Property Group contacted Hajaj about his Gumtree listing, Hajaj arranged to meet them.
