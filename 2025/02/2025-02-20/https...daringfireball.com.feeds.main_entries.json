The shock announcement\u2009\u2014\u2009which is sure to shake\nand, indeed, stir the industry\u2009\u2014\u2009was made Thursday, alongside the\nnews that long-time producers and custodians of 007, Michael G.\nWilson and Barbara Broccoli, would be stepping back.</p>\n\n<p>As per details of the historic agreement, Amazon MGM Studios,\nWilson and Broccoli have formed a new joint venture to house the\nJames Bond intellectual property rights. The three parties will\nremain co-owners of the iconic franchise but Amazon MGM will have\ncreative control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The villains in Bond stories are often bald billionaire industrialists who either build rockets or own media companies, with lasciviously-dressed women on their arms. It\u2019s hard to imagine how we could come closer to a real-life Bond villain taking control of the franchise. (At least it wasn\u2019t Musk.)</p>\n\n<p>",
