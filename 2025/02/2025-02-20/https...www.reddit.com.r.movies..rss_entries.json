As a kid, I was convinced the more I read books I\u2019d eventually gain powers like her lol. Now as an adult reading is one of my favorite things to do during my free time. After watching Harriet the spy of course I wanted to be a spy! But it also started my interest in writing and journaling daily. I walked around with composition notebooks like she did and wrote EVERYTHING down. Now as an adult journaling is another norm of my everyday.
