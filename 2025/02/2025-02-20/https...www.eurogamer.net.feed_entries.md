## Solasta 2 is perfectly poised to fill a Baldur's Gate 3 void

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wishlisted-solasta-2.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I'm quietly amazed by Solasta 2. Here's a Dungeons & Dragons role-playing experience like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that actually seems on a par with Baldur's Gate 3, for a change. The clarity with which French studio Tactical Adventures has transposed the hefty Dungeons & Dragons ruleset is astonishing; I actually prefer parts of this interpretation, which is a hell of a thing to say, given the quality of Larian's game. And I don't say that to foster an air of competition, but to stress how accomplished this is.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solasta-2-is-perfectly-poised-to-fill-a-baldurs-gate-3-void">Read more</a></p>

It's a game that's less interested in doing something radical with the structure - this is a pretty straight-ahead, sword-n-spells, skill-and-dialogue-tree action adventure - than it is the sheer vividity of its delivery.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-modest-ambition-with-avowed-is-just-what-game-pass-xbox-and-the-wider-industry-needs-but-will-microsoft-let-them-stick-to-it">Read more</a></p>
