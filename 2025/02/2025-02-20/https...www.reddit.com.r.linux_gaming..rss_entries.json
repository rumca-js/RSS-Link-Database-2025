While on a desktop I was running Windows + Debian WSL. At some point I decided to ditch Windows fully on my PC and go with linux. Went with Garuda, and everything worked fine. But, recently I have seen some issues pop up regarding GPU utilization, and games using way more VRAM, than they were supposed to. For example games such as Forza Horizon 4, run terrible with annoying stutters and low framerate (no matter which graphical settings, I have used). I&#39;ve also enabled mangohud, and tried to analyse it. From what I have seen GPU utilization was almost nothing (only up to 60%). Similar issue was with Far Cry New Dawn, where the game used way too much VRAM even on low settings (3.2 GBs), ofc the stutters and frame dips were there as well. Now, I have played all those games on the same PC, but with windows and I was able to play without any problems on higher setti",

He was playing Geometry Dash, Subnautica, and a bunch of others without issue. This was on Ubuntu 22.04. I upgraded to 24.04 and it has basically stopped working.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried all the different nvidia drivers (550, 570, 470, 535) and nothing has helped. I&#39;ve tried nvidia settings and force composition pipeline and force full composition pipeline. I&#39;ve set nvidia-drm.modeset=1 inside grub. I&#39;ve tried both wayland and x11.</p> <p>But, no matter what I try I have constant screen tearing. Many of the games launch barely, but are unusable, and have screen tearing as well. Some of the games basically hang the computer and I need to kill -9 steam. I&#39;ve tried using a different set of proton versions (experimental and hotfix) but those don&#39;t seem to help. I&#39;m frustrated. I don&#39;t know if there is some magic combination",
