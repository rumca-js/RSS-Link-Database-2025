Elden Ring Nightreign Gameplay Analysis - Nightfarer (Classes) DEEP DIVE
In this Elden Ring Nightreign video, we're going to be doing a little bit of a deep dive into the Nightfarers of Elden Ring Nightreign. In this video, I want to talk about my experience having played each of these characters. I completed a successful run on each of these characters, and i kind of want to go through what I like about these classes, what I don't like about them, and if there are any changes that I think need to be made for the full version of the game.
