        "description": "It doesn\u2019t seem so long ago that co-operative gaming was reduced to a niche mode, an afterthought of game developers looking to shoehorn extra ways to play into their games rather than building their experiences specifically around working together. \n\nIn 2025, after a few years\u2019 renaissance, co-operative gaming is firmly back in favour. Working in teams with others, after all, is always a blast, even more so if they\u2019re sat on the sofa with you. \n\nThis year could be the best offering for co-operative gaming ever, with a raft of two, three, or four player games coming from big name developers. Some are local only, most feature online co-op, but all are worth grabbing the controller together.",

        "description": "Despite Assassin\u2019s Creed forgoing its stealth-orientated roots for the RPG reboots Origins and Odyssey reception of these games was generally quite favourable. Thus, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla \u2013 coming on the cusp of a new console generation \u2013 garnered heaps of promise, plus a healthy dose of trepidation. \n\nVikings, after all, aren\u2019t assassins. However, despite Valhalla harbouring something of an identity crisis the game functions quite well as an open world action adventure if not a stealth-orientated game. However, divisive efforts towards historical realism did bring problems which we\u2019ll discuss at length in this video alongside story related issues (hint: it\u2019s ginormous length and the usual Ubisoft bloat). \n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is not a bad game by any stretch, but the jury is still out on whether it\u2019s a good Assassin\u2019s Creed game.",
