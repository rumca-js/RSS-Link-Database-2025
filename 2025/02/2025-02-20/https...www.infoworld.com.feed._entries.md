<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336982/apollo-graphql-debuts-graphos-platform-for-building-supergraphs.html">Apollo GraphQL</a>, provider of the GraphOS API orchestration platform, has introduced <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/graphos/apollo-connectors">Apollo Connectors</a> for REST APIs, a way to integrate REST APIs into a composable GraphQL architecture without writing boilerplate code. The company also announced GraphOS platform enhancements. </p>



<p>These latest releases from Apollo GraphQL offer a declarative approach to API orchestration that allows teams to orchestrate APIs for maximum efficiency, the company said. Teams using Apollo Connectors can adopt declarati

<p>There’s a race going on. Not the one to build artificial general intelligence, whatever that may be, but to deliver the first at-scale <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3574488/what-is-quantum-computing-solutions-to-impossible-problems.html">quantum computer</a> that’s able to solve a class of massive problems that would take far too long using even the most powerful supercomputer.</p>



<p>Building a quantum computer requires devices that can work at temperatures close to absolute zero, where it’s possible to set, observe, and measure the quantum states of subatomic particles and use those measurements as part of a complex analog computer. More importantly, we need a way to ensure th
