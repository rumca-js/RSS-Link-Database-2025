<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I work with teenagers, and it is very common for them to express interest in joining the military after high school. Our culture pushes this path as valuable and valorous, with little to no encouragement for young people to consider the motivations behind our current wars. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am the daughter of a Vietnam War veteran and am also descended from veterans of the Korean War.

In a historical moment when military service is not conscripted, individuals bear responsibility for their decision to participate in unjust wars.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Indie authors are even better. The style I&#39;m looking for is authors who can write grit, suspense, and darkness, but, also, like <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, can tie in deeper philosophical themes that give the books a more layered experience. Like in <em>No Country,</em> on the surface, you have a relentless killer chasing a thief, and an investigation by a sheriff. But under the surface, you have a meditation on the collapsing ethics and sense of morality of the old ways in the face of a colder changing world. And, how death is an unstoppable force that doesn&#39;t wait for man&#39;s watch. It&#39;s not just a crime novel, it&#39;s a philosophical battle wrapped up in the story.

I’m open to Orwell’s other works, but was wondering if anyone has suggestions for those or something else. For fiction, I also really like things weird/macabre. I started Bram Stoker’s Dracula but the journal entries/letters were a little boring for me honestly.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering, have you read any acknowledgment sections of books that stood out to you? I usually skim through them, as they feel separate from the books themselves. But I&#39;d love to see some examples of acknowledgments that made an impact on you and maybe added to your enjoyment of the book. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nickellee"> /u/nickellee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1itm58m/acknowledgement_sections_worth_reading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1itm58m/acknowledgement_sections_worth_reading/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>My boyfriend never reads books but told me that he would like to start reading. He asked me to get him a few books that I think he would like. However, the books I read (YA books with a strong woman protagonist) might not be 100% his thing. </p> <p>Please suggest easy reads, relatively short and captivating. Books that keep your attention from pretty early on and are fast paced.</p> <p>So please give me some book suggestions for him!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m not hip enough to post on <a href="/r/Books">r/Books</a> so I brought my question here in the hope that some reader out there had any insight.</p> <p>Reading ‘The Plot Against America’ right now as my first Roth novel. Loving it so much at the 1/3 mark that I’m already planning my next foray into his oeuvre. ‘American Pastoral’ and the so-called “American Trilogy” seemed like a logical next step at first, but now I’m learning that that trilogy is actually the 6th-9th books centered around his Nathan Zuckerberg character. Will reading the American trilogy spoil the “Zuckerman Bound” books? Or should I not sweat it and dive into ‘American Pastoral’ before come back to the previous Zuckerman books at a later date?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kidCoLa_34"> /u/kidCoLa_34 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1itl8x4/philip_roths_american_trilogy_should_i_wa
