Too bad watching the games can still be an ordeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, Major League Baseball has yet to rally its teams behind a cohesive strategy for streaming local ballgames. While some teams are partnering with the league on distribution, others are going their own way, working with regional sports networks, or clinging to expensive pay TV bundles. Factor in all the nationally-televised games scattered across cable networks and streaming services, and there\u2019s a lot for baseball fans to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I\u2019ve done with the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2491836/every-nba-streaming-option-in-one-place.html\">NBA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2469379/nhl-streaming-options-untangling-the-2024-2025-mess.html\">NHL</a>, ",

Whether it\u2019s a picture of the Pope sporting a puffy Balenciaga jacket or Trump getting tackled and arrested, these AI-generated images appear super realistic (as long as you\u2019re not looking too close), so it can be hard to separate fact from fiction. This is because AI doesn\u2019t really understand context in the cultural or historical sense. While some AI-generated images are harmless and do not spread misinformation, others, especially ones involving celebrities or politicians, can cause a great deal of damage and brain rot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heck, I consider myself to be a relatively tech-savvy person and even I\u2019ve been fooled once or twice. We\u2019re already in an era where even political leaders use AI images in misleading or emotion-provoking ways, so it\u2019s good to be able to identify whether what you\u2019re look",

It also packs some extra features that are hard to find in this price range, like USB-C video support with 98 watts of power delivery for gaming monitors.
