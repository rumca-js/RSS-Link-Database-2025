        "description": "Chip 'n Clawz vs. The Brainiods's jokey tone, combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons, reminded us a lot of the Overcooked series, which uses its seemingly simple mechanics and cheery art to disguise the friendships it will surely ruin in the coming hours. Similarly, Chip \u2018n Clawz cleverly disguises its difficulty by being one of the most immediately approachable RTS games we\u2019ve played, luring you into a false sense of security with its third-person action mechanics, but then hilariously kicks you in the face with demanding levels that require you to lean more and more into its complicated RTS mechanics a short time later.

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nEx-PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida heaped some praise on Naughty Dog's canceled The Last of Us live service game, but also gave a quick explanation as to why it was canned. According to Yoshida, developer Bungie explained to Sony what it really takes to make and run a live service title, and Sony decided to spend the resources elsewhere. In other news, Xbox's Phil Spencer seemingly concedes Xbox's place in the current Console Wars. Via an interview with XboxEra, Spencer says the company realizes the value of not trying to move gamers from other platforms to Xbox, and instead embrace trying to get their games played by the widest audience. And speaking of Xbox, Wave of February's Game Pass games have been revealed.",
