I\u2019ve heard of lawyers doing AI training on a part-time basis and was wondering if there are any similar opportunities out there. I\u2019m also looking into doing a digital nomad lifestyle and that\u2019s why I wanted to do something that\u2019s manageable remotely and not too fussy with physical presence like most legal jobs.

One thing I&#39;ve noticed even with my own smart devices is it absolutely cannot tell when you are talking to it and when you are not. It just listens to everything once it&#39;s initiated.
