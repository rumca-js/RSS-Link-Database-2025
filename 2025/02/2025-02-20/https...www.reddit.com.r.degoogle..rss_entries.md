<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is a good place for my post, because although I would like to keep using YouTube, I would like to access it in a way that is a bit more private than the app, but I simply cannot figure out how to make it possible to zoom in on a video in full screen mode in any browser.</p> <p>If it&#39;s possible, I&#39;d like to achieve this in Brave or Firefox, or any of their Beta/Nightly versions. If I have to download any other browser, I&#39;d prefer it to be open source, and fairly privacy-conscious. I saw some browsers suggested (like UC Browser and Soul Browser), but I don&#39;t know if I can trust them. (I also tried Samsung Internet, but the built-in video player doesn&#39;t seem to work on YouTube, neither does Force enable zoom in Brave.)</p> <p>So is there anything I can do to these browsers (like an add-on or a user script), or maybe a way to automatically/easily open youtube videos in an external player, where I can zoom in?

Transitioned to Firefox and it was easier than expected.</p> <p>Not only that, but it runs SMOOTH AS HELL, it is snappy af even on my crappy laptop. I am so damn ecstatic. Thank you Google for blasting yourself in the crotch with a bazooka and forcing my lazy ass to finally crawl out of the dumpster.</p> <p>One final thing that has always bothered me about Chrome is the mfers on Reddit that would come out of the woodworks with insane walls of text dying on a hill to defend it whenever I would complain about its performance.</p> <p>Thei
