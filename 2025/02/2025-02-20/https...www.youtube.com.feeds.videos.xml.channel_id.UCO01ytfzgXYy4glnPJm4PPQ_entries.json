        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the airline that just flipped upside down on a runway in Toronto has been obsessed with DEI for many years. They seem to have been more focused on \u201cgirl power\u201d than on keeping their planes in the sky. Also, the Trump administration might ban food stamp recipients from using taxpayer money to buy junk food. Why isn\u2019t that already the policy? The mayor of Los Angeles says she needs to investigate to figure out why she decided to leave for Africa right before the wildfires broke out. And a new debate is raging on social media: is it sexist for a dad to take just his son on a guy\u2019s trip? The internet says yes. And the internet is wrong again.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:33 Opening\n01:46 - 22:06 Girlbossing the Airline Industry\u2026 Straight Into the Ground\n23:16 - 30:31 USDA Looks To Ban The Ability To Buy Junk Food On Food Stamps\n30:32 - 34:27 Liberals Perform Odd Dance At Kennedy Center In Protest Of Trump\n34:28 - 43:32 Karen Bass Desperately Tries To Explain Why",
