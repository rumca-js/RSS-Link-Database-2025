<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. Hopefully this post is allowed. </p> <p>I do admin work and I put together this data heavy set of reports weekly. The data comes from primarily two websites (Altametrics which is used amongst many companies, and LCE Gateway which is Little Caesars specific). They report from our POS system in our stores (restaurant franchise). The tedious part is that we have 49 locations now and I have to pull many of the metrics one store at a time with the given reports available in those websites. It takes me quite a while even after getting quick at it and creating an automated Excel file to fill the reports from a dataset. </p> <p>Can a programmer help to automate this? Does this seem like a difficult task? I really don&#39;t know. What kind of cost range might be associated with this project? </p> <p>Thank you in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/catsnhippies"> /u/catsnhippies </a> <br/> <
