<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, I started reading the cycle on the Dark Tower. As I understand it, when King started this series of books, he was inspired by Westerns and classic fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings.</p> <p>Only the tip of the iceberg is known about the world of this series, but it&#39;s already interesting how King will develop it. There are billions upon billions of worlds and universes, and they all intersect in one place. In the Dark Tower.</p> <p>In the story, Roland chases the man in black through a strange desert-like world.</p> <p>Not to say that the plot is dynamic, although there are such moments, for example, the first chapter, where Roland visits a town that the man in black has visited, but for the most part Ronald and Jake (the boy he meets in the second chapter) just follow in the footsteps of the man in black, with moments when Roland remembers his world. And it doesn&#39;t boring, because the book is short, only 280-something pages. But in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Liveship Traders has cemented Robin Hobb as my favorite author.</p> <p>I loved Farseer and while Fitz remains my favorite fantasy genre protagonist, I have to say that The Liveship Traders takes things to a whole other level. </p> <p>The Cursed Shore was such a wonderful setting and the multiple character PoVs elevated the reading experience. With almost every character I rode the waves of emotion alongside them, their journeys, struggles, setbacks and ambitions were captivating. I can&#39;t think of a single character that was wasted, Hobb is a master of making you empathize with the most vile characters.</p> <p>The hallmark of good fiction for me is if I&#39;m left with a greater understanding of myself and others. It should leave me with lingering questions and ideas long after turning the final page. For me there is no better author than Robin Hobb at doing these things. </p> <p>I&#39;m so excited to continue this journey with The Tawny Man.<

It starts with <strong>Bodyhoppers</strong> by Roc√≠o Vega, translated by Sue Burke, a fast-paced cyberpunk story featuring a lead trying to carve out a life in a world where mere access to a physical body is a marker of privilege. It opens with the theft of a body and moves quickly from there, with the lead always trying to stay a step ahead of law enforcement. It provides just enough backstory to garner some pathos and offers plenty for fans of propulsive storytelling. </p> <p>Next, Fiona Moore‚Äôs <strong>King

And huge huge kudos to everyone who organizes it and makes it possible, you do a stellar job. </p> <p>All that said, the rule where you can only count one book by a given author seems overly limiting. I totally understand that one of the main points of bingo is to expand our reading, get out of comfort zone, etc. And to that end, obviously it would be silly to have 10 squares all by the same author. But what if there was a middle-ground, and we were allowed to do even just 2 squares by the same author? Especially for this genre, there are so many series. Each year I find myself torn between my

## What are the best works of fantasy that show how the protagonists make a new start for themselves after their quest/adventure/mission is over?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now we all like to read or watch stories about heroes going on an quest/adventure/mission. Whether it&#39;s a soldier or a spy fighting a war, an explorer making new discoveries, an adventurer making rediscoveries, or a mercenary or private investigator catching the bad guy we all enjoy these characters doing what they do whether its kicking butt, saving lives, solving complex problems, and outwitting their enemies.</p> <p>But after watching Monsieur Slade, it got me thinking. What happens when the heroes are too tired to do any of this anymore? What happens to them when they are spent mentally, physically, or both? Or better yet, once there are no more battles to fight, no more new or old discoveries to make, or no more bad guys to catch what will they do then? How will they be able to move on from their &quot;Life of adventure&quot;?</p> <p>In any case are there any works of science fiction and fantasy that show the protagonists making a new start 

## What's up with all these "buxom mages" books lately? Is this a whole new genre?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking to cash in an Audible credit or two and found a couple books with, well... startling covers. There&#39;s Rogan&#39;s &quot;Primal Conjurer&quot; series, and Thorne&#39;s &quot;Hearthomancy&quot; series. The first is a coming-of-age magical academy series, and the second is a &quot;Earth becomes magical&quot; scenario. </p> <p>Not exactly the same, right? Just... the descriptions &amp; reviews make these series both seem like a cross between adventure and some kind of romance anime, and the cover pictures featuring heroines with &quot;extremely good posture&quot; make me unsure if these are bodice-ripper fantasies with some adventure, or adventures with some know-wot-I-mean-squire.</p> <p>Am I wrong to see similarities here? Do we have some kind of new genre going on? Can I read these books without needing to fan myself?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/akaioi"> /u/akaioi </a> <br/> <
