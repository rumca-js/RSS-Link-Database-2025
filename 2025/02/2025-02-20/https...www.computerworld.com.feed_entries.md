<p>Google and Zoom this week announced new AI features in their videoconferencing apps  that the companies said are aimed at improving employee productivity.</p>



<p>The updates focus on automating tasks during and after a videoconference. </p>



<p>Google Meet now has a feature that advises users on possible next steps to take after a videoconferencing call ends. And Zoom added a new set of AI tools called Workplace Automation that automates common tasks after a meeting.</p>



<p>Google’s “suggested next steps” tool draws its cues from an AI-generated transcript of a meeting and recommends next steps and follow-ups, which are organized within the meeting notes document. </p>

<p>Emerging technologies such as connected transport, quantum sensing, healthcare diagnostics, and synthetic AI-driven content are creating huge gaps in data protection and privacy that could quickly outpace the ability of regulators and enterprises to contain them.</p>



<p>It’s a possibility that emerges from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office’s (ICO’s) latest <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/research-reports-impact-and-evaluation/research-and-reports/technology-and-innovation/tech-horizons-report-2025/">Tech Horizons report 2025</a>, which examines how these four sectors could be about to make today’s understanding of the data security challenge look quaint.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to like about <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1722150/apple-settles-with-qualcomm-the-5g-iphone-looks-more-real-u.html">Apple’s newest $599 iPhone 16e</a>, but one of the more interesting features in the device is the Apple-designed 5G modem. Apple has spent at least seven years developing the chip, but gave it just a few short seconds of time when it announced the smartphone this week. (That’s not a great deal of time for a component that represents such a design challenge.)</p>
