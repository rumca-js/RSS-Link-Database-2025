I expected the AI to basically give me some average of what is written in the media. Europe is in trouble, but everything will come alright. Europe is a fortress of democracy, fighting the good fight and so on, standing proud against anyone who dismisses human rights.</p> <p>That was not the case. Instead, ChatGPT tells me that history is cyclical, every civilisation has its time to fall, and now its Europes time. He openly claims that EU is acting foolish, creating its own troubles. Furthermore, it tells me that European nations are basically US lackeys, just nobody is admitting it openly.</p> <p>I was like &quot;What the hell, where did you learn that?&quot; My understanding of those LLMs is that the just get lotta data from the net, and then feed me the average.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here are novel ideas to tackle each of the seven roadblocks standing in the way of artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are speculative, blending current science with some creative stretches, but they’re aimed at cracking the core issues. Let’s dive in.</p> <pre><code>1 Lack of Generalization Across DomainsIdea: Cross-Domain Knowledge Weaving Network (CKWN)Build a neural architecture where “knowledge threads” (modular sub-networks trained on specific domains like language, vision, or physics) are dynamically woven together by a meta-learning layer. This layer doesn’t just transfer weights—it maps shared abstract concepts (e.g., “sequence” in text and time) across domains using a universal embedding space. Train it on a “conceptual playground”—a simulated environment with diverse, unlabeled tasks—forcing it to infer connections without domain-specific data. Think of it as teaching the AI to fish for principles, not just eat pre-caught fish. 2

OpenAI increased GPT-4’s memory to 32,000 tokens (around 50 pages), and rumors say GPT-5 will handle even more. This could help bots keep track of earlier parts of a chat.</p> <h1>But It’s Still Hard</h1> <ul> <li>Memory Issues – The longer the chat, the more likely AI is to forget or mix up details. Studies show that after about 10 exchanges, chatbots can lose half of the context.</li> <li>Emotion and Tone – AI still struggles with sarcasm, tone, and unspoken cues.</li> <li>Common Sense – While AI spots patterns easily, it’s not great at real-world reasoning or complex problem-solving.</li> </ul> <p>Companies like Retell AI are trying to crack multi-tur

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This paper explores how large language models can perform information extraction (IE) tasks without dedicated training by leveraging their pre-trained knowledge through careful prompting - essentially &quot;free-riding&quot; on their existing capabilities.</p> <p>Key technical aspects: - Uses a prompt-based approach they call &quot;Cuckoo&quot; that guides LLMs to perform IE tasks - Tests multiple prompt templates and strategies across different IE tasks including NER, RE, and event extraction - Evaluates performance against traditional supervised IE methods - Analyzes scaling behavior across model sizes and architectures</p> <p>Main results: - Achieves competitive performance with specialized IE systems on several benchmarks - Shows strong zero-shot capabilities across different extraction tasks - Demonstrates that larger models generally perform better at IE tasks - Identifies prompt design patterns that work well for different types of extraction<

## Use of AI in my economics class at university, is this our future?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently taking an economics class at a local university (back in school after 15 years)<br/> The classes are online and you have all week to submit all of the hw/test/classwork.<br/> I am spending about 20-30 hours per week between the reading, research, classwork, etc.</p> <p>I am currently feeling defeated. I am able to see the posts that other people make and when I check their posts on multiple AI checkers online, they come back as 80-100% AI written. Leaving just a few of us with original ideas in the class. (maybe about 4 of us are actually doing the work)</p> <p>Here is what is bugging me the most about this. Even the professor responses on my graded work are coming back as 100%. </p> <p>It is as if, the professors pretend to teach and the students pretend to learn. Is this our future?<br/> This makes me feel so scared for the next generation of workers entering the workforce. </p> <p>Have you seen something similar? </p> </div><!-- SC_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Imagine this scenario. A device (like a Google home hub) in your home or a humanoid robot in a warehouse. You talk to it. It answers you. You give it a direction, it does said thing. Your Google home /Alexa/whatever, same thing. Easy with one on one scenarios. One thing I&#39;ve noticed even with my own smart devices is it absolutely cannot tell when you are talking to it and when you are not. It just listens to everything once it&#39;s initiated. Now, with AI advancement I imagine this will get better, but I am having a hard time processing how something like this would be handled. </p> <p>An easy way for an AI powered device (I&#39;ll just refer to all of these things from here on as AI) to tell you are talking to it is by looking at it directly. But the way humans interact is more complicated than that, especially in work environments. We yell at each other from across a distance, we don&#39;t necessarily refer to each other by name, yet we someho

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s crazy to see the directions ai is moving. I don’t think it’ll be terminator style, and I don’t think we’ll have robot maids (unless you’re a rich guy who wants to screw robots and can afford it). I think we’re still a ways away from convincing humanoid robots. I think that slob Musk had people in costume for part of that robot demo, didn’t he? I don’t think the robots were able to function on their own yet. The Boston Dynamics Dog and the drones are the ones I’d worry about. Even worse than that, the bots clogging the internet are able to pass the Turing Test with most people. The propaganda being spread with ai generated images so that powerful people can hoard more power is more horrifying than Terminators. We’re welcoming the tech into our homes. It’s not a fight on a physical. It’s way harder to fight, and Ray Bradbury called it in Fahrenheit 451, when he predicted people will welcome the destruction of culture, because they want easy entert
