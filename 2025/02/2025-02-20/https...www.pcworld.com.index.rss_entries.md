## Baseball streaming in 2025: More options, but more mayhem, too

<p>As winter drags on and Spring Training gets underway, I’m itching to start thinking about baseball again. Too bad watching the games can still be an ordeal.</p>



<p>In 2025, Major League Baseball has yet to rally its teams behind a cohesive strategy for streaming local ballgames. While some teams are partnering with the league on distribution, others are going their own way, working with regional sports networks, or clinging to expensive pay TV bundles. Factor in all the nationally-televised games scattered across cable networks and streaming services, and there’s a lot for baseball fans to think about.</p>



<p>As I’ve done with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2491836/every-nba-streaming-option-in-one-place.html">NBA</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2469379/nhl-streaming-options-untangling-the-2024-2025-mess.html">NHL</a>,

<p>Nowadays, it’s easy to get fooled by AI content on the web. Whether it’s a picture of the Pope sporting a puffy Balenciaga jacket or Trump getting tackled and arrested, these AI-generated images appear super realistic (as long as you’re not looking too close), so it can be hard to separate fact from fiction. This is because AI doesn’t really understand context in the cultural or historical sense. While some AI-generated images are harmless and do not spread misinformation, others, especially ones involving celebrities or politicians, can cause a great deal of damage and brain rot.</p>



<p>Heck, I consider myself to be a relatively tech-savvy person and even I’ve been fooled once or twice. We’re already in an era where even political leaders use AI images in misleading or emotion-provoking ways, so it’s good to be able to identify whether what you’re look

<p>With the Firefox 135.0.1 update for Windows, macOS, and Linux, Mozilla has fixed several security vulnerabilities along with some non-security-related bugs, which include some browser crash issues and problems with browser history after an update.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-12/">Mozilla’s 2025-12 Security Advisory</a> shows only one fixed security vulnerability, but it’s a summarized entry that describes an unspecified number of identical or similar flaws. Mozilla states a “high” risk rating because these vulnerabilities lead to a “potentially exploitable crash.” There are no known attacks on Firefox users that exploit these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>A virtual private network, aka a VPN, is one of the best tools you can use to boost your online privacy and security. It encrypts your traffic and tunnels it through a private server, allowing you to keep your online activities anonymous and hidden from prying eyes.</p>



<p>When looking for the best VPN, you’ll want to consider a few things: First and foremost, does it have a good privacy record; how are its average connection speeds; is it able to effectively and consistently unblock streaming services; and finally, does it have a large enough server network for your location needs? All of my curated picks below deliver these essentials plus more.</p>





<p><strong>Why you should trust me:</strong> Here at PCWorld we’ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. For my own part, I’m continually testing all of the major VPN

<p>If you’re hunting for a good deal on a new OLED monitor, then I suggest waiting for big sales events like Black Friday. But if you can’t wait that long, this refurbished deal on Woot might be a good alternative. Right now, you can snag an MSI 34-inch ultrawide OLED gaming monitor <a href="https://computers.woot.com/offers/msi-34-uwqhd-curved-gaming-monitor-mpg-341cqpx-qd-oled">for just $569.99</a>, which is over $300 off its retail price.</p>



<p>The MPG 341CQPX hits a lot of the same notes as similar ultrawide gaming OLED panels, including a semi-standard 3440×1440 resolution and a faster-than-usual 240Hz refresh rate. It also packs some extra features that are hard to find in this price range, like USB-C video support with 98 watts of power delivery for gaming monitors. It earned an Editors’ Choice award in our PCWorld review, <a href="https://www.pcwo

<p>After making the surprise announcement that several Ring security cameras need only firmware updates to deliver 2K video resolution, Ring has unveiled a new indoor/outdoor model that delivers that capacity on day one. The familiar-looking Ring Outdoor Cam Plus ($99.99) is available for pre-order now and is expected to ship to customers on March 26.</p>



<p>The Ring Outdoor Cam Plus’s signature feature is its 2K resolution (which Ring defines as 2560 x 1440 pixels), but it arrives with a few other new specifications as well. This camera is not in the Ring Spotlight Cam family, so it doesn’t have an onboard light source. Instead, a new feature that Ring calls Low-Light Sight technology uses image-processing techniques to deliver color night vision even in near-dark conditions. Low-Light Sight depends on the presence of at least <em>some </em>ambient light,

<p>Now here’s a clever idea. An outdoor security camera that not only keeps watch over your backyard spaces, but also bathes them in Matter and Zigbee connectivity. </p>



<p>That’s the idea behind <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/camera-hub-g5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aqara’s Camera Hub G5 Pro</a>, a weatherized 4MP security cam with a smart home hub that bridges Zigbee devices and acts a Thread border router for Matter products. </p>



<p>Matter, of course, is the new hotness in smart home, promising to bridge the gaps between Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and the other big smart-home protocols.  </p>



<p>Thanks to Thread, Matter devices can create self-healing networks that can extend throughout the home, but reaching <em>outside </em>your house can still be a tricky task.  </p>

<p>HDMI is a modern standard for the transmission of video tracks and multi-channel audio signals. PC monitors, (smart) TVs or hi-fi and surround systems rely on this reliable and user-friendly technology. The problem with this is that the high-frequency signals can be susceptible to interference, especially with longer cables. </p>



<p>If you connect devices via HDMI cable and hear a humming or buzzing noise, this does not necessarily mean that the hardware is faulty, but you should rule out device damage to be on the safe side. This checklist will help you find the root cause of annoying humming or buzzing with HDMI connections.</p>

<p>Just a decade ago, few people really knew how damaging a sedentary desk job could be for one’s health. From carpal tunnel to herniated discs to muscle aches everywhere, plus the need to mainline tea or coffee all day, it turns out that being an office worker can be seriously bad for personal wellness — and chronic back pain tends to be the worst of it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, unlike in most physical labor jobs that can be literally back-breaking, office workers can make changes and improve habits to reduce the bodily strain that comes from working at a desk. And if you find it hard to incorporate such changes, tech accessories can really help.</p>



<p>After years of tweaks and trying all kinds of supportive gear, my back is much improved. Here are the most helpful gadgets, devices, and tools I continue to use to help thwart back pain while I work.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump said that he expects the U.S. government to impose chip tariffs of 25 percent by April 2, adding to the woes of tech buyers already burdened by high prices. But that’s not all, as Trump said he expects to raise them even more over the course of 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/economy/us-new-tariff-plans-trump-intl-hnk/index.html">Trump was quoted by CNN</a> and other publications, speaking from his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. During the same conversation, Trump said he plans to apply automotive tariffs of 25 percent, plus the same for pharmaceuticals as well.</p>



<p>The idea, apparently, is to push foreign chipmakers to invest in U.S. chip manufacturing, rather than import the semiconductors into the U.S. form foreign factories. “We want to give them a little bit of a chance,” CNN quoted Trump as saying.
