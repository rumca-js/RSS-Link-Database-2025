It was both a gamble and a necessary i",

Not because it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s make or break for a segment of the phone market that never <em>quite</em> took off like manufacturers hoped it would, but because I simply don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know where we go from here. There&acirc;&#128;&#153;s scarcely room to make the phone thinner without ditching USB-C entirely; battery life, performance, and even cameras are now on par with other flagship phones; and this time, Oppo even managed to fit wireless charging and water resistance in, too. This is what we were promised all along. Now what?</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hardware a",
