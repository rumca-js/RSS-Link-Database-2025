There are billions upon billions of worlds and universes, and they all intersect in one place.

And it doesn&#39;t boring, because the book is short, only 280-something pages. But in",

Cue personal reading reflection, eventually resulting in the question I ask at the very bottom of this post.</p> <p>I tend to hold off on reading any reviews of books I&#39;m interested in until after I&#39;ve finished reading said book, because I want to form an opinion that is wholly my own prior to reading what others think of it. The book I just finished last night is <em>Immortal Longings</em> by Chloe Gong (no spoilers), which stays true to a personal interest in sci-fi/dystopian themes, while also deviating from my own norms a bit by being a romance novel as well.</p> <p>I enjoyed the book, it was nothing earth-shattering by any stretch (it&#39;s basically an urban cityscape variation on a <em>Battle Royale/Hunger Games</em> story), but I found it to hold my interest nonetheless and it rests around a 6-6.5/10 or so for me.

Having a degree in Philosophy while loving existential novels, I felt like I could not go wrong. I was left exhausted and bored.

It might be because Im coming straight from The Moviegoer.</p> <p>That said, I was shocked to find out that The Moviegoer beat out Revolutionary Road for the National Book Award in 1962. Not only that. It beat Franny and Zooey and Catch-22. Admittedly, I have not read Franny and Zooey (it has now been moved up next) but Catch-22 was easily a better novel in many ways.</p> <p>How could this have even transpired?

If you are a fan of Rothfuss (Name of the Wind), Weeks (Night Angel Trilogy), or McClellan (Powder Mage Trilogy), you will absolutely love these novels. The storytelling is rich and complicated, the looks into the collision of science and magic incredibly detailed, and Hamrahan&#39;s interpretation of gods and the consequences that arise from them is unique and refreshing. </p> <p>The Black Iron Legacy follows Carillon Thay, a young woman returning to the city of her birth, Guerdon, after running away as a child following her family&#39;s murder.

I really like reading a book, making notes in a notebook and analyzing what type of plot it is, what techniques the author uses to evoke emotions in us, and so on. I can analyze one book for a very long time, my record is 4 months. It was a thriller by Ivanov, the book was judged for anti-communist propaganda. It was terribly interesting. I had no problems with this until my guardian, who is also a bookworm, said that when he reads books, it is more like watching a movie, where the brain imagines it. For me, this was strange, for me, a book is a set of letters that can be analyzed according to different criteria . I just do not enjoy ordinary reading of books, without any analysis. But the idea of \u200b\u200breading without all this is quite interesting. So I want to ask, how to enjoy books without analysis?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
