<p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms.

Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like.

<p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass.

But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Ju

<p>On January 24, the official Twitter account of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> posted a <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1882473505045831837">tweet</a> that I had been looking forward to for years. In it, a man spoke these words: <em>"Walang bansang pinagmumulan ng katalinuhan. Ito ay nagbubunga sa lahat ng lugar. Ito'y parang liwanag at hangin. Ito'y katangian ng lahat."</em> In English, this roughly translates to "genius/intellect is not exclusive to any country. It can blossom anywhere. It is like light and air. It is in all of us."</p><p dir="ltr">Those are the words of Dr. Jose Rizal, accomplished author, scholar, polyglot, and venerated hero of the Philippines. The moment I heard those words, spoken in clear Tagalog--one of the many dialects of my people--I couldn't help but tear up. It wasn't just because the Philippines finally became an official part of the Civilization franchise with Rizal as a p

<p>When I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/overwatch-2-review-same-as-it-ever-was/1900-6417972/">reviewed</a> Overwatch 2 back in 2022, I expressed a sentiment that I would soon hear echoed by peers and players alike; Although Overwatch 2 introduced a handful of solid changes to the critically-acclaimed hero shooter, there was very little there that truly justified the "2" that Blizzard seemed so eager to add. A new, shiny lacquer had been poured atop the game, that much was clear, but beneath its sleek exterior was a game that was largely the same--albeit with more aggressive monetization practices.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past two years, I've held out hope that Blizzard would find some way to once again captivate fans (myself included) and harness the magic that made Overwatch so beloved. Across the game's 14 Seasons, it's abundantly clear that the team has been actively listening to its players and trying. Contentious anti-consumer practices <a href="https://www.gamespot

<p>In a shocking <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond">announcement</a>, Amazon MGM Studios has announced that it is taking over creative control of the James Bond series as part of a deal with series stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

<p dir="ltr">In order to be successful, a controller needs three things: comfort, function, and convenience. There's a reason why the Duke--the notoriously large controller that accompanied the original Xbox in 2001--was eventually replaced with a smaller design, durable as it was. The Duke was heavy and huge, with buttons spread out a little too far across the interface.</p><p dir="ltr">Scuf's newest controller, the Valor Pro Wired Controller for Xbox and PC, nails all three of these elements. Its light weight and smooth front faceplate makes it easy to carry and hold without irritation. The design of the bumpers and triggers on the top of the controller make it very simple to alternate between, while the four rear paddles offer extra control in tight situations. A few other additional features--like built-in audio controls--add additional convenience. It's not reinventing the wheel, but the Valor Pro is a great choice for Xbox and PC players alike, provided you can live with a wire
