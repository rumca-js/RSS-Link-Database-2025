<blockquote>
  <p>Nearly three years after Amazon acquired the right to release Bond
movies through its $6.5 billion purchase of the
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio, the relationship between the family
that oversees the franchise and the e-commerce giant has all but
collapsed. The decaying partnership has scuttled any near-term
hope of a new Bond film — a black eye for Amazon’s ambitions in
Hollywood, since at the time of the MGM sale, the Bond franchise
represented a significant share of the $6.5 billion the company
paid for the studio.</p>

<p>When it comes to Bond’s future, the power lies in the hands of
Barbara Broccoli, who inherited the control from her father,
Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, and who for 30 years has decided when a

<p>Alex Ritman, with blockbuster news at Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon MGM Studios is set to take creative control of the James
Bond franchise. The shock announcement — which is sure to shake
and, indeed, stir the industry — was made Thursday, alongside the
news that long-time producers and custodians of 007, Michael G.
Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, would be stepping back.</p>

<p>As per details of the historic agreement, Amazon MGM Studios,
Wilson and Broccoli have formed a new joint venture to house the
James Bond intellectual property rights. The three parties will
remain co-owners of the iconic franchise but Amazon MGM will have
creative control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The villains in Bond stories are often bald billionaire industrialists who either build rockets or own media companies, with lasciviously-dressed women on their arms. It’s hard to imagine how we could come closer to a real-life Bond villain taking control of the franchise. (At least it wasn’t Musk.)</p>

<h2>The Announcement</h2>

<p>Apple made the announcement in a 13-minute video that is currently atop their  home page, but seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg">only perma-linkable at YouTube</a>.
