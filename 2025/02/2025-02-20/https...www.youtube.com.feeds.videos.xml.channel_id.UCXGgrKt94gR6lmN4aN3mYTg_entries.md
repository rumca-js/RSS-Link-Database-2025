I got exclusive access to witness history as Boom's XB-1 aircraft achieved supersonic flight for the first time. In this video, I explore how this small company is working to bring back faster-than-sound passenger travel, touring their incredible test aircraft and getting hands-on with their simulators. What they're building could revolutionize how we fly - cutting journey times in half while making supersonic travel accessible to more people than ever before.
