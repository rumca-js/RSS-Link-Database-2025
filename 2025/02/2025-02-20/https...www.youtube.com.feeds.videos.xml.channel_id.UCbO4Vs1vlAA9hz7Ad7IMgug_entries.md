WELCOME TO SPEARHEADZ! This casual gaming series is going to explore Warhammer's new format of fixed-list casual gaming. This wide-onramp new system for playing Games Workshop's cosmic-fantasy wargame is perfect for the kitchen-table game crowd and is perfectly suited for where I'm at with gaming. 

Mike is back with the new IRONJAWZ to take on my Slaves to Darkness in Spearhead.  More SPEARTIPZ today as well!
