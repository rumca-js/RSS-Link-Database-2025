After his Disney Plus series The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, Sam Wilson is back with his very first standalone movie as Captain America - Captain America: Brave New World! It finally gives the new Cap a chance to shine as he watches Thaddeus Ross kind of be the main character.

Captain America: Brave New World definitely raises some questions. Like why is this movie basically a sequel to The Incredible Hulk? Why isn’t The Hulk here? Why doesn’t Bucky help out at all? Why didn’t they have Betty Ross show up and give an emotional impact when it was actually needed?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for Captain America: Brave New World!
