<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m cleaning up from a time when I had a serious Kickstarter problem but also had a in-office job with a game night that provided an outlet for all these games. I don’t have the suburban pad that can store infinite games but I don’t want to drop them at goodwill and watch them tipped on their side and broken apart. Is there a good place in LA (west LA preferably anyone could think of that would enjoy a dozen or so nerdy but not insanely nerdy board games? I was thinking boys and girls clubs or something but I’ve got no idea where to start.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All. I have a question for the community about modern board games. For most of my life, I&#39;ve played &quot;classic&quot; games like chess, go, bridge, etc. A friend introduced me to more modern games recently and I&#39;ve really enjoyed them. I&#39;m feeling that something is missing for me, though. In general, it feels like there&#39;s not much room to improve as a player. That is, once you&#39;ve played a handful of games, you&#39;re about as good as you&#39;re ever going to get. That&#39;s not to say that the game won&#39;t continue to be fun, but I&#39;m realizing that the ability to grow is an important draw for me. </p> <p>(As an aside, I feel like some games increase the complexity of the rules or the equipment in order to draw out this growth period, but I don&#39;t think that is what I&#39;m looking for.)</p> <p>To be clear, I&#39;ve really enjoying the newer games, so Id really appreciate if anyone has suggestions for modern games whe

Do you have a favorite childhood game that you think still holds up in today&#39;s modern board game scene? Is there a game you love so much that it will never leave your shelf, even if you&#39;d never bring it to a Meetup with strangers?</p> <p>Now&#39;s your chance to embrace your inner Zee Garcia and talk up those niche titles that didn&#39;t get as much love as you thought they should.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1itrmp7/forgotten_favorites_hidden_gems_february_20_2025

## Did we accidentally ruin Box One? (Possible spoilers)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wife and I got this game delivered earlier tonight and were really excited to get started. We really didn’t do much research on it after seeing some positive comments online - just felt like it would be up our alley.</p> <p>Literally read the first instruction to find the black envelope in the box and look for the message inside. Withdraw the card but clearly feel that something is hidden inside. After re-reading the instructions we feel like it’s signaling us to open up the envelope and look inside. </p> <p>Did we ruin the game for ourselves and is there any point in playing through? Really hoping it’s a misdirect or something because that would be pretty terrible design otherwise. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Belaphor"> /u/Belaphor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1itrfos/did_we_accidentally_ruin_box_one_possible_spoilers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span

## What are some games other than Villainous that have players competing independently of one another?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I collect boardgame mechanics, and I was recently thinking about Villainous&#39;s independence. I can&#39;t think of any other than Villainous that utilize completely independent components. In the case of Villainous, each player is on their own board(realm), working towards their own goal with their own deck and even provide their own anti-deck(Fate) for the other players. The only component shared between them are the action points(power). Unmatched is the only thing I can think of that even comes close, but the goals and playing field are not independent. What are your thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alone_Advantage_9195"> /u/Alone_Advantage_9195 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1itq7x6/what_are_some_games_other_than_villainous_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1itq7x6/what_are_some_games_o

## Star Wars: Imperial Assault using the app

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Star Wars: Imperial Assault was recently recommended to me, and I have some questions. My partner and I finished all the Gloomhaven games, as well as Descent, and really like the tactical, turn-based &#39;dungeon crawler&#39; feel. We&#39;re working on Pericle at the moment (tough sledding, but we&#39;re getting there). We enjoy the DnD &#39;feel&#39; of games, but don&#39;t want to deal with a GM.</p> <p>What I can&#39;t figure out is how the app works with SW:IA. I&#39;ve watched a couple of Youtube videos to get a feel for the game, but no one seems to be using the app. My partner and I really like app-based games, so this would be a huge benefit (and we only want a fully co-op experience). Is there an option to play without the app, or with the app? </p> <p>Also, it seems this game was published over 10 years ago, so perhaps the app was added later in some expansions? I realize I am very late to the game on this, so please help me catch up.</p> <
