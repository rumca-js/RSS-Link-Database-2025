<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I watch YouTube on my Roku TV, and I mostly watch videos from my subscription tab. I usually scroll down to the last video I watched, then continue watching in chronological order. This afternoon when I went to that tab the shorts were all showing up on the top (I don&#39;t watch shorts so don&#39;t care) and it would only show videos that were uploaded in the last 24 hours. When I&#39;ve been working for several days I often fall a few days behind on uploads, so now I&#39;ll have to either go to individual channels to see if they&#39;ve uploaded anything, or just cast every single video from my phone. Super annoying either way!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AmeriKadzuku"> /u/AmeriKadzuku </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1itmqa0/did_the_roku_app_get_a_terrible_update/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1itmqa0/di
