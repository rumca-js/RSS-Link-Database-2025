## Bleakest, most emotionally devastating film you've ever seen? As for me, I have to go with Dennis Hopper's 1980 film "Out Of The Blue".

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those that haven&#39;t seen that movie, I can really only recommend it to people who are in a good enough place emotionally to handle it, because oh boy... that was a very tough watch. Fantastic movie though.</p> <p>Wondering what other movies come to mind for you that are in a similar vein. I think &quot;Funny Games&quot; somewhat approached that level of bleakness, but &quot;Out Of The Blue&quot; just felt so <em>real</em> in comparison that it really reached in and wrenched my heart in a way that a movie never has before.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy-Sequence999"> /u/Heavy-Sequence999 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iu9od5/bleakest_most_emotionally_devastating_film_youve/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iu9od5/bleakest_most_emotionally_devastating_film_youve/">[comments]</a></span>

Then there was the movie Chupa with Dr. Quinn trying to capture Chupa so he could use his blood to revolutionized medicine.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love the Mallrats movie, aswell as all the spin offs (clerks, jay and silent bob…etc) </p> <p>I’m looking for more movies with fun music, funny awkward characters etc. for reference I also love SLC Punk, UHF (weird Al) and movies like dumb and dumber, Wayne’s world, bill and Ted </p> <p>I’m craving a really good movie in this region. Just don’t know where to look. </p> <p>Edit: sorry to those I offended with my wrong listing of clerks being a spin off.
