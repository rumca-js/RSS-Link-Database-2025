Screaming Frog is cheap and extremely powerful, but not the easiest to learn. Even though there are so many awesome features - in my experience the interface overwhelms a lot of people. </p> <p>As a result, here are some of my favorite ways to use Screaming Frog for SEO:</p> <p><strong>1. Basic Crawls On Spider Mode</strong></p> <p>This is probably the most common use of Screaming Frog. Go to Mode &gt; Spider to ensure that your crawler is on &quot;Spider&quot; mode.

Have a website, have used some freelance SEO people to help build basics but am considering making a bigger commitment to focus more on it. </p> <p>It is a 7x more investment monthly compared to doing it myself and with freelancers. </p> <p>I&#39;m struggling to make that commitment without knowing the return. I know SEO isn&#39;t fast but what is the timeline I can expect to move from page 2-4 to top of page 1 (locally)?</p> <p>And what have others seen for lead volume in that position. Traffic is great but leads are what drive business. If I can&#39;t get organic spend to be at least on par with lead generating spend from a cost per lead perspective, how can I justify that spend?</p> <p>Open to be educated and thanks for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maybethisiswrong\"> /u/maybethisiswrong </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/",
