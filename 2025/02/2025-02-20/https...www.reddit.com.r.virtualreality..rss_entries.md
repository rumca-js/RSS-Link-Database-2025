<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the past year I have used a mismatch of triple 27-inch monitors limited to 60hz, but I genuinely enjoy being able to see around me on the track in VR. I got to try the PSVR2 with GT7 and was actually impressed how long I went without feeling sick. The image quality is much better than the quest 2 my brother lent me; it got me wondering if it&#39;s worth buying the PSVR2 or the Prima. The quest 2 was blurry at the edges despite my adjustments, the PSVR was amazing out the box even on pc. Truth is those are the only two headsets I&#39;ve tried, living in the middle of nowhere means my trips to microcenter are almost annual holiday for me. I was planning on going over to buy a CPU and a matching third monitor, but after trying out Sony&#39;s VR I&#39;m having second thoughts. </p> <p>TLDR: </p> <p>Would a Prima, PSVR2, or any decent headset today be worth it? I don&#39;t need hand controls as of yet, so that&#39;s not a deal breaker. Neither is new

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to buy my first VR headset, i&#39;ve never used it outside of Beatsaber/Superhot with some events in my area letting people try VR and i think it were some old technology, maybe the first VR to came out, because the quality wasn&#39;t the best.</p> <p>I don&#39;t want to rely purely on the VR headset power, i have a gaming pc with a Ryzen 5 5500 and a RTX 3060 with 12GB VRAM, not the best but enough for every game i play (i know the Ti with 8GB is better for gaming but i also use this GPU for rendering where VRAM quantity is important). I also want to use the AR capability of the headset, i saw a video of a guy shooting aliens raiding his home, neat.</p> <p>I work in game-development and my company has offered me an education to hop on VR projects next year, so i would need a headset to test prototypes.</p> <p>My budget is flexible, but in my area a used Quest 2 is ~150€, a Quest 3s ~350€ and the Quest 3 500€.</p> <p>If there is a better optio
