Visiting her grave brings me comfort, but I’ve always wished for a way to keep her memory alive beyond just a headstone.</p> <p>Since I live far away, I don’t always have the opportunity to visit her resting place. This made me wonder—what if there was a way to honor her memory no matter where I am? I searched for an app or platform that would allow me to preserve her stories, photos, and voice in a meaningful way, but I couldn’t find one that truly captured what I was looking for.</p> <p>That’s why I started working on a digital memorial project—a way for families to create a lasting tribute to their loved ones. Using a simple QR code, memories can be accessed anytime, anywhere, bringing people closer to those they’ve lost.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts. Would a digital memorial like this be meaningful for you? What features do you think would make it more personal and special?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I came across an article recently that really got me thinking. Junior devs today are shipping code faster than ever with AI tools. But when you ask them why their code works or about edge cases, many can’t explain.</p> <p>It feels like the foundational knowledge we used to gain by struggling through problems is missing.</p> <p>That’s why I am building <a href="https://coacho.ai">CoachoAI</a>. It is a personal AI Tutor to help developers build understanding of their target roles and skills based on their current experience. With <strong>personalized learning</strong>, <strong>structured checkpoints</strong>, <strong>assessments</strong>, and <strong>real-world projects</strong>, I aim to help devs not just write code, but truly get it.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, criticism or any suggestions on the app. Feel free to check it out here - <a href="https://coacho.ai">https://coacho.ai</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->
