I had ChatGPT interview me, ask questions, synthesize answers, then ask follow-up questions, all to create a virtual &quot;twin&quot; of myself that I could ask questions of to get a &quot;second opinion&quot; from a virtual twin of myself, in my voice and with my writing style and preferences. For months after, this worked fine. It ignored almost all of my formatting preferences for output, but every once in awhile, it would give me a response that felt out of character and I would ask it to confirm whether it was still using my virtual agent and i

Even with prompt tweaking, LLMs still tend to sound pretty generic.</p> <p>Does anything like this already exist? I assume the right tool would collect a large sample of my own writing—emails, documents, notes, etc.—and use that to fine-tune AI so it naturally mimics my style.</p> <p>I found a resource to convert mbox email archives into JSON, which seems like a useful step, but I haven’t seen anything that actually lets you <strong>easily feed AI a TON of your own writing</strong> in a simple, intuitive way.</p> <p>If you’ve used a tool or agent that does this, what was it, and did it actually improve AI’s ability to match your style? And if something like this doesn’t exist, doesn’t this seem like an obvious gap?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lafadeaway"> /u/lafadeaway </a> <br/> <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sam Altman made a claim recently that by 2035 everyone will have access to superintelligence (“intellectual capacity equivalent to <em>everyone</em> in 2025”) to “direct however they can imagine.” However, I don’t think this is the default outcome. AI truly as smart as today’s entire world would be able to build nuclear weapons, etc. The AI would have to be aligned to a degree that we do not know how to perform or validate. Otherwise, a single person could destroy the world if they jailbroke the AI. I don’t think world governments will allow that kind of risk. I’m not saying utopia in general is impossible, I just think Sam’s version of it is overly optimistic. What do y’all think?</p> <p>I go into more detailed analysis in this video if you’re interested:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gebx_uBJd4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gebx_uBJd4</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Imagine this scenario. A device (like a Google home hub) in your home or a humanoid robot in a warehouse. You talk to it. It answers you. You give it a direction, it does said thing. Your Google home /Alexa/whatever, same thing. Easy with one on one scenarios. One thing I&#39;ve noticed even with my own smart devices is it absolutely cannot tell when you are talking to it and when you are not. It just listens to everything once it&#39;s initiated. Now, with AI advancement I imagine this will get better, but I am having a hard time processing how something like this would be handled. </p> <p>An easy way for an AI powered device (I&#39;ll just refer to all of these things from here on as AI) to tell you are talking to it is by looking at it directly. But the way humans interact is more complicated than that, especially in work environments. We yell at each other from across a distance, we don&#39;t necessarily refer to each other by name, yet we someho
