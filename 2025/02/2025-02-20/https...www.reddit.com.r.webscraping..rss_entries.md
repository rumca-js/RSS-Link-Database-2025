<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys! New here. </p> <p>I just learned about map scraping (I don’t have a background in computer science or anything like that). I needed to get company names, cities and countries from a website map for a project at work and it seemed way too tedious to click on every single point on the map to then copy and paste the name of the company and its city and country of location. So I thought there’s got to be an easier way!! and that’s how I ended up down the map scraping rabbit hole BUT I found it so fun!!! </p> <p>Do you guys have examples of easy website where I can practice? Some websites seem to be too complicated considering I just learned this like 2 hours ago, but I just wanna try again. ALSO I don’t have any fancy software (like I said, I’m not a smart tech person) i only have excel at my disposal, if you guys know free software, im down for that but i cant start paying for software for something i found out about 2h ago. </p> <p>Feel free t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been experimenting with ChatGPT and other AI tools, trying to figure out how to pull new listing data from FB marketplace, NextDoor and Craigslist so I can get notified when a deal matching my criteria is posted in my area. The goal is to have it scan listings every couple minutes and then alert me when something is priced in my range.</p> <p>I have a call with a programmer next week to go over possible approaches. From what I’ve seen, marketplace data is publicly accessible without needing to be logged in, so I don’t think there’s a risk of getting banned that way. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s API for this since FB removed it years ago, and at the moment think that web scraping in my area is the best solution. Any thoughts or ideas to make it work are appreciated—thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bean-C0unter"> /u/Bean-C0unter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscr
