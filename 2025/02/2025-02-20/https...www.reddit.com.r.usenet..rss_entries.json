I downloaded NewsLazer (their recommended software), and was able to find 1 season of a docuseries that I love when searching for the series within NewsLazer. I was only able to find that 1 season when searching within NewsLazer. I don&#39;t know why they only have the most recent season since its a very old series.</p> <p>I signed up for NZBGeek and see all of the seasons I want, but I have no way to search for them within NewsLazer. Do I need another client to work specifically with NZBGeek? I know that I can download the actual NZB file from NZBGeek and import it into NewsLazer, but is there any way to search the Geek database with within NewsLazer?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RamblingDayAfterDay\"> /u/RamblingDayAfterDay </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iu21xh/using_newslazer_to_search_nzbgeek",
