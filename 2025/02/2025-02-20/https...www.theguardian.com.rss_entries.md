<p>The Albert Square soap’s 40th anniversary has been absolutely wild, and now it’s released its best live episode ever – even if the viewer vote on the outcome of a romantic plot wasn’t that thrilling</p><p>The 40th anniversary of EastEnders couldn’t have come at a better time. Ratings are in freefall; once the most watched thing on TV, these days the soap is lucky if it cracks the top 20. But an anniversary like this gives EastEnders an opportunity to not only celebrate itself, but to reaffirm its own mission statement. And it has gone about this by going on an absolute tear.</p><p>With little else to lose, EastEnders has spent the last few weeks wildly swinging for the fences.

<p>Donald Trump has increased his attacks on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling the Ukrainian president ‘a dictator’ – but why have elections been postponed?</p><p>If Russia had not invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Volodymyr Zelenskyy would have faced a re-election campaign in spring 2024. But after Vladimir Putin sent his troops across the border, the country quickly entered a state of martial law. That meant that both presidential and parliamentary elections were postponed. Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on Zelenskyy, calling the Ukrainian president “a dictator” in light of postponed elections.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/20/ukraine-elections-start-of-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy">Continue reading...</a>

## Motionless in White review – gothically glam US metalcore will put a grin on your face

<p><strong>O2 Academy, Glasgow<br></strong>Backed by skeletons, cheerleaders and chainsaw-wielders, Chris Cerulli and co reject heavy metal menace in favour of a charming sense of fun</p><p>Motionless in White have the commendable quality of a stadium-headlining band playing a 2,000-capacity theatre. Formed almost 20 years ago in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the metalcore five-piece lay it on thick from the off, with dancing girls, pyrotechnics and a wall of Blade Runner visuals to match the colossal riffs of recent single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXOvKa2mAIQ">Meltdown</a>. Lead vocalist Chris “Motionless” Cerulli is darkly handsome in a sleek black coat, incongruously low-key compared to his corpse paint-wearing bandmates. But his goth smarts against the cartoonish metal surroundings are a neat analogue for the band’s sound: classic metalcore with a glam, gothic edge.</p><p>He may be relatively unshowy, but Cerulli’s impressively malleable voice carries the show’s emotion

<p>The revered but divisive American director, who died in 1984, would have turned 100 this week. We rate his greatest movies, from Straw Dogs to The Wild Bunch</p><p>After making his name as a director of westerns, Sam Peckinpah was given his first shot at making a major studio film – an epic about a tyrannical cavalry officer (Charlton Heston) leading an expedition into Mexico. The production set a template for later Peckinpah films – heavy drinking, personality clashes, battles with the suits, and a final cut not matching the director’s vision. Major Dundee was a victim of its chaotic ambition and it’s easy to see why it flopped on release: even in the 2005 restored version, it is hopelessly unfocused, taking in Dundee’s Moby-Dick-like mission to track down an Apache chief, the dynamics of the US civil war, encounters with the French army and an unconvincing romantic interlude. But it’s interestingly flawed, a sort of dry run for The Wild Bunch, and Richard Harris is entertaining

<p><strong>(Polydor)</strong><br>On his third album, produced by the War on Drugs, the North Shields singer-songwriter shows just how gifted he is at pairing stadium choruses with sharp, bleak vignettes</p><p>Sam Fender’s third album ends with a track called Remember My Name. It’s clearly a very personal song, about its author’s late grandfather – even revealing the address of his council house, 11 Walk Avenue. The northern British references – “Chasing a cross in from the wing / Our boy’s a whippet, he’s faster than anything” – are amplified both by Fender’s Geordie vowels and the backing, provided by the Easington Colliery brass band. It’s all very specific and individual – you really don’t hear brass bands, or indeed the mention of whippets in pop very often – and yet Remember My Name seems to have something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about it. You can immediately imagine its soaring melody being sung en masse by a huge festival audience, which is, one suspects, precisely the

But many shows have failed to deliver meaningful storylines about transgender characters. Shows such as The Jeffersons<em> </em>and The Parkers, for instance, have leaned on tired, transphobic tropes: the process of transitioning is typically reduced to a single operation that characters get off-screen; trans women are often outed by accident, the punchline in a joke about gender; or trans people are abandoned once a cisgender character who’s initially expressed romantic interest in them suddenly discovers their gender identity and bolts.</p><p>Across television programs, trans characters (usually played by cis actors) function as punchlines, villains or have no legitimate storyline to begin with.

At 75, it’s&nbsp;about one in seven, while those fortunate enough to reach 85 face a&nbsp;one in three chance.</p><p>Given the toll this illness takes on sufferers and those around them, hundreds of millions of families around the world are desperate for a medical breakthrough – and for years, headlines have suggested that it might be imminent.

Until it picked up best film at the Bafta awards, no one had really been taking this papal intrigue drama all that seriously – all the smart money was on one of two very American films: Anora and The Brutalist.

But could Conclave pull off a Green Book-style surge to the line, getting past more fashionable and/or artsy efforts through the virtues of sturdy, muscular storytelling?</p><p>For this is surely the basis of Conclave’s appeal to Oscar voters. Although blessed by brilliant, subtle performances (courtesy of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow among others), and handsomely mounted design and camerawork, Conclave’s great strength is its narrative furniture, a build-out of the microcosm that is the papal

<p>If the country holds out against the Trump-assisted AfD, it shows rightwing populism can be resisted in Europe’s heartland</p><p>Even in less stressed times, Britain always pays too much attention to the US and too little to Germany. In today’s torrid circumstances, that imbalance is perhaps excusable. After all, Donald Trump, it now turns out, really means it. He is more interested in US plunder and profit from places like Gaza, Ukraine and Greenland than in upholding a just peace or good order.</p><p>Even so, the inattention towards Germany needs to end. Britain’s politicians, like German politicians, are rewiring their worldviews amid a political gale. But Germany, though no longer a great power, is nevertheless a great nation. Indeed, it may be more than ever the essential European nation now, after the Trump administration’s very public trashing of the entire Atlantic alliance seemed to leave Europe to its own devices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20

The image is just one of many by the late Ernest Cole depicting the dehumanisation of Black people during apartheid. Writing for Ebony<em> </em>magazine in 1968, the South African photographer explained how he wanted his work to “show the world what the white South African had done to the Black”. Since the late 1950s, he had been chronicling, up close and in detail, the horrors of racial segregation for publications such as<em> </em>Drum and the New York Times and had become arguably the most significant photographer documenting the country’s oppressive regime.</p><p>“Ernest’s photos are the first ones that gave us an idea of what apartheid was, fro

<p>A Marxist critique of left-liberal politics that delivers its message with punch and panache</p><p>The British left used to be a force to&nbsp;reckon with. Edward Heath’s government was famously felled by the miners in 1974 – the only instance in postwar European history when working-class power resulted in the overthrow of a ruling party. These days, however, the concept of the working class has an almost retro feel. Trade union membership has plummeted. Expressions of collective solidarity have likewise vanished. Disaffection has far from disappeared, only now it manifests in the form of petty crime and race riots.</p><p>In Minority Rule, Ash Sarkar blames the rightwing press for this shift. Thanks to tabloid agents provocateurs and their political creatures in Westminster, she says, the lower orders have abandoned class war for the culture wars. Accordingly, more and more of them spend their weekends not on the barricades but behind computer screens, fuming over small boats and

Inevitably, the film also acts as yet another outpost of the “Football, bloody hell!” documentary industrial complex, with one more airing of the footage of United’s Champions League final triumph.</p><p>Admittedly, there’s now an extra dimension to Clive Tyldesley’s strangulated shrieks as United scored their winner: this was Schmeichel’s last game for the side, having unexpectedly announced his exit from the team earlier in the season.

<p>Imperial Property Group said it rented homes to NHS staff. In fact, they were torn apart to create drug factories, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage. Why has the culprit not been brought to justice?</p><p>When Hajaj Hajaj decided to rent out his house in south London in the summer of 2020, his daughter, Kinda Jackson, urged him to use a reputable lettings agent for peace of mind. Her father had enough on his plate. Hajaj, a 79-year-old retired garage owner, is the primary carer for his wife, who has Alzheimer’s disease. The income from the rental property in Lewisham is effectively Hajaj’s pension, which he uses to pay for her care.</p><p>So, when a manager from Imperial Property Group contacted Hajaj about his Gumtree listing, Hajaj arranged to meet them.

For almost a decade, I unlocked cells in residential blocks, healthcare units, first night centres, close supervision centres and segregation units. The twist and click of a key in the lock came to feel like background noise to me. But there are some occasions I remember more vividly than others. Sometimes the person inside wasn’t so keen on coming out.</p><p>One of those challenging incidents took place a few years ago, while I was on shift in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/17/mental-health-prison-segregation-units-prisoners">segregation unit</a> in a busy London jail.
