<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good evening everyone! I run a mail server at home behind DynDNS. It has around 30 mailboxes with 7 domains. These are mailboxes for family and friends. I currently run a VPS on which Proxmox Mailgateway runs. This is currently used as a spam filter and gateway. Unfortunately, too much spam is allowed through and I want to get away from the server. Does anyone know of a good cloud spam filter that can be used to send emails as an SMTP relay? And as inexpensively as possible. I would like to have both in one solution, but I am open to other solutions! I don&#39;t want to rent a mail server, but rather continue to operate it myself.

## Would mailcow work well as a simple SMTP server for automated app emails?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am well aware that self-hosting email is almost universally regarded as a bad idea on this sub, but I was wondering if it would be appropriate for this simple use case:</p> <p>I&#39;m setting up some apps (such as Mealie) that I would like to make available to friends and family, and there&#39;s an option to include an SMTP server for automated app emails such as password reset for users. It&#39;s not strictly necessary to set this up, so I&#39;m not really interested in going to great lengths or expense to configure this, but if I can just set up a mailcow container and let it rip, it would be cool to enable this option for my other apps. </p> <p>I know the main obstacle is making sure emails actually get past spam filters and land in user inboxes, and that would obviously still apply here, so if there&#39;s any tips you have to getting this to work, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m extremely interested in getting into self hosting and my motivation is mainly learning which hopefully will skew into life long journey of self hosting, currently I want to start off with hosting Immich and then wire guard which I’ll use to connect to raspberry pi with hard connected at home that I’ll use for backup. What I would ideally want is to learn/use Kubernetes as part of my server deployment/management and then automation tool like ansible. Can you guys point me in right direction of resources I can study that will help me accomplish this? And if I am thinking of wrong tools correct me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VoldemortWasaGenius"> /u/VoldemortWasaGenius </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1itl0jf/guidance_needed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1itl0jf/guidance_needed/">[comments]</a></sp
