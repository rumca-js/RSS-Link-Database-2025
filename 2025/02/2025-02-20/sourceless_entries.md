From a tiny electric jolt when touching a doorknob to styrofoam peanuts that cling to a mischievous cat's fur -- the well-known and seemingly simple phenomenon of static electricity has puzzled people since antiquity. How could this ubiquitous effect, frequently demonstrated to bedazzled children by rubbing a balloon on their hair, still not be completely understood by scientists? For centuries, static electricity has been the subject of intrigue and scientific investigation. Now, researchers have uncovered a vital clue to this enduring mystery: the contact history of materials controls how they exchange charge. The groundbreaking findings explain the prevailing unpredictability of contact electrification, unveiling order from what has long been considered chaos.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a diverse group of synthetic chemicals, are commonly used in numerous products such as semiconductors, fire-extinguishing foams, heat-resistant, and non-stick cookware. PFAS possess remarkable resistance to heat, oil, grease, and water that can be attributed to the strong chemical bonds between the atoms. However, the major drawback of the exceptional resistance is that PFAS are highly persistent in the environment, earning the nickname "forever chemicals."

For many corporate teams, the notion of "good conflict" is merely a myth. Most often, conflict is seen as a roadblock to success–especially when it involves clashing personalities or disagreements over strategy. But what if—in certain cases—the right kind of team conflict fuels creativity? That's the idea behind our new research, which suggests that if handled well, some team fights might just be the key to sparking fresh ideas.

It has puzzled scientists for years whether and how bacteria, that live from dissolved organic matter in marine waters, can carry out N2 fixation. It was assumed that the high levels of oxygen combined with the low amount of dissolved organic matter in the marine water column would prevent the anaerobic and energy consuming N2 fixation.

## Ultrafast vortex electron diffraction: A new way to observe electrons in motion

Electrons oscillate around the nucleus of an atom on extremely short timescales, typically completing a cycle in just a few hundred attoseconds. Because of their ultrafast motions, directly observing electron behavior in molecules has been challenging. Now researchers from UC San Diego's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry have suggested a new method to make visualizing electron motion a reality.

Stars form in regions of space known as stellar nurseries, where high concentrations of gas and dust coalesce to form a baby star. Also called molecular clouds, these regions of space can be massive, spanning hundreds of light-years and forming thousands of stars. And while we know much about the life cycle of a star thanks to advances in technology and observational tools, precise details remain obscure. For example, did stars form this way in the early universe?

In molecular shuttles, a ring molecule is threaded onto a linear molecular strand and can move between two portions of the strand, called stations, in response to external stimuli. Chemical stimuli, light or mechanical forces determine the time the shuttle spends at each station while it hops back and forth by random thermal motion. Measuring individual trajectories during the operation of such synthetic devices is crucial for a thorough understanding of their operation and in the optimization of molecular machines.

Indigenous people make up only 6% of the world's population but manage over a quarter of the world's land surface. These groups, descended from original occupants of a geographical place and identifying as culturally distinct, possess knowledge about adapting to social and environmental change. Yet their perspectives are rarely included when it comes to planning for a future affected by climate change or biodiversity loss. Researcher Julia van Velden was part of a team of scholars who looked at how Indigenous knowledge could create a shared understanding of a better future for our planet. The Conversation Africa spoke to her and her co-authors about Indigenous futures thinking.
