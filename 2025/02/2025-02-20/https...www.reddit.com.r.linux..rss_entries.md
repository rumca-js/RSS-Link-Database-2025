<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I have a dual-boot setup with Windows and Linux, and I&#39;m using Nvidia drivers on both. I&#39;ve noticed a weird issue recently: whenever I launch a game on Windows, my laptop fan stays almost silent, and my game performance drops significantly. Before, the fan would kick in when playing games on Windows because the GPU would be in use, but now it&#39;s almost completely quiet, and the game runs very poorly.</p> <p>For context, I have the <code>nvidia-open</code> drivers installed on my Linux installation. Could this be causing any issues when I boot back into Windows? I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on, and I haven&#39;t changed anything else in my setup recently.</p> <p>Any advice or thoughts on what might be causing this would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GuiFlam123"> /u/GuiFlam123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1

The problem is as follows:</p> <p>Every 4-5 months i get a windows update which require a restart, windows then restarts a couple or so times and tells me that its &quot;repairing the disk&quot; (that being said, i dont think this quote was shown to me last week, but i vaguely remember it appearing a couple of months ago before this problem occurred again). Afterwards, it restarts into windows directly. No issues till now. I open up my work in windows and finish, then shutdown my PC/Laptop. The next morning comes and i boot up my laptop, and im expecting linux to open since i have it as my first option in my boot sequence, it doesnt open and im booted straight into windows. I restart and enter my bios to double check the boot sequence, yep linux is the first one, so i assum

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called &quot;Linux&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. L
