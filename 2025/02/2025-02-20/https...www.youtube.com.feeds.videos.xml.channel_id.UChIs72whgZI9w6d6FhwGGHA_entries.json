        "description": "Sponsor: Thermal Grizzly Duronaut on Amazon - https://geni.us/tpgcPMw\nNVIDIA's DLSS 4 and MFG (Multi-Frame Generation) are a big part of the company's marketing as it tries to make its RTX 50 series, especially the inbound RTX 5070, look better. Multi-Frame Generation now comes in a \"4X\" variant, which we'll look at today. This image quality comparison evaluates Native vs. DLSS with the Transformer and CNN models, fake frame image quality, and looks at ghosting, artifacts, blurring, and distortion in the various tested games. This follows the launch of the NVIDIA RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti GeForce cards. The next cards are the NVIDIA RTX 5070 and AMD RX 9070 XT and 9070.\n\nWatch our performance comparison of the DLSS Transformer vs CNN models (and learn important basics): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1FHR9fkJk\nNVIDIA also has fake price technology. You can learn about that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s4hxa2TjWY\nAnd even fake inventory: https://www.youtube.com/",
