AI truly as smart as today\u2019s entire world would be able to build nuclear weapons, etc. The AI would have to be aligned to a degree that we do not know how to perform or validate. Otherwise, a single person could destroy the world if they jailbroke the AI. I don\u2019t think world governments will allow that kind of risk. I\u2019m not saying utopia in general is impossible, I just think Sam\u2019s version of it is overly optimistic. What do y\u2019all think?</p> <p>I go into more detailed analysis in this video if you\u2019re interested:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gebx_uBJd4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gebx_uBJd4</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/c",

You give it a direction, it does said thing. Your Google home /Alexa/whatever, same thing. Easy with one on one scenarios. One thing I&#39;ve noticed even with my own smart devices is it absolutely cannot tell when you are talking to it and when you are not. It just listens to everything once it&#39;s initiated. Now, with AI advancement I imagine this will get better, but I am having a hard time processing how something like this would be handled. </p> <p>An easy way for an AI powered device (I&#39;ll just refer to all of these things from here on as AI) to tell you are talking to it is by looking at it directly. But the way humans interact is more complicated than that, especially in work environments.
