<p>External USB/Thunderbolt drives (aka direct-attached storage, or DAS) are a super-convenient way to quickly back up your important files, as well as store any data that you don’t need on your computer’s fast internal storage. They’re also extremely handy for transporting data between locations and devices.</p>
