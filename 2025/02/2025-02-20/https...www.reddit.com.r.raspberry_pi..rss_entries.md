<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve gotten a raspberry pi 5, and have been booting Batocera off of the sd card slot as a sort of retro pi project. However, between very intermittent drive failure, lack of storage, and lack of read/write speeds, I&#39;ve been looking to upgrade to a 1 tb 2230 SSD. However, I&#39;ve heard that the NVMe slot on the pi 5 is not an m.2 slot, and I would need to pi an &quot;m.2 hat&quot;. Is this true? And in addition, this is the Cana kit bundle, so would the m.2 hat interfere with the case/cooling pad. The cooling pad/heatsink is already applied, so would I need to take it off? If so, how would I go about doing that? All help is appreciated </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/North_Mud512"> /u/North_Mud512 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1itz0l6/rpi5_ssd_choices_and_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_p

## Raspberry Pi5 Nas + Plex+ cloud?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys i&#39;m new to the Pi ecosystem, i&#39;ve managed so far to create a raid5 Nas with my Pi5, the radxa hat and OMV. Now i think i can safly add plex (other option?) on it to access its content on smart TV etc right? But My next question would be, is it possible somehow to make all that accessible outside my private network? (how?) for exemple when i&#39;m on hollidays or whatever? or accessory create my own &quot;dropbox&quot; (maybe a different partion than the plex one)? if so do you guys have any cool easy tuto? cheers! ( ps: i did research, i know all is kinda possible separatly, but is it all at once?? won&#39;t one thing mess with another? ) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rom_Z"> /u/Rom_Z </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1itpcvq/raspberry_pi5_nas_plex_cloud/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/commen

## Issues Running Pi5 Code on Pi4

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heya, I’m running a project where I recently had to switch out my pi5 for a pi4. The code has pretty much ran all the same way except the I2C bus. I’m interfacing a common MCP 4728 DAC via I2C but for some reason it’s not working. The DAC address is at 0x60 and I have confirmed it is being picked up by the pi4 through the terminal on I2C1(using the smbus library) but the code is not working despite same wiring. I also checked already that the gpio pins are infact configured to sda and scl.</p> <p>Is there any difference between pi4 and pi5 in the I2C interface I might be missing? The code worked seamlessly on the pi 5.</p> <p>Any insight would be great thanks!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious_Dream3016"> /u/Suspicious_Dream3016 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ito5kh/issues_running_pi5_code_on_pi4/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
