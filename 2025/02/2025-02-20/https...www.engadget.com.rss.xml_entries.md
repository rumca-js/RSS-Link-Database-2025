<p>Samwise Gamgee said, "It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish." But then, he hadn't been exposed to the world of video game development. <em>Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</em>, a cozy take on the most idyllic pocket of Middle Earth, has been delayed. The new launch date is July 29. According to a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165" data-original-link="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165"><ins>post</ins></a> from the devs at WƒìtƒÅ Workshop Game Studio, this delay is about ensuring that all the project's supported platforms "can enjoy the same cozy experience." It is currently slated to launch on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Steam and Xbox Series X.</p>

I hesitate to even call it "cheap." As a successor to the $429 iPhone SE, it's hard not to see the 16e as a disappointment. Sure, it's $200 less than the vanilla iPhone 16 (which I argued was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/its-a-good-year-to-buy-the-vanilla-iphone-16-and-avoid-the-se-at-all-costs-192919611.html">a great deal at launch</a>), and the 16e also packs in the latest A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence.

<p><em>Among Us VR</em> has proven itself to be a major hit since <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/among-us-vr-release-date-174944724.html">first being released back in 2022</a>.

<p>This title keeps the core gameplay loop from the original, but shifts to a first-person perspective. It&#39;s basically a new way to keep sabotaging your friends and family. <em>Among Us 3D</em> is for four to ten players and includes native proximity voice chat, with no need for a third-party platform. All of the minigames are returning, though there‚Äôs also

<p>The Action button is available on nearly every iPhone Apple sells, offering a quick way to access a feature, app or shortcut on your phone, just by pushing a button. It can be a flashlight, activate a smart home routine or let you access any number of custom shortcuts without having to unlock your phone and pick through apps.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been ten long years since <em>Avatar: The Legend of Korra</em> aired its final episode and over 15 years since <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> bowed out.

<p>Franchise creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are developing the series, so we know it&#39;s in good hands. The plot sounds pretty dark. It seems the world has fallen into chaos following a cataclysmic event of some kind.

<p>Time (and perhaps a large check or two) heals all wounds. Amazon and the longtime producers and custodians of the James Bond movies have finally agreed on a way forward for the series. Amazon MGM Studios will form a joint venture with Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli that will hold the intellectual property rights and ensure they remain co-owners of the franchise. However, Wilson and Broccoli will be stepping back to focus on other projects, with Amazon gaining full creative control.</p>

<p>On the Friday after Christmas, OpenAI <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">published a blog post</a> titled "Why OpenAI's structure must evolve to advance our mission." In it, the company detailed a plan to reorganize its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC). In the weeks since that announcement, I've spoken to some of the country's leading corporate law experts to gain a better understanding of OpenAI's plan, and, more importantly, what it might mean for its mission to build safe artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>

The streaming service has announced that starting on April 19, all uploads and highlights will count towards a new 100-hour storage limit for each streamer, whether the videos are published or not. To note, the cap doesn&#39;t apply to past broadcasts, which are previous livestreams saved to a streamer&#39;s account for on-demand viewing, or clips, which are minute-long segments that can be shared to social networks. Highlights can be longer than clips and can be made of several key moments from a video, which means they could take up more storage space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there‚Äôs one downside to the sheer number of security cameras Ring makes, it‚Äôs the <em>sheer darn volume of them</em>. Joining the mob today is the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cameras/ring-brings-2k-video-resolution-to-its-cameras-151625629.html">Outdoor Cam Plus</a>, packing a new high-quality lens and 2K imaging sensor promising ‚Äúa clear, colorful view even in near dark conditions.‚Äù It‚Äôs clad in a weather-resistant body and can run from mains power, via a rechargeable battery or with one of Ring‚Äôs custom solar panels. The company adds the Plus is just as comfortable working indoors as out in the open, and ships with a new mount that will even hold the camera in place on ceilings.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately you might have to spend some time poring through the specs to work out where this one will sit in Ring‚Äôs camera firmament. After all, there‚Äôs already the Stick Up Cam, Stick Up Cam Pro and Stick Up Cam Elite available to buy in the US, and that's be

But that won‚Äôt be out until much later this year, so in the meantime, it‚Äôs come out with the Legion Go S, a slightly sturdier and more portable way to frag while you‚Äôre out and about. Now the tricky thing about this device is that it will be available in a bunch of different configurations including one that comes pre-installed with SteamOS ‚Äî a first for any portable PC not made by Valve. Frankly, that‚Äôs the version we‚Äôre most interested in. However, the one running Windows 11 is out now, so it‚Äôs a good time to get familiar with it and see if it‚Äôs worth the money or if you should just wait for t

<p>After much anticipation, Apple finally <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-announces-the-iphone-16e-with-apple-intelligence-for-599-161435140.html">announced the iPhone 16e</a> yesterday. Looking at its position in the company&#39;s lineup, the 16e is a headscratcher. My colleague Ian Carlos Campbell already wrote about how strange it is that the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-16es-lack-of-magsafe-doesnt-make-sense-202101406.html">phone is missing MagSafe</a>, a feature universally loved by Apple users. However, the omission that stands out the most to me is that the iPhone 16e doesn&#39;t come with more than a single rear camera, and no, 2x telephoto cropping doesn&#39;t count.</p>

## The Oppo Find N5 is an impressive, very thin foldable with a giant battery

<p>Oppo is back with a new foldable, and the Find N5 is a technically impressive balance of thinness and power. Skipping over the whole unlucky number four thing (this is technically the fourth iteration of the Find foldable), the company claims its latest book-style foldable is the world‚Äôs thinnest at 8.92mm. That&#39;s not a lot thicker than a typical flagship phone. Despite that, the Find N5 has a 6.62-inch outer display and an 8.12-inch inner screen which, Oppo says, features multiple durability improvements, flanked by a new titanium hinge.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity: While you may not have bought, used or even seen an Oppo phone, this company is under the same corporate owner as OnePlus.
