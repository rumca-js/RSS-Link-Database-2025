<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I’m a university student and one of my assignments is that i need to find viruses on a vm. I am using process explorer and i want to find a path of a malware using process explorer but it doesn’t show. I researched a bit and it said there are a couple of reasons why this might happen and one of the reasons was that because the malware hides it, and since this is malware i’m almost certain that that’s the reason it doesn’t show. Is there any way that i could view the path because i need to put in a disassembler to see what exactly it does.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Loatious"> /u/Loatious </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/6m0wvyvkd4le1.jpeg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ix76ii/how_to_find_a_path_of_a_process_when_it_doesnt/">[comments]</a></span>
