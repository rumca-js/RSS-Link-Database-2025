        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wonder what would be the best way to share media files with a friend without exposing my whole internal network, which I guess would be the case if I just hand them a VPN user? I guess I could also open a port on the router for my openmediavault server, but somehow I find that scary. A mix of both would be great, a VPN user that can only access a certain IP/port. But for that I guess I would need something like wireguard? Would that be a (recommendable) option to run a wireguard (lxc on the same proxmox server my openmediavault is on), open a port for it on the fritzbox and hope not to get hacked? Thanks for any advice on getting me started on this.

I then have a Qnap NAS. For the applications that need bulk storage, would you prefer adding the storage from QNAP to Proxmox, then adding a new large drive to the VM and write the data to that, or do i mount the shares inside the VM and write my immich or jellyfin data to the NAS directly?</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure wether one or the other has a clear benefit. I just feel like it could be nice to not just have a 2TB qcow image on the NAS but to be able to read at least some of the Data directly.

Last year, I upgraded the drives in the DS1819+ and wanted to repurpose the old drives from my DS1819+ in my DS1513+ backup server.

I am trying to host a minecraft server for my kids and their friends. The problem is i have starlink (CGNAT) </p> <p>I have: Truenas scale electric eel, a web domain, A cloudflare account.</p> <p>HP Pavilion Ryzen 3600g, 32gigs ram, 200mbps/s down, 25mbps/s up, 50ms lag. </p> <p>Cloudflare tunneling didn&#39;t work as it was very slow. Tailscale doesn&#39;t work as i need random kids to be able to get access hence the web domain hosted on cloudflare. Is wireguard the answer? I&#39;m like 80 hours into this and burned out. And if i can solve this problem, i can solve other problems i have that are similar.<br/> I&#39;m a truck driver, not a programmer so talk to me like im in first grade.
