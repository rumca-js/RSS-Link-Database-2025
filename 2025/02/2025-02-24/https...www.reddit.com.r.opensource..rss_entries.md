<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using Yuzu Browser on android for more than 5 years. I love how it caches pages so navigating back isinstant, since they are still loaded in background. Also love how I can have hundreds of tabs and quickly switch between them or close them with single tap.</p> <p>Unfortunately it&#39;s been 4 years since last update, it&#39;s basically dead. I would love something more modern, that handles passkeys and other stuff.</p> <p>Adblock should be mandatory. DNS block is not, I am already using Adguard Home.</p> <p>Any recommendations? Needs to be fast, does not need to have nice UI, just need to be functional and be able to use passkeys. Big plus for fast-back. It&#39;s really mandatory for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FluffyDiscord"> /u/FluffyDiscord </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ixdnr9/android_browser_with_fastback/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Inspired by so many successful OSS, I refactored the codebase into <a href="https://github.com/Ali-Hussein-dev/DeepReact">new repo</a> to make it open-source. My project is a tiny search engine built with Nextjs 15 &amp; Supabase for React ecosystem that make quality first content easily accessible and discoverable.</p> <p>I&#39;m creating this project because I think generic search engines don&#39;t show us the best results—they just show what&#39;s most relevant, and that&#39;s not cutting it anymore in this age of endless content. Plus, I&#39;m adding a built-in directory to help users explore the ecosystem, something generic search engines can&#39;t pull off.</p> <p>If you think search engines don&#39;t show us quality results all the time, I would love to hear your thoughts whether it is real problem that need to be solved or not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PerspectiveGrand716"> /u/Pers

## Should Open Source Have Ethical Boundaries? (Ethical Open License)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about open source and the weird contradiction at its core. On one hand, it&#39;s all about collaboration, freedom, and making things better for everyone. On the other hand, once you release your code, you have <strong>zero</strong> say in how it&#39;s used.</p> <p>If someone takes your open-source project and uses it for mass surveillance, autonomous weapons, or worse – well, tough luck. That&#39;s just how it works. But does it <strong>have</strong> to be that way?</p> <p>That&#39;s why I started working on the <strong>Ethical Open License (EOL)</strong>. It’s a license that keeps the core ideas of open-source intact <strong>but adds ethical boundaries</strong>. The basic rule: use, modify, and distribute the software all you want – <strong>as long as you’re not using it for unethical purposes</strong> (think AI-driven discrimination, exploitation networks, etc.).</p> <p>Now, I know this raises a lot of questions:</p> <u
