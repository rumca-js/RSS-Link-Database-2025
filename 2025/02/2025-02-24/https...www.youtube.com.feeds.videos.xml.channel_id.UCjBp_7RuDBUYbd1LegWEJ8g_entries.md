A day passing as slowly as a village brook? That‚Äôs not in Will‚Äôs dictionary. Sure, you might get a moment to polish the goods on display or tweak your shop‚Äôs decor‚Äîbut once those doors swing open and customers start pouring in, it‚Äôs all about charm, shopkeeper‚Äôs strategy, and the fine art of the haggle. But when the last deal is struck and the business day ends, there‚Äôs no time for a well-earned nap. That‚Äôs when adventure begins!

With Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, a new array of challenges unfolds. New mechanics, an expanded arsenal of weapons and gear, uncharted biomes teeming with treasures and enemies to vanquish in combat, and a fresh story to uncover‚ÄîWill and his companions find themselves stranded in the mysterious village of Tresna, trapped in a dimension far from home. To get back, they‚Äôll need to master both trade and blade. Coming to Xbox in 2025!
