## Nintendo's Radar Scope arcade game is under appreciated in my opinion

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Radarscope is most well known as the game that failed and had to be replaced with Donkey Kong and while that game was an absolute classic, I think the pleasures of Radar Scope are a bit under appreciated.</p> <p>Yes, the game is essentially a version of Galaxians, but I think it does a few nice things with the formula such as getting more points the closer an enemy is to the bottom of the screen when you shoot them and having a health bar down the bottom that gets depleted from the shots and bombs that dont hit your gun turret. </p> <p>In some ways I think you can think of this health bar as a precurser to the bonus timer in Donkey Kong. The healthier you are at the end of a round, the more bonus points you get.</p> <p>Does anyone else appreciate Radar Scope?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/superegz"> /u/superegz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ixfs9p/nint

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello friends! This has been bugging me for a while, and I&#39;m hoping someone can help identify this.</p> <p>Windows 98 I believe. There was an old guided tour &quot;game,&quot; where you follow a man around the inside of a computer and he points out components and explains what they do. The game starts out with the camera circling a room/office, and then it flies into the computer through a vent. Even though the man walks around a set path and explains components, you&#39;re free to run around the computer and explore however you want. There are no puzzles or goals, the guy will just walk around and talk as if you&#39;re still following him.</p> <p>Any help figuring out this mystery??? :) thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chewbacca541"> /u/Chewbacca541 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ixcxv7/help_finding_cdrom_era_software/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, way back when, during the ancient times, this was one of the few NES games I beat as a child (5 years old). But, I haven&#39;t touched the game in 30 years. Now I wanted to see if I could still beat it after so many years. And yeah, it wasn&#39;t so bad. People say this game is hard? Sure, the button mashing is rough. Clearly this game was made with a turbo functioning controller in mind, but it&#39;s very possible to beat without one, your arm is just jelly after the play through. </p> <p>This was done on a regular NES system, using a retrotink to upscale, and using a normal NES controller. </p> <p>I will say, I think the AVGN video, while really funny, did hurt this game&#39;s reputation. Granted, it&#39;s not like people talked about this game at all before then, but I think this game is pretty fun to play. Of course, all the criticisms about the game are valid.
