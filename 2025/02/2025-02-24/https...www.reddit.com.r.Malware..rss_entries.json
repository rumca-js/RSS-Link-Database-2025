I am using process explorer and i want to find a path of a malware using process explorer but it doesn\u2019t show. I researched a bit and it said there are a couple of reasons why this might happen and one of the reasons was that because the malware hides it, and since this is malware i\u2019m almost certain that that\u2019s the reason it doesn\u2019t show. Is there any way that i could view the path because i need to put in a disassembler to see what exactly it does.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Loatious\"> /u/Loatious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/6m0wvyvkd4le1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ix76ii/how_to_find_a_path_of_a_process_when_it_doesnt/\">[comments]</a></span>",
