The stream was actually of a higher quality, and there were very few commercials (many times, not a single advert) on the streams I watched (one of them was &quot;Sky Sport 1&quot; from New Zealand I guess). </p> <p>Growing up, I always wondered what actually happened between overs, when the greedy broadcasters showed us ads.

VM&#39;s constantly lose connection, freeze or just hang up for tens of minutes or until restart. As far as I can tell, it&#39;s a problem specifically with OracleVM, but I&#39;m sort of just tired of testing various configs, so lately I&#39;ve been thinking about a dedicated PC for just torrenting, preferably one with Ubuntu. </p> <p>Specifically talking about somewhat low-power PC&#39;s, maybe small form factor, running off of Ubuntu on SSD&#39;s as main OS, and pumping downloads into external hard drives. Possibly with the ability to remote into the machine from main PC, maybe connecting to home group for easy data share. </p> <p>Has anyone setup dedicated torrenting machines and can share the experience or have some advice? </p
