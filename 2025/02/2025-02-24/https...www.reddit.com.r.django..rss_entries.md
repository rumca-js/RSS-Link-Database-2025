My last experience with AD is 12 years ago so I&#39;m a bit lost and banging my head against a wall. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been given an application ID (Entra ID?) and a tenant ID. I have attempted to use django-auth-ldap, but I think that is not focused on SAML. So I switched to django-saml2-auth. I see a place in that package to configure EntityID, but nothing about tenant ID. So now I&#39;m concerned that I might be going down the wrong road once more.</p> <p>I found this excellent video from BugBytes that helped me understand some of the concepts, but I didn&#39;t see anything about SAML (or I do not understand.) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02stKhdxi4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02stKhdxi4</a></p> <p>Do you have any advice for how I can use an application ID and tenant ID to configure my django app to authenticate against AD?

I mistakenly created 420k objects of 3 types so about 2,5 million rows (note to self never use django polymorphic again) + 2,5 million m2m rows. Dumb on my part, poor testing, I know. To fix it I prepared a qs.delete() and expected a rather quick result but instead it takes half an hour and I notice the app (container 1) and postgres (container 2) taking huge amounts of cpu and memory resources, taking turns at it. As I&#39;m writing this post it is still going strong at 10GB of memory. I&#39;ve already had the container exit before because it was out of memory at the third QSs delete and apparently the memes about python garbage collection are true because it chugs along fine after a restart of the container. I&#39;ve read some blogs on slow delete performance and come to understand Django is doing a lot of

My implementation works only if websockets are available, Socket.io would be a library which would automatically switch between http polling &amp; ws and might be a great basis for liveupdates eventought might have scaling issues at &gt;10k users. ServerSent Events would be another possibility. I see a few projects which have tried this but all of them are outdated.</p> <p>Why isn&#39;t there a standardized way to do this? How are others doing it?</p> <p>Would there be interest in a package providing this functionality?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mlorin"> /u/mlorin

I consider moving to building web apps with Django - Python, and that the usage of scripting programming languages will grow, even though I like Java a lot. Do you think it&#39;s a good idea to move to Python completely, or should I study two web frameworks in two programming languages?
