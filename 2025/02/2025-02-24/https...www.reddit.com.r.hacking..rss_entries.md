## Can someone clone your car key's unlock signal by sitting next to your vehicle in a parking lot and waiting for you to come back to your car?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a 2013 Lexus that has that proximity unlock feature where you just need to walk up to it and pull the handle to unlock but it&#39;s also old enough that the key fob continuously broadcasts the unlock signal. I also have an obsessive manager that I&#39;m pretty sure has had private investigators follow me which leads me to today:</p> <p>I parked in a huge mall parking lot today to go get food and was only gone for 5 minutes but within that time someone parked right beside me even though I parked on the edge of all the cars and there were legitimately hundreds of spaces next to me.</p> <p>I was parked facing out and they were opposite so their driver door was right next to mine and the guy was leaned over so I couldn&#39;t see if he was holding anything. I was right beside his driver door briefly when getting into my car and was within 5 yards of him for about 15 seconds. Is that distance and time enough to copy the unlock signal for my car?</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a small old password protected ZIP file that was last modified back in 2001. In all likelihood, it was created using PKware on Windows 2000. I can&#39;t remember the password. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s less than 8 characters.</p> <p>I&#39;m in the midst of trying to educate myself on Zip2John and hashcat. I&#39;m hoping I can expedite the task by narrowing the search for hashes to the limited set available for ZIP files prior to 2002. Can anyone here confirm that set of hash types? I&#39;m thinking SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.

## Safest Way to Create Wireless IoT Testing Environment?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I’m looking for some input. I’m looking to begin testing wireless IoT devices for a project and would like to know what you think is the best method to isolate the testing environment so that the devices receive Wi-Fi via my ISP, but do not put devices on my main network at risk. This is a temporary project, so right now I’m considering purchasing a separate Wi-Fi router, connecting it to the modem and attaching the devices to that so that it’s completely isolated Vs Just segmenting the current router into its own VLAN for IoT testing purposes.</p> <p>What do you all think is the best way to go about this? Any ideas of your own? Is the seperate WiFi router overkill? This would ideally represent just an average joe’s network to demonstrate the dangers IoT devices pose on the network, but of course don’t want to put my main network at risk. TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Astronomica
