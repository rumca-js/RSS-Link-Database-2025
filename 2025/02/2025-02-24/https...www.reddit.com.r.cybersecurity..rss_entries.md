<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read alot of posts here regarding to cybersecurity job demands, is it really that bad as they say? to the point that fresh graduates cant even land a job? Im currently living in Canada and i plan to enroll in cybersecurity which has a Co-op program. I also looked into med school since it has more opportunities and easier job security but honestly I just dont see myself dealing with people, I just think that cybersecurity is best fit for me as I have dealt with programming before. Here are my questions</p> <p>1: for the fellow Canadians out there, is Cybersecurity a good course/program to have so you can secure a job easy? Basically, is it in demand?</p> <p>2: Are you going to be unemployed just as people say because of tough competition? I hope you guys could convince me otherwise. I would really like to work in cybersecurity but I wouldn&#39;t want to graduate without work at all.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m working on a project to evaluate the performance of <strong>post-quantum digital signature algorithms (DSA)</strong> compared to classical cryptographic mechanisms. The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> is actively developing quantum-resistant cryptography, including the <strong>liboqs</strong> library, which supports multiple DSA algorithms such as <strong>ML-DSA (NIST FIPS 204 standard), Kyber, RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519</strong>. My goal is to assess their efficiency and impact.</p> <p>I would like some insights on how I should structure my project effectively, I would also appreciate some insights on how I could answer the following:</p> <ol> <li>What is the expected performance of post-quantum DSA mechanisms?</li> <li>How does the overhead of post-quantum DSA compare to classical DSA?</li> <li>What are the key recommendations for transitioning from classical encryption mechanisms to post-quantum encryption
