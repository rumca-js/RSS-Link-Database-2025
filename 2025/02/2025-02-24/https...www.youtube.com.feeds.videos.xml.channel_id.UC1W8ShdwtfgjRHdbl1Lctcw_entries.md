I colorized, restored, and created a sound design for this  A Tour of Soviet Russia in the 1930s, offering a unique glimpse into the leningrad city’s streets, landmarks, and daily life during this era. This tour showcases the most iconic places and monuments of Soviet Russia, capturing the essence of its architecture, bustling neighborhoods, and the everyday activities of its population. From historic buildings to lively markets
