<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm a big reader myself but mainly stick to the horror genre and don‚Äôt read much else, so I wondered if anyone can advise on a book my BF might enjoy. </p> <p>He read and enjoyed the Alex Rider books when he was younger, but doesn‚Äôt read anymore. I think he would enjoy something Sci-Fi / thriller, something with a lot of action or twists maybe? If it helps, he‚Äôs mentioned to me how much he enjoyed the Gone Girl film, and that he‚Äôd like a book like that.

I‚Äôm looking to understand this more so I can grow and manage my emotions better.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I picked reading back up about 3 months ago and started with the Harry Potter series. I genuinely did not know I could love books so much. They‚Äôre the best stories and characters ever, but the problem is, I‚Äôm having trouble moving on to other decent books now. After finishing HP I read the Lincoln Lawyer books, The Midnight Library (recommended by ChatGPT lol), and Among the Bros (recommended by my mom). Out of those, The Lincoln Lawyer books have been decent, but nowhere near as gripping and exciting as HP. </p> <p>Did anybody go through this similar experience? I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs a book genre that I‚Äôm missing out on entirely that is like Harry Potter.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm trying to fall in love with fiction again. I learned to read at the age of 3 and have been an avid reader ever since. In my childhood, my favorite book series was <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>. I also loved adventure novels, such as <em>White Fang</em> by Jack London. As I grew older, my tastes evolved, balancing between adventure stories and works by authors like Camus, Hesse, and Sartre. I explored classic Russian literature and major American classics as well. However, over time, I started reading less and less. In the past few years, I‚Äôve only finished a few novels, mostly preferring non-fiction books about my profession, neuroscience, and psychology.</p> <p>Recently, I‚Äôve become fascinated with the outdoors, travel, scientific discoveries, and exploration.

I‚Äôve read a lot of the popular, trending ones- It Ends With Us, Verity, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, The Silent Patient, and others you‚Äôd typically find on the shelf at Target. They were entertaining, but most of them weren‚Äôt really my cup of tea- The Silent Patient was the only one that really stood out to me.</p> <p>On the other hand, I love TV shows and movies that explore weird, artificial realities and themes of surveillance and control. Severance is one of my favorite shows, and The Truman Show really stuck with me because of its eerie, manipulated reality. As for books, I love 1984 by George Orwell- something about the surveillance, manipulation, and totalitarian control just fascinates me. I‚Äôm drawn to stories that explore power, control, and the struggle for individual freedom in a world where reality is distorted.</p> <p>So, does anyone have

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>A few years ago I came across a book that sounded really interesting about mastering skills and learning things quickly.</p> <p>It was written but a guy (maybe a psychologist, not sure) that invented a method to master skills, he tested this method on his daughters in the 1920s (maybe) and they became super smart. I believe the book was called &quot;the method of...&quot; Or &quot;... method&quot;.</p> <p>I know this is a bit of a vague description but I can&#39;t find this book anywhere and don&#39;t know how it&#39;s called. Maybe someone has read it and will be able to guide me to it.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for all the input!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImlucasMLS"> /u/ImlucasMLS </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iwxva6/a_book_about_learning_and_mastering_skills_quickly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m floundering to start reading again. I have finished The Walking Dead graphic novels and I&#39;m waiting for both the novels and the Gunslinger to come into my library, but need to read to fill time in the meantime. I&#39;m really into apocalyptic stories, specifically zombie related of some sort. Other than that I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m looking for. A strong set of characters would be ideal as well, and something that isn&#39;t only ever serious, but also isn&#39;t nonstop jokes. It&#39;s stupidly hard to find books nowadays for someonne who hasn&#39;t in years and any suggestions are helpful.</p> <p>I know I&#39;m not looking for self help, and also not romance from the last five years. I&#39;d prefer adult novels, though YA isn&#39;t a no go, just no childrens. </p> <p>Some shows I enjoy if that&#39;s any help are The Walking Dead, Bojack Horseman, and Fallout. I haven&#39;t finished the Gunslinger yet, but I really enjoy it so 

## Children's books - for a teen/young adult

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working on a case of a 17 years old kid, who, on top of being an immigrant with a not-great grasp on language, never really had much of a childhood. We&#39;re trying to navigate both issues.</p> <p>So, we&#39;re looking for books that are easy enough for him to read through in a language he&#39;s not fluent in, but also be interesting enough for a teen to not feel like a chore. Bonus points if they&#39;re something you feel every kid needs to read.</p> <p>Books for teens also work, although I suspect most of them will be too difficult for him at the moment.</p> <p>He likes superheros, (mostly shounen) anime, pop science and true crime stuff, but isn&#39;t a huge fan of swords-and-sorcery style fantasy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adiantum-Veneris"> /u/Adiantum-Veneris </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iwx8oe/childrens_books_for_a_teenyoung_ad
