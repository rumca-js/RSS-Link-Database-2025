<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Well, the day has come. My 8TB external drive is failing, I can&#39;t open a folder anymore and I&#39;m getting a &quot;The parameter is incorrect&quot; error when I try to mount the drive. I ran chkdsk and recovered the filesystem enough to mount, but it&#39;s getting file read errors for some files now. Clearly it&#39;s ready to be put out of its misery. </p> <p>I don&#39;t want to bother doing a clone with ddrescue or something, so I started a Backblaze restore shipping me another hdd. It&#39;s just isos and videos anyways.</p> <p>Anything fun I can do with the slowly failing hard drive? Run chkdisk on it continuously and record the number of failures per run, and make a graph? Any better suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DepthHour1669"> /u/DepthHour1669 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ixfmw2/my_8tb_external_drive_is_failing/">[link]</a></spa

But for like $250 I could just get a low speced 730xd OR if anybody makes a 4u half depth DAS for 24 drives that would be awesome, but Likley way more expensive than reracking stuff to make room for a regular 2u to add to my rack. What gives, should I go disk shelf or add a whole nother server. I guess for the disk shelf I can keep it when I upgrade my r730 to an R750 in a few years? Or will at that point the 1200 feel obsolete as well. Maybe I should get an md3400?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently learned about the problem of used Seagate Exos drives being sold as new in Germany. I&#39;ve bought 3 16TB drives in January (via Amazon.de) and have checked the FARM data and all 3 have 20k+ (22k, 27k and 23k) hours of power-on.</p> <p>I&#39;ve managed to arrange mine to be returned, but now I have about of 9TB (can shrink it down to 8 maybe 7TB if need be) of data that I need to store while I get at least one new other drive. 2 of the drives are out of commission already, but my data is sitting on one of them.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking about these 2 options:</p> <ol> <li><p>Get a single new drive to start with (I&#39;m running Unraid) and just transfer my stuff over as I have ~2 weeks to return these.</p></li> <li><p>Store my data in some cloud storage for a month or so until I replace my large drives. But as far as I&#39;ve checked this can be really expensive really quickly even with stuff like S3 Deep Glacier Archive.
