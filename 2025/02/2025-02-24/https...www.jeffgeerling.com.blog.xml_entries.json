And by then it's usually too late! Luckily for me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.</p>\n\n<p>This week the power company emailed and said they'd be cutting power for maintenance next week, but they don't have an exact time. So it's even more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff Geerling</span></span>\n<span class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">February 24, 2025\n</span>",
