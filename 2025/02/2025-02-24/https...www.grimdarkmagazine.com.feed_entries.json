Our magazine has an absolute pile of original stories eligible for the awards. If you&#8217;ve read our issues and loved them, you could find a worse small publication to throw in a nomination for. I won&#8217;t be at WorldCon Seattle this year, but I am reasonably sure Beth and a few of the team will be. Hopefully our team can say g&#8217;day at some point!
