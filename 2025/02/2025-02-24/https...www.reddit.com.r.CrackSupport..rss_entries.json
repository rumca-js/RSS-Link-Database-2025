During my playthru I noticed the game won&#39;t let me save my progress(I did run the launcher as administrator tho). And I deleted my save file in game hoping it would have autosaved a new one(It didn&#39;t). When I rebooted the game all my progress is gone. And since I&#39;m already at chapter 3 I don&#39;t wanna start over. I&#39;m trying at the moment to download and load a save file but can&#39;t seem to find the save file folder. It simply doesn&#39;t exist. There is a bat file named Open Saves Location but it simply directs me to the general Documents location. I&#39;ve tried manually create a folder there and at C:\\Users\\Default\\AppData\\Roaming\\.1911\\Red Dead Redemption 2 as well, it didn&#39;t work either. Now I am genuinely confused.

Downloaded the game via qbittorrent and played it for a couple days. Malwarebytes pinged it a couple days later as Neshta.Virus.FileInfector.DDS and it had done some propagating and bricked a bunch of .exe files as typical of neshta virus. Had about 160 infected files which Malwarebytes quarantined and cleaned up. </p> <p>Anyways a painful full scan via Malwarebytes + Defenders + rkill + sfc /scannow + AVG Remover for Win32/Neshta (this was sorta useless as it&#39;s targetting a different virus but better safe) later, I think I&#39;m in the clear and can avoid doing a full reinstall but just a warning to you all out there. Still bricked a bunch of programs I now need to reinstall.</p> <p>My fault for not checking the hashes since I downloaded via qbittorent.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
