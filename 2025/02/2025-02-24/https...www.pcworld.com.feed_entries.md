<p>A long time ago in a consumer market not so far away, $700 could get you a top-of-the-line graphics card. Today, $750 (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2609226/early-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-listings-stoke-sticker-shock-but-dont-panic-yet.html">or more</a>) only gets you Nvidia’s bronze medal card, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2612343/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review.html">RTX 5070 Ti</a>. But how does it compare to the GTX 1080 Ti, which launched at $700 in 2017 and is widely considered the greatest graphics card of all time? Adam and Will decided to find out in the latest PCWorld video on YouTube.</p>



<p>Eight years is an eternity in the graphics card space, so even though the 1080 Ti was the big daddy of its time, conventional wisdom says that it should pale in comparison to the 5070 Ti four generations later. And yeah, that bears 

## Perplexity teases Comet, an AI browser for ‘agentic search’

<p>Search, AI, browsers: all three technologies naturally mix together. So it should be no surprise that AI-powered search engine, Perplexity AI, is teasing its entry into the browser market with “Comet.”</p>



<p>Perplexity isn’t saying much. All we know of Comet is that Perplexity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/perplexity-teases-a-web-browser-called-comet/">announced it</a> via Twitter/X on Monday morning. The company calls Comet “a browser for agentic search.” It revealed no other details.</p>



<p>Perplexity hopes to be the next Google; it’s one of numerous <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2584042/beyond-copilot-13-helpful-ai-tools-for-pc-users.html">AI-powered tools</a> that users can take advantage of. The company claims that its artificial intelligence gives users a more relevant search experience than other browsers, some of whic

## Microsoft launches a free version of Office, but with ads, report says

<p>If you’ve messed around with Microsoft’s “free” Office web app, you’ve quickly discovered that it stinks, for one important reason: You can’t actually create documents. A new, free, ad-supported local version of Office changes all that, according to a report.</p>



<p>If a new <a href="https://beebom.com/microsoft-free-ad-supported-office-quietly-launched/">report from Beebom</a> is accurate, this new version of Office basically takes many of the basic features Microsoft has included in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and makes them available for free. The one catch is a minor one: You’ll need to save your created document to OneDrive, but you’re then free to re-download it like any other file. Some of the more advanced features are excluded, too.</p>



<p>Microsoft is simply referring to the new service as the “free” version of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint,

<p>With around 1.8 billion active users worldwide, Gmail remains the most popular email service by far. Google was also one of the first to pioneer and popularize two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>



<p>You know those text messages with one-time numerical codes that you need to enter whenever you want to log in? Turns out, while 2FA itself is a great way to protect your online security, the SMS method for delivering codes is not. In fact, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2424573/watch-out-hackers-is-two-factor-login-insecure.html">hackers can bypass SMS 2FA</a>.</p>



<p>And that’s why Google is changing up the Gmail login process. According to an exclusive report by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/23/exclusive-google-confirms-gmail-to-ditch-sms-code-authentication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>, G

More than a few buyers of new RTX 50-series GPUs are feeling that right now after reports of missing ROPs on brand-new cards. According to a new statement, it’s a manufacturing defect — and it’s covered under warranty.</p>



<p>A ROP is a “Render Output Unit” and there are supposed to be 176 of them on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">RTX 5090</a> and 96 on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2612343/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review.html">RTX 5070 Ti</a>.

<p>Most users are familiar with Windows Defender (the antivirus tool built into <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398361/windows-security-av-review.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/398361/windows-security-av-review.html">Windows Security</a>), which continuously monitors the system for suspicious software activity and also identifies and blocks dangerous intruders based on a database of virus definitions.</p>



<p>However, no antivirus software can prevent users from installing programs that open up access to the PC like the Greek warriors with their Trojan horse.</p>



<p>To prevent this, it is advisable to whitelist the basic configuration of the computer. Whitelisting means that you, as administrator, create a list of all permitted programs.</p>

<p>I always thought that buying a 4K webcam was only something that streamers and influencers should care about. I mean, how much better am I <em>really</em> going to look when I’m on a Teams call with my editors, or on a Skype call with my mom? It seemed quite silly to think about.</p>



<p>But I’ve been playing around with several webcam options to see what difference they actually make to everyday video calls and meetings — and as it turns out, there are some real positives with 4K webcams. There are some negatives, too. (And I don’t just mean that suddenly everyone can see that pimple you didn’t bother to cover up.)</p>



<p>Here’s what I’ve learned about why 4K webcams can be worth buying (and why they might not be) depending on your needs and use cases.</p>

<p>Windows is generally pretty safe, but the internet is a dangerous place full of malware that’ll infect your devices if you aren’t careful. One thing you can do to stay safe is to make sure you’re using the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2379676/is-windows-11s-built-in-antivirus-enough-for-normal-everyday-users.html">built-in antivirus features of Windows</a>, which are better than nothing.</p>
