<p>The soul singer was ambitiously diverse in her musicianship, and enthralled at every turn – whether doing desolate folk cover versions or lighter, sophisticated pop</p><p>In the liner notes to 2023’s Lost Takes – which excavated the tapes that had served as Roberta Flack’s audition for Atlantic Records over half a century earlier – poet Harmony Holiday wrote that Flack possessed “the voice of the idyllic afterlife you’d want to arrive in after the end of a dysfunctional world”.</p><p>Indeed, Flack sang like she was equally conversant with the ecstasy of faith and the agony of life. The dignified richness of her vocal was tempered by the subtly volcanic power she displayed on her reading of To Sir With Love off Lost Takes – a not-so-quiet fire that always resided within her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/24/roberta-flacks-performances-softly-burned-with-the-fire-of-life-itself">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 22-year-old is an elite player. How might he react if the Blues miss out on Champions League qualification again?</p><p>Remember those chants of “We’ve got our Chelsea back” when Enzo Maresca’s side thumped Southampton at St Mary’s in December? Life moves quickly in west London. Two months have passed since those heady days, back when the talk was of a burgeoning title challenge, and the mood at Stamford Bridge has fractured so rapidly that the theme of a protest against the owners before their home game against Southampton on Tuesday night is – wait for it – “We want our Chelsea back”.</p><p>It may seem an overreaction to a dip in form. Even so it is not hard to find fans who feel a growing disconnection with the club and struggle to understand Chelsea’s youth-driven recruitment strategy. They sense that the change pushed by the majority shareholder, Clearlake Capital, has been too intense; that too much knowledge has left the building since the end of the Roman Abramovich er

My friend’s father – most everyone’s father or mother or uncle, whoever – would, while on business trips overseas, visit the occasional video store or flea market and return with whatever films or books or albums they happened to find. It’s a haphazard, incomplete thing to consume the culture of a faraway place in this manner, like trying to divine the contours of a mouth from the texture of spittle.</p><p>Red Dawn<em> </em>is a bad movie. Bad in a special, sincere kind of way. It’s about a bunch of teenagers who fight back against a Soviet invasion of the United States. Released in the early 80s, it belongs to a large fraternity of films in which scrappy underdog Americans fight back against the seemingly insurmountable but of
