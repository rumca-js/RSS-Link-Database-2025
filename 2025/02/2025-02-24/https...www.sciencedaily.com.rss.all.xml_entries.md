Researchers are exploring the use of a new drug called ataciguat to manage AVS. Results from preclinical and clinical studies show that ataciguat has the potential to significantly slow disease progression.

## How humans learn to optimize working memory

Working memory is what allows humans to juggle different pieces of information in short-term scenarios, like making a mental grocery list and then going shopping or remembering and then dialing a phone number. While scientists agree that the capacity of working memory is limited, they offer competing theories about how and why this is true. But new research shows why limits on working memory exist.

## Study shows primary care and telehealth can deliver life-changing diabetes care

## Genetic evidence that diabetes drug GLP-1 receptor agonists achieve weight loss primarily by reducing fat mass more than muscle
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250224111937.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250224111937.htm)

Diabetes and obesity have become pressing health issues worldwide. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, a class of medications widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), have shown significant effectiveness in both lowering blood sugar levels and aiding weight loss due to their unique pharmacological mechanisms. A research team assessed the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist in weight loss through genetic studies, aiming to understand whether the use of these medications reduces weight due to muscle or fat mass loss. This genetic study revealed that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce weight by reducing more fat mass than muscle mass.

The gut bacteria of giraffes are not primarily determined by what they eat, but by the species they belong to. This is shown in a new study in which researchers have analyzed the link between diet and gut flora in three giraffe species in Kenya. The study also provides new knowledge that can help secure the food supply of endangered giraffe species.

## Mega-iceberg from Antarctica on collision course with South Georgia: Harbinger of things to come?

It is no strange sight to see icebergs break off of the Antarctic ice cap and drift away, like the gigantic sheet of ice that is currently heading for the island of South Georgia. But climate change is making it happen more frequently, with ever-larger icebergs in the waters around Antarctica. Researchers are studying the routes that icebergs followed during geological periods of rapid ice cap deterioration, such as the ends of ice ages. That provides crucial information about the effect of melting icebergs on the oceans, and its consequences for the future. In the process, they also found an explanation for the mysterious discovery of ancient material from Antarctica near South Orkney, an island to the southwest of South Georgia.
