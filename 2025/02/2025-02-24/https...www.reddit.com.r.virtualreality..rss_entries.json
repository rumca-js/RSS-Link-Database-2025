I&#39;m completely new to VR, I&#39;ve played VRchat on my windows 11 desktop, but it&#39;s quite old and the specs are terrible even on the lowest settings. Since I&#39;ve found the game fun I want to play it more, but playing it on my PC is absolute hell and like nails on a chalkboard, not only that, but I can&#39;t really do any fun stuff like play with the jiggle physics on my avatar, lol.</p> <p>Getting to the point, I wonder if I can&#39;t connect a headset to a smart TV if I ever get one in the future? I don&#39;t have a nice console like a Playstation or anything of the sort so that might be a problem, but I have several different kinds of smart TVs around the place and I wonder if it depends?<br/> If not, that makes a lot of sense.

However, now the meta quest link app is telling me my pc doesn&#39;t meet minimum specs. I ran a powershell line (gci &quot;${env:localappdata}\\Oculus\\PerfLog*.json&quot;|sort LastWriteTime|select -L 1|sls &#39;lt_str&#39;|select Line) and it sai that VideoCardResult_str was a fail, essentially meaning my card doesn&#39;t meet the minimum requirements for VR. On top of that, it runs essentially the same as my GTX 1060. Is this a known issue with Radeon GPUs or is it just a coding error on Meta&#39;s part and am I not using the full power of my GPU?</p> <pre><code>gci &quot;${env:localappdata}\\Oculus\\PerfLog*.json&quot;|sort LastWriteTime|select -L 1|sls &#39;lt_str&#39;|select Line </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON",

Enjoying it so far but wanting to upgrade my PC to try to squeeze a bit more performance out of it. </p> <p>Currently have a 5800x3d, 32gb RAM, and a 7900xtx. My choices in my opinion are to either upgrade my CPU to AM5 (9800x3d or 7800x3d) with all associated or try to snag a 5090/used 4090. </p> <p>I mainly play sim games for VR (particularly racing sims) and was a bit unsure of which would lead towards a better performance increase. That and of course the cost associated with going the GPU route would be a good bit more expensive. I do also know neither will give massive improvements considering my current setup.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any advice! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zohninja\"> /u/zohninja </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ixbp60/whi",
