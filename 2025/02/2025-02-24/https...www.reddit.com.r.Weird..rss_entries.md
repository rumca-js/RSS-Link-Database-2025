The book was printed in 1962 and has a signature/date on the front cover (I can’t quite make it out) and a sticker from Vroman’s in Pasadena. </p> <p>I am aware that tourism developed after the 80s, but I can’t imagine it was very popular in reality. The subject matter of the book also seems very fitting. Who could have owned it, and how did North Korean stamps end up inside? Can anyone make out the signature?</p> </di
