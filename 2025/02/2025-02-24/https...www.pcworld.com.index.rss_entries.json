It\u2019s fragrant because there\u2019s scented oil inside of it. That\u2019s it. Go home. After 50 years, we\u2019ve reached the pinnacle of PC mouse perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, fine, I guess I should write a little bit about it. The mouse part of the Fragrance Mouse MD101 is pretty basic, with two primary buttons, a scroll wheel, and a 2,400 DPI sensor. No thumb buttons or gamer extras. You get dual-mode wireless with Bluetooth and a 2.4GHz USB dongle that stows away in the body, right next to the single AA battery. It comes in pink and white colors, with a little swoopy indent in the plastic that makes me think of a Glade air freshener. I wonder why.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"uploadedSrc\":false,\"figureClassNames\":\"wp-block-image size-la",
