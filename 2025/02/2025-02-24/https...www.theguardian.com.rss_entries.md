<p>Actor who found fame in shabby attire creates pop culture moment on last night of London fashion week</p><p>Thirty-eight years after his film career began in a swaggeringly shabby coat in Withnail and I, Richard E Grant gave us another pop culture moment at the last show of London fashion week, modelling a rather smarter olive tweed number on the Burberry catwalk.</p><p>A starry line-up at Tate Britain on Monday also included White Lotus’s Jason Isaacs and Lesley Manville (Naomi Campbell was relegated to the supporting cast.) It was the heartwarming feelgood ending that a muted London fashion week badly needed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/24/from-withnail-to-with-style-richard-e-grant-steals-show-on-burberry-catwalk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sobering but compelling, the latest powerhouse documentary from Norma Percy spans decades, speaks to everyone that matters – and proves to be vital viewing</p><p>The problem with calling a television programme Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October is that that is a hell of a long road to retrace. Where would a series like this begin? The formation of Hamas? The six-day war? Suez? 1948? 1917? Earlier?</p><p>The producer of this film, Norma Percy, has taken a more modern approach. Percy’s strongest skill as a documentary-maker has always been her ability to secure access to the people who matter, such as Gerald Ford for 1994’s Watergate series and Slobodan Milošević for 1995’s The Death of Yugoslavia. Given that the authors of the Balfour declaration – a letter written by the British government in 1917 supporting the creation of a Jewish homeland – are all long dead, Percy has decided to venture back only two decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-ra

<p>The PM will not and should not pick a fight with the president. But it is his duty to go there upholding British and European values</p><p>Day by day another vast hole opens up beneath what was once solid. The man who is on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, once the most pro-US of leaders, has declared Nato in effect over. In his clear-eyed perception of Donald Trump’s first month, 80 years of shared transatlantic values have fallen into that crater. The US “doesn’t care about the fate of Europe one way or another” and Washington’s actions have been “no less drastic, dramatic, and ultimately no less brazen” than Moscow’s, he said. Now, Europe must defend itself.</p><p>The moment smacks of that 1940 David Low cartoon of a British soldier standing on a rock in a stormy sea, shaking his fist as the Luftwaffe approach: “Very well, alone”.

The visual gag was that the rag nag ends up riding a real one. “So the horse had to be in the scene,” recalls Holland. “But it took rather an interest in the pantomime one and started sniffing around its hindquarters. Su said words to the effect of, ‘Oh, eck!’ and asked for help. But I’m afraid all I could say was, ‘You’d better brace yourself, Su.

<p>The toned-down radio DJ might be a safe bet to take over from Lauren Laverne – but wall-to-wall bangers and a UB40 song request from a listener enjoying a heroic breakfast make for a merry start to the day</p><p></p><p>Breakfast radio hosts are like spouses, colleagues, siblings and parents: they can be really, really annoying. It’s often a matter of timing – you might find a certain presenter grating at seven in the morning, but the same one prattling on after lunch totally inoffensive. Yet such a visceral, borderline irrational reaction does make the early morning slot a dicey endeavour. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/nick-grimshaw">Nick Grimshaw</a> will already be well aware of this occupational hazard as he takes over the 6 Music breakfast show from Lauren Laverne – he helmed Radio 1’s more high-profile equivalent between 2012 and 2018. As he kicks off his debut programme with the kind of hushed reverence that has long been de rigueur on the station, it’s obvious

## The big idea: what do we really mean by free speech?

<p>Social media bosses are suddenly all for it, but can we take their enthusiasm at face value?</p><p>Free speech is in permacrisis – or so some would have you believe. Complaints that freedom of speech is under attack come mostly from the political right, from public figures who appear to the naked eye to be <em>extremely</em> free to say and do what they like, and see no irony in doing so via platforms with vast audiences.</p><p>These vigorous defenders of free speech also often have a curiously narrow set of interests over which they wish to exercise it. Far from the noble anti-authoritarian roots of the British liberal tradition, these figures – Nigel Farage, for example – prefer to use their platforms to punch down, often against already persecuted minority groups. Rather than wanting freer speech, what they actually want is freedom from the consequences of broadcasting their views.

It’s telling that nine out of the 10 nominees are essentially set in the past, or in isolated or fantasy realms, from 1960s America (A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys) to “Mexico” (Emilia Pérez, filmed in France), from Wicked’s Oz to Dune: Part Two’s Arrakis. Only one entry is set in genuine, here-and-now, modern-day society. What’s more, Anora goes to places mainstream cinema rarely does: the grubby streets, the strip clubs, the all-night cafes, off-season Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and the Russian and Armenian communities who live there. Anora also gives us the opposite: gated mansions, deluxe hotel suites, private jets. That’s the kind of

At the end, he laughed and said: ‘I am the real Crazy Taxi!’ It was a strange experience.”</p><p>Initially released in arcades, the zany, pop-punk drive-em’-up celebrates its 25th anniversary this month. Crazy Taxi was an addictive coin-swallowing thrill ride, the game’s eccentric cabbies continually yelling “Ready to have some fun?” and “Time to make some crazy money!” in the faces of perturbed-looking normies who simply wish to be chauffeured over to Pizza Hut.

<p>The Paper, Ron Howard’s underappreciated 1994 comedy drama, is latest in our series in which writers highlight their favourite comfort films</p><p>I can’t claim to like many Ron Howard films. And probably few of his devoted fans count The Paper, the director’s 1994 comedy-drama about a day in the life of a New York tabloid, among their favourites. It is, at best, a three-star film, which received mixed reviews and has faded from memory – but it’s also a perfect mid-range movie featuring adults. The much-lamented genre of not very serious but not stupid, well-crafted films in the non-spandex-or-franchise cinematic universe.</p><p>This, to me, is the essence of a feelgood film: it’s a crisp 112 minutes, it doesn’t strain for awards or grandeur, it has drama and humour, and fine actors you recognise. Perhaps previously it would have simply been called middlebrow. Sometimes that’s just what you need.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/24/the-paper-feelgood-movie">C

<p>Melancholy documentary follows the owner of a ‘night moving’ business in Japan, helping people abandon their own lives</p><p>‘Johatsu” means evaporation in Japanese, and is used to refer to those people who choose to disappear, severing all ties with their past lives and their families. It became a phenomenon in Japan in the 1960s, and intensified during the 1990s as the country struggled with a debt crisis. While some plot their departures on their own, others call on the services of “night movers”: companies that help people vanish without trace.</p><p>Following the owner of one such business named Saita, Andreas Hartmann’s and Arata Mori’s poignant documentary surveys the circumstances that drive people to desperate measures. Unfolding like a suspense thriller, the opening sees a man hurriedly get inside Saita’s van, his voice trembling with fear. Unable to cope with a possessive partner, he finally manages to flee.

<p>This fly-on-the-wall series about the actor’s family in the lead up to the Rust trial feels in extremely poor taste. It’s entirely unnecessary television that makes the actor and his wife look dreadful</p><p>I think there are two options here that will allow ourselves to continue our lives without collapsing into total despair. The first is that a secret cell of revolutionary communists has successfully infiltrated the commissioning corridors of the Discovery channel and created its new reality show The Baldwins as a weapon to bring down western capitalism. It stars Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, their seven children and eight pets as they negotiate their chaotic family life split between their Manhattan apartment and East Hampton summer home, with two nannies and a lot of talk about love and “choosing to grow” through problems. Within 20 minutes or so I expect most of us will be prepared to man the barricades.</p><p>The second is that The Baldwins is actually a covert addition to the

<p>A vivid outback tale, an anguished 80s love triangle and real life are cleverly held in play in the Australian novelist’s inventive memoir-novel-essay hybrid</p><p>This book starts as an evocative, shifting novel of time and place: a young man travelling in Switzerland, distracted by thoughts of a beautiful music teacher he met in London, recalls how, in his Australian childhood, he was evacuated to live with his grandparents at a sheep station in New South Wales in the second world war. There follows a brief story of how the boy that he was pocketed an emerald ring owned by his grandmother and chucked it away in the nearby woods. The shame did not end there. A young Aboriginal maid was blamed for the theft, and he did not have the courage to step in to save her from dismissal.</p><p>Just as you are losing yourself in this immersive little story, however, its author, Michelle de Kretser, steps in to inform you that “at this point, the novel I was writing stalled”. She goes on to e

<p>The sooner the US’s former friends realise the old global order is over, the sooner they can organise to regain power and agency – the only language Trump understands</p><p>A resonant phrase during Donald Trump’s first administration was the advice to take him “seriously, but not literally”. It was a singularly detrimental expression, <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/donald-trump-seriously-not-literally-emily-thornberry-following-inauguration/">widely quoted by politicians</a> and the media.

<p>When outrageous clubbers Sue Tilley and Bowery posed for the eminent artist, some of the most spectacular portraits of the century were born. Tilley talks about sex, cash and Bowery’s untimely death</p><p>‘Leigh would have been livid that it wasn’t a painting of him that broke the record,” says Sue Tilley with a laugh. She’s talking about the £17.2m paid by Roman Abramovich in 2008 for a Lucian Freud nude of her, called Benefits Supervisor Sleeping. It was then the highest price ever paid for work by a living artist and Tilley thinks Leigh Bowery, the fashion icon and performance artist, would have found a way to claim the credit. After all, it was Bowery, her great friend, who got her the modelling job.</p><p>Tilley is now repaying the debt by telling the Australian’s story in a new edition of her book Leigh Bowery: The Life and Times of an Icon, featuring never-before-seen photos and an extra chapter on his legacy. You can’t really understand Bowery – his looks, his performances

<p>She won hearts with True Romance – and an Oscar for Boyhood. The actor reflects on her TV show Severance, political chaos in the US and why human beings are a disaster</p><p>If escaping the world by running for the hills looks increasingly attractive to many of us – perhaps living on a commune – Patricia Arquette feels like that too. Head to the mountains, she says. “Plant seeds and farm.” But maybe not the commune part – she lived in one as a child and it wasn’t always utopian. If our conversation is more dystopian than usual, it’s probably because we’re talking about Severance, the hit Apple TV+ show now in its second season. In the first series, we were introduced to Lumon Industries, where some workers, tasked with doing something unknown but probably malevolent with data, were willingly “severed”; their work selves detached from their outside selves, with no memory between the two. If the drama started as an off-kilter take on work-life balance, it soon morphed into something
