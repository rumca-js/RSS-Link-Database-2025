And probably few of his devoted fans count The Paper, the director\u2019s 1994 comedy-drama about a day in the life of a New York tabloid, among their favourites. It is, at best, a three-star film, which received mixed reviews and has faded from memory \u2013 but it\u2019s also a perfect mid-range movie featuring adults. The much-lamented genre of not very serious but not stupid, well-crafted films in the non-spandex-or-franchise cinematic universe.</p><p>This, to me, is the essence of a feelgood film: it\u2019s a crisp 112 minutes, it doesn\u2019t strain for awards or grandeur, it has drama and humour, and fine actors you recognise. Perhaps previously it would have simply been called middlebrow. Sometimes that\u2019s just what you need.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/24/the-paper-feelgood-movie\">C",
