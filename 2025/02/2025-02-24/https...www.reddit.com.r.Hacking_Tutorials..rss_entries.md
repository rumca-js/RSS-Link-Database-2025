<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>See,, I have this camera at home, and I want to make it my lab rat, so I was experimenting and trying to find out, like, some type of python code able to be executed, and it pings the camera, which slows it down. How do you do that? I promise this isn&#39;t for bad intentions; I have, like, proof if you guys want it, like pics of the cam or, like, the MAC address or the IP, so I just need help on how to make that and how to turn it into an executable to run automatically. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional_Page_1094"> /u/Additional_Page_1094 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ixey6m/coding_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ixey6m/coding_help/">[comments]</a></span>
