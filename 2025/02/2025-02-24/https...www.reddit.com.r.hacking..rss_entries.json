I also have an obsessive manager that I&#39;m pretty sure has had private investigators follow me which leads me to today:</p> <p>I parked in a huge mall parking lot today to go get food and was only gone for 5 minutes but within that time someone parked right beside me even though I parked on the edge of all the cars and there were legitimately hundreds of spaces next to me.</p> <p>I was parked facing out and they were opposite so their driver door was right next to mine and the guy was leaned over so I couldn&#39;t see if he was holding anything. I was right beside his driver door briefly when getting into my car and was within 5 yards of him for about 15 seconds. Is that distance and time enough to copy the unlock signal for my car?</p>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, I\u2019m looking for some input. I\u2019m looking to begin testing wireless IoT devices for a project and would like to know what you think is the best method to isolate the testing environment so that the devices receive Wi-Fi via my ISP, but do not put devices on my main network at risk. This is a temporary project, so right now I\u2019m considering purchasing a separate Wi-Fi router, connecting it to the modem and attaching the devices to that so that it\u2019s completely isolated Vs Just segmenting the current router into its own VLAN for IoT testing purposes.</p> <p>What do you all think is the best way to go about this? Any ideas of your own? Is the seperate WiFi router overkill? This would ideally represent just an average joe\u2019s network to demonstrate the dangers IoT devices pose on the network, but of course don\u2019t want to put my main network at risk. TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Astronomica",
