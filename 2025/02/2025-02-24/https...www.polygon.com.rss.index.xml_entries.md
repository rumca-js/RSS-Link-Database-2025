<p class="has-text-align-none">Publisher Annapurna Interactive held its big annual games showcase on Monday, during which it revealed much more about its upcoming slate. That includes new release dates for games like <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777644/to-a-t-keita-takahashi-uvula-annapurna-interactive">to a T</a></em> from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi and <em>Skin Deep</em> from Blendo Games, as well as new looks at <em>Wheel World</em> (née <em>Ghost Bike</em>) and <em>Wanderstop</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In even better news, you can play some of those games right now, thanks to new demos that have dropped as part of Steam Next Fest. There’s even a fun new shadow drop for Pl

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s somehow been 20 years since the first Twilight Saga book was released, and Little Brown Books is celebrating by releasing three special editions on Sept.  30 — pre-orders for which are all currently discounted on Amazon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As someone who went to Twilight midnight release parties for the books and movies, I have a lot of nostalgia for the franchise. That’s why my favorite of the special editions is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316592986">20th anniversary paperback edition</a> of <em>Twilight</em>, which maintains the iconic original cover art of black and white hands cradling a red apple. </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23400643/andor-best-star-wars">Andor</a></em> season 2 is finally here… and looks like a lot of fun? Despite being depressing as hell?</p>

<p>The Star Wars series was planned by creator Tony Gilroy as a two-season, 24-episode series. While various hiccups have delayed the series, including Gilroy’s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wgaeast/video/7271379864463215914">frankly inspiring involvement</a> in the 2023 WGA strike, the back half of <em>Andor</em> is finally in the can and ready to release this April. And the first trailer for season 2 rocks in unexpected ways — thanks in large part to Steve Earle’s rollicking tune “The Revolution Starts Now.”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Since his first appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) has been intrinsically connected to the military. Running alongside Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), trying to keep up with the super-serum-powered superhero, Sam was introduced as a veteran who ran a counseling group for his fellow soldiers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The comics gave him a falcon sidekick named Redwing, but Marvel Studios replaced his loyal bird with a high-tech drone created by the U.S. military. And his signature wingsuit also came courtesy of the American government. So MCU fans may find it surprising to learn that the comic book origin of Captain America’s eventual
