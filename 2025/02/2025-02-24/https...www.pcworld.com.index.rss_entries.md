<p>Ever feel like tech support systems are designed to frustrate you, perhaps in the hope that you’ll just give up and stop trying? For HP, that was literally the case. It’s been confirmed that the company had a mandatory 15-minute wait period for all support calls in the UK and other countries. The policy has since, allegedly, been removed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/20/hp_deliberately_adds_15_minutes/">The Register reports</a> that it saw an internal policy document for HP’s support team in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Italy, which said that everyone who called in for tech support for PCs and printers would have a minimum wait time of 15 minutes before getting through to a human operator. The idea was to “influence customers to increase their adoption of digital self-serve,” essentially forcing people to inte

<p>Asus just announced its newest mouse design, the Asus Fragrance Mouse. It’s fragrant because there’s scented oil inside of it. That’s it. Go home. After 50 years, we’ve reached the pinnacle of PC mouse perfection.</p>



<p>Okay, fine, I guess I should write a little bit about it. The mouse part of the Fragrance Mouse MD101 is pretty basic, with two primary buttons, a scroll wheel, and a 2,400 DPI sensor. No thumb buttons or gamer extras. You get dual-mode wireless with Bluetooth and a 2.4GHz USB dongle that stows away in the body, right next to the single AA battery. It comes in pink and white colors, with a little swoopy indent in the plastic that makes me think of a Glade air freshener. I wonder why.</p>

<p>If you know the meaning of desk discomfort, then you can’t afford to skimp on your chair. You know, the thing you sit in for nearly one-third of your day? A proper chair can make all the difference.</p>



<p>And if you don’t want to shell out a ton of cash on premium office chairs, then here’s one worth trying: the Staples Emerge Vortex, which is <a href="https://www.staples.com/staples-emerge-vortex-bonded-leather-gaming-chair-black-and-gray-52503/product_2829477">now on sale for $120</a> instead of its original $270 price. That’s 55 percent off!</p>



<p>While marketed as a gaming chair, this one’s understated enough to fit well into any home office. It comes with a tall back, lumbar support, a padded headrest, and flip-up armrests that make it easy to push in under your desk when you’re done for the day. The Emerge Vortex is also sturdy enough to supp

<p>AI is the hot buzzword in tech. We’re hearing it repeatedly from major tech companies, as they integrate AI models into their products. The latest company to trumpet the inclusion: Google, in its Chrome browser.</p>

The opt-in program received an official boost from AI, which Google says aids the detection of internet dangers.</p>



<p>Details have yet to be shared of how exactly the AI screening works, which mirrors another piece of news that involves Chrome and its password manager. As sha
