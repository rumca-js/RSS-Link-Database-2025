At the end of the game we usually have something between 10 and 15 birds, all of which add something to our engine. And by the end of the game our experience will differ quite a lot. </p> <p>Now back to Parks. We only played twice and I think we enjoyed it for the most part but also saw our concerns confirmed.

Now, I&#39;m all in. What I&#39;ve noticed is that I find it incredibly difficult to learn a game that I haven&#39;t taught myself, usually by reading the rules AND watching a video where It&#39;s taught and/or played. When I&#39;m taught the rules, as in I&#39;m sitting down to a game with a group and about to play it for the first time, I find it hard to grasp and remember rules, and don&#39;t always understand what the application of rules and actions are at all during my first game. When I do understand the game, I still lose, significantly, 99% of the time. Some examples:</p> <ul> <li><p>I played Harmonies for the first time, didn&#39;t know what tiles I should be picking, the player aid boggled me, and I ended the game with just two ",
