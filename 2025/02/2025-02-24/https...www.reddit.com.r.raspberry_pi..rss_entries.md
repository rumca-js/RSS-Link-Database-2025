When I unplug it, the original monitor flickers back on as though there is no issue. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been unable to find any ways to get around this.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I have an older lcd tv in the garage and would like to plug a RPI device via hdmi or composite cables to it where it does Winamp style music visualizations on the tv. An external mic is needed to listen to the room’s sound to visualize from. A small device like this you might even be able to sell to others. I’d also like for it to not lose programming if turned on or off as if it is a regular consumer type device. Can someone do this for me? What would it cost? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooBunnies3323"> /u/SnooBunnies3323 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iwthv0/can_someone_build_me_a_music_visualizer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iwthv0/can_someone_build_me_a_music_visualizer/">[comments]</a></span>

## Is there a way to turn a Pi 400/500 into a "smart keyboard"?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found a few historical posts from people who wanted to turn a Pi 400 into just a regular keyboard, but I&#39;m trying to find out if there&#39;s a way to have the Pi remain functional as a computer while being able to pass keyboard inputs to a connected different computer somehow. The idea there is I could use it to either type normally, or pre-write scripts that could be sent over with a single button press while keeping the keyboard form factor and functionality. A couple of the more recent mentions also bring up something called &quot;gadget mode&quot;, but as far as I can tell that&#39;s a way to control a Pi <em>from</em> a connected computer and not the other way around.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Railgun5"> /u/Railgun5 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iwsxuo/is_there_a_way_to_turn_a_pi_400500_into_a_smart/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa
