<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading The Brockets on kobo recently (though I found the audiobook version on YT also). It revolves around the misadventures of an over the top mother, probably intended as a caricature (parody?) of Jane Austen&#39;s legendary Mrs Bennet. I would recommend it as a fun, light read for anyone who likes a modern take on regency period humour, with over the top, absurd situations the family find themselves in each chapter. The book most definitely does not take itself seriously.</p> <p>It got me thinking of other books (and a few plays) I&#39;ve particularly enjoyed, which also feature what I like to term as &quot;Menacing Mothers&quot;, so thought I&#39;d start off a thread for this niche, to get your recommendations for further reading. </p> <p>They can be mainstream or obscure. And if you can give an example of what you think made the mother a menace, add that in as an example too. </p> <p>Now, when I say a menace, I guess I mean a moth

So the women in the story aren&#39;t treated well and violence against them is rampant, the women of the story are either sexual objects or just there to be mistreated.</p> <p>I would say surprisingly for that era there is almost no racism in the novel.

I&#39;ve been looking to get into more Japanese literature beyond just whatever I&#39;ve read from Haruki Murakami, and this book came highly recommended.</p> <p>It&#39;s a pretty short and quick read, but it&#39;s one that&#39;s stayed on my mind since I finished it. The premise is simple yet compelling - a Japanese entomologist travels to a fishing village on the coast to do some research. Something is off about this place - huge sand dunes have pretty much taken over the entire village. He misses his last bus back into town, and is forced to accept lodging in a small house at the bottom of a huge sand pit, where the titular woman of the story also lives. The next morning, he wakes up to find the ladder he took into the pit to be gone - and the villagers won&#39;t let him out.</p> <p>What follows is a uni

Despite it&#39;s problems in (what I believe to be) the Holy Trinity of Cold War gone hot novels (Red Storm Rising, Team Yankee, and Chieftains), I still think that Red Storm Rising is the best of them. One of the first action movies I can remember in it&#39;s entirety is We Were Soldiers and the way it portrayed the NVA as not faceless villains but tough and clever opponents who were half a step ahead of the Americans was amazing to me, and RSR just hits that same itch. The Soviets and Americans are both shown at the peak of their capabilities going tit for tat, bringing out novel technologies and tactics that catch their enemies off guard even as their commanders flounder with an impartial picture of events despite bringing everything from foot scouts to reconnaissance satellites to bear.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few months ago I watched a Booktok about a book I had never heard of previously and the premise was something I would not normally read. But the review was intriguing and so I started reading “Dungeon Crawler Carl”. I have basically done nothing since but read the series. I’m on the fourth book now. </p> <p>This book is crazy weird but delightful and imaginative. The author Matt Dinniman writes without rules which provides a refreshing and surprising story line. </p> <p>I haven’t heard many people talking about it, and like I mentioned before, the premise is wacky so I just had to come on here and sing its praises! Read it if you haven’t! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mounta1anmama"> /u/Mounta1anmama </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iwoip9/do_not_sleep_on_dungeon_crawler_carl/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i
