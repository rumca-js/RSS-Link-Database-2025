<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I might delete this later but this is just so confusing. I&#39;m in a bit of a situation. I (18M) am transgender and my boyfriend (18M) is cisgender. We&#39;ve been together for a year now but he&#39;s known me since before I came out as a guy and is 100% supportive and sees me as one. When we first started dating he hadn&#39;t labelled really himself and said he just likes me for me and thats all that mattered to him. He&#39;s always called me he/him and his boyfriend.</p> <p>But the situation is that he just told me he doesn&#39;t think he likes guys and that I&#39;d be the only exception to that. He told me that I have more feminine facial features and maybe thats why? He said that he thought about being with any other guy made him feel wrong. he also said that he doesn&#39;t know how me going on T would change how he feels about me. I really didn&#39;t know how to respond during the conversation, I was mostly just confused and hurt. Then,
