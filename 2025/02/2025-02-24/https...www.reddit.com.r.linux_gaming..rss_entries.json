I believe it should work on most distros.</p> <p>I made this because I personally had some issues installing some other mod managers, and I figured managing mods really just involves moving some files around and working with JSON and XML.

But no matter if I&#39;m running a benchmark like Blender&#39;s (~1800 result vs expected ~3200), or if I&#39;m in game in something like RDR2 (30-40FPS vs expected 60-70), performance is underwhelming. Wattage is fine, temps are good, usage is 100% under load (only ~70% in RDR2), clock speeds are expected. It just doesn&#39;t seem to want to work properly, no matter the programs or how it&#39;s used.</p> <p>When I was running standard Mint, this wasn&#39;t a problem. Only notice this in Debian/LMDE. Is this due to the outdated driver? Am I missing some other necessary software?</p> <p>I&#39;ve also manually installed libnvi",
