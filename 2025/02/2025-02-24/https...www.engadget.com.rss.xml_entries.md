But this Wednesday (February 26) at 10am ET, the company is holding a presentation in New York City.

<p>The footage shows plenty of cool stuff, including the return of <em>Rogue One’</em>s chief antagonist Orson Crennic and the beloved droid K-2SO. The Death Star makes an appearance, which isn’t surprising given the ending of the first season. Mon Mothma also attends an extravagant “let them eat cake” type of party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blendo Games&#39; latest installment of interactive weirdness, <em>Skin Deep</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is due to hit Steam on April 30, after nearly seven years of development.<em> Skin Deep</em> is a first-person sci-fi shooter, but it doesn&#39;t look (or smell?) like any of the dramatic space operas or realistic, precision-based games that generally flood this genre.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Skin Deep </em>takes place on a futuristic cargo starship managed by an insurance corporation and filled with its clients&#39; valuables, and you&#39;re the cryogenically frozen security officer kept on board in case something goes awry. Space pirates ambush the ship, your body thaws, and a non-linear game of shooting, sneaking, sabotaging and smelling ensues, all presented in Blendo&#39;s signature blocky 3D style.</p>

<p>You might be tempted to get a Chromebook as your next laptop and we wouldn’t blame you. Chrome OS has come a long way: Chromebooks today have a good combination of build quality, battery life and power while also supporting years of software updates that will take you years into the future. If you primarily browse the web, or don’t need a ton of extra software on a regular basis, a Chromebook can be a powerful daily driver.<br><br>While Google did make things simpler last fall by introducing the Chromebook Plus initiative (more on that below), there are still multiple things to keep in mind when shopping for a new Chromebook. The market is saturated with machines at different price points and power levels; I’ve been testing and reviewing Chromebooks for years and know what you should be looking for, and what you can expect out of these laptops.</p>

<p>Figuring out the best iPad for you can be tricky. Apple’s lineup now includes three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch ones, each with key differences in pricing, specs and accessory support. The iPad mini is still hanging around, too. If you’re looking to upgrade, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones will best fit certain needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for casual streaming and reading.</p>
