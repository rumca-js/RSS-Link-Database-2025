But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, <em>Aliens, </em>go for a more action-orien

<p>With the arrival of a new Superman movie later this year, the new DC Universe continues to grow on film and television. But what about the video games? According to DC Studios co-chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran, DCU games are still in development, but they're still years away from being released.</p><p>"We work incredibly closely with [Global Streaming and Games CEO] JB Perrette, who runs that division, and it's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Brothers," Safran said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-couple-years-before-we-see-the-first-dcu-video-game-james-gunn-says-but-first-fortnite">IGN</a>.

<p>The PEGI board has announced that it has reversed its decision to classify Balatro with a PEGI 18 rating and will instead have a PEGI 12 rating. The game has a E10+ rating in North America, making its original PEGI 18 classification in Europe strange.</p><p>As revealed in an update on the <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">PEGI website</a>, Balatro's European publisher, Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing, successfully appealed the PEGI 18 classification. While the board originally classified the game as PEGI 18 due to explaining various poker hands, the more fantastical elements mitigated the "gambling" aspects and brought the rating down to PEGI 12.</p><p>Another game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord/">Luck Be A Landlord</a>, also got its PEGI 18 rating reduced to PEGI 12.
