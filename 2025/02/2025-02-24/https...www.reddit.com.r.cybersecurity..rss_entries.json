Im currently living in Canada and i plan to enroll in cybersecurity which has a Co-op program. I also looked into med school since it has more opportunities and easier job security but honestly I just dont see myself dealing with people, I just think that cybersecurity is best fit for me as I have dealt with programming before. Here are my questions</p> <p>1: for the fellow Canadians out there, is Cybersecurity a good course/program to have so you can secure a job easy? Basically, is it in demand?</p> <p>2: Are you going to be unemployed just as people say because of tough competition? I hope you guys could convince me otherwise. I would really like to work in cybersecurity but I wouldn&#39;t want to graduate without work at all.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",
