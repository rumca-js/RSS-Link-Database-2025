Brimming with Celtic/British legends and folklore, loveable monsters, strong found family vibes, and lots of humour and heart, this is a deeply immersive and atmospheric fairytale-esque quest adventure with sharp teeth but a soft heart. Now, I don’t know what I was expecting from Greenteeth, but it really surprised me in all the best ways. I mean, just listen to this wicked premise: a lake monster, a witch, a hobgoblin, and their trusty four-footer embark on an heroic magical quest throughout the mystical lands of Britain, Wales, Scotland, and faerie realms to defeat an ancient evil that threatens not just their home, but the very soul of Britain.
