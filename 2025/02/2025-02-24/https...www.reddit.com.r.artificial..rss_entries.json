Let&#39;s say you just found the term Booktok, and you tell an AI that term makes you wants to jump. Obviously a human can tell that&#39;s a joke immediately. Suicide is often joked about in the form of &quot;blank makes me want to put a nonblank right to the noggin&quot;, but AI companies are under constant pressure of not injuring or being sued by users, so they cannot allow AI to talk about such things except in a literal sense, where the human operator is typing their question one handed hanging from a crane over a pit of lava. It&#39;s embarrassing. Let your AI have some fun</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DeathCobro\"> /u/DeathCobro </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iwtc60/ai_will_need_to_pass_this_barrier/\">[link]</a></s",
