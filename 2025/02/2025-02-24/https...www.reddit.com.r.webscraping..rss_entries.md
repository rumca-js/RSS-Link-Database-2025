<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The main issue is that the XPath for popups (specifically the &quot;Not now&quot; buttons) keeps changing every time the page reloads. I initially targeted the button using the <code>aria-label</code> attribute, but even that doesn&#39;t always work because the XPath or the structure of the button dynamically changes</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/teabagpb"> /u/teabagpb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixd0ac/selenium_issue_dynamic_popups_with_changing_xpath/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixd0ac/selenium_issue_dynamic_popups_with_changing_xpath/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pretty much the title, I’m just trying to see if there are cases where someone has build a product using scraped data, one example I could find is an web app with house listings collected from 30 different agencies. Which seems to be a win win for everyone given that when a user decided which house they like the link takes them back to the original listing. I’ve thinking to do something similar and was wondering if anyone else had made a product that way. Thanks :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Emergency-Agreeable"> /u/Emergency-Agreeable </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixcjhd/has_any_build_a_product_using_scraped_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixcjhd/has_any_build_a_product_using_scraped_data/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to take cookies created in NoDriver and reuse them in Requests to make subsequent calls. However, this results in a 403 so I&#39;m assuming bot protection is flagging the request. I&#39;m also mimicking the headers in an identical manner. </p> <p>Does anyone have any experience making this work? I feel like I might be missing something simple </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/barrycarey"> /u/barrycarey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixbs4x/cloudflare_bot_management_cookie_from_nodriver/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixbs4x/cloudflare_bot_management_cookie_from_nodriver/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was getting overwhelmed with so many APIs, tools and libraries out there. Then, I stumbled upon anti-detect browsers. Most of them let you create your own RPAs. You can also run them on a schedule with rotating proxies. Sometimes you&#39;ll need add a bit of Javascript code to make it work, but overall I think this is a great place to start learning how to use xpath and so on.</p> <p>You can also test your xpath in chrome dev tool console by using javascript. E.g. $x(&quot;//div//span[contains(@name, &#39;product-name&#39;)]&quot;)</p> <p>Once you have your RPA fully functioning and tested export it and throw it into some AI coding platform to help you turn it into python, node.js or whatever.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/polarmass"> /u/polarmass </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iwylko/scraping_advice_for_beginners/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr
