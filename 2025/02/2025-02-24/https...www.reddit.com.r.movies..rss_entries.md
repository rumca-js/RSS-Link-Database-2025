## I rewatched Children of Men last night. The ceasefire scene is so intense and emotional. I can't think of comparable scenes in other movies. Would love to hear some suggestions.

## "Unforgiven" (1992) - What is your assessment on Sheriff Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman): a guy trying his best to keep the peace or a sadist who took delight in torture?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was pleased when Gene Hackman won the Academy Award because Bill Daggett isn&#39;t a easy character because of his complexity as an amoral character, he&#39;s someone who&#39;s trying to end the problem by not bringing justice against the men who scarred a local prostitute, because he&#39;s afraid of the impact it will degenerate, yet the more he insists on going after the vigilantes the prostitutes pay for, the more cruel and psychotic he becomes, getting to the point you just realize he&#39;s a bad guy. </p> <p>Yes, you do see Bill is problematic early on, when he shuts down Alice (Frances Fisher), and he gets worse and worse. The glee he gets from torturing English Bob (Richard Harris) and Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is where you truly see the monster he is. </p> <p>It&#39;s also curious how Will Munny (Clint Eastwood) is the former murderer who is reformed and is currently a widowed family man who has enough empathy to comfort Delilah (Anna Thom

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So somehow, we&#39;re now in the far flung future of 2025. Back when I was a kid, an &quot;old movie&quot; typically meant a black and white movie from the 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s, etc. Even 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s movies seemed &quot;old&quot; back then when we were in the 90&#39;s.</p> <p>However, we&#39;re now....somehow, in the far flung future of 2025. That means 80&#39;s movies are now over 40 years old and 90&#39;s movies are over 30 years old. For a teen growing up today, a movie that came out in 2005 like Batman Begins would be considered &quot;the old Batman movie.&quot;</p> <p>So what do you consider an old movie these days?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/precita"> /u/precita </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ixb3il/what_do_you_consider_an_old_movie_nowadays/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ix

Despite some social media activity from Vin Diesel back in August 2024 that indicated filming had begun, complete with a couple of set photos, there seems to be remarkably little information out there about this one.</p> <p>There’s very minimal crew information available out there across any area of the production, no cast has been announced beyond Diesel, and the general vibe I get is that it’s either a very, very small independent production or that some sort of finance issue delayed the project after a short period of time.</p> <p>I’d be curious to know if anyone has any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PreparationNorth2426"> /u/PreparationNorth2426 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ix4y0u/riddick_furya_whats_the_status/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r

## Watched Threads (1984) last night.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I typically enjoy watching uncomfortable movies, but Threads was on another level. This was one of the few times I found myself just waiting for it to end—not because it was bad, but because it was that bleak and overwhelming. The sheer hopelessness, the raw depiction of nuclear devastation, and the complete collapse of society make it one of the most unsettling films I’ve ever seen.</p> <p>And yet… I loved it. It’s rare for a movie to hit that hard and leave me feeling awful for days afterward, but Threads absolutely nailed it. It’s easily one of the most effective and terrifying pieces of media I’ve ever sat through.</p> <p>Anyway, going to watch some uplifting movies this week, I need something positive to cleanse my palate. Feel free to suggest something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dulldyldyl"> /u/dulldyldyl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ix4uro/watch

The way they’ve introduced us to all of these characters, is very compelling to me. </p> <p>I liked how they opened the movies and then jumped forward five years, and then told us through other ways that they were indeed in the same settlement as the surveyors at the start of the movie. </p> <p>I loved the caravan that was being led Luke Wilson’s character, and dynamics that were covered there. </p> <p>I loved Kevin Costners character, the little we find out about him.
