I remember loving the world, the political intrigue, the magic, and most of the books, but I ended up hate finishing them because they were so damn bleak. And then of course it ended in misery and I felt vindicated by my hate but glad I had at least tied up the loose ends. I recently started looking for a new fantasy series to get into and I keep seeing that trilogy recommended everywhere, so I thought I&#39;d give another of her series a shot and started Ship of Magic. I&#39;m quickly finding that I feel the exact same way as the first trilogy, the world is really interesting, the magic is interesting, I can see where these plot lines are gonna cross and I&#39;m looking forward to that, but I hate all these characters. Everyone sucks, and everything sucks for them. Does it ever get better or is that just how she writes? There&#39;s only one likeable character to me, Althea, and so of c",

So on one hand, it\u2019s a nice reprieve from my typically neurotic self. On the other, it\u2019s excessive as fuck and bordering an actual addiction. Does anyone else have this problem?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>2025 is the year of expanding my fantasy taste, so I read Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett, and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, and I did not find either of them remotely funny or interesting. I am very sad about this because I typically like consuming lighthearted/funny media and I was excited to start Discworld this year. So I need help, I\u2019m asking for book recommendations based on the fact that the humor in those books did not work for me but that I still may find funny and enjoy them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DrTropicalle\"> /u/DrTropicalle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ixa79h/i_am_sad_to_realize_that_i_may_have_no_literary/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ixa79h/i_am_sad_to_realize_that_i_may_have_no_literary/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This type of comedic roles is often given to male characters.</p> <p>But then I also think about Hellian in Malazan. Among hundreds of characters, from gods to warlords, how come has she left such a strong impression on me? At a first glance, she is just an alcoholic sergeant. There is however something so compelling about her. How she offers a unique insight into war, or how her tragedy is built within her comedy (Spoiler The Crippled God)<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">She ate a spider when she was a kid, and her parents had to make her eat ice, and since then she is terrified of spiders, and to cope with this fear, she became an alcoholic...

My plunge into fantasy has taken me through all the Dark Tower books and AGOT, with a few excursions for The Old Man and The Sea and Tom Sawyer and The Fisherman by John Langan.</p> <p>Some great things: - Prose. I prefer JA\u2019s prose to GRRM and Stephen King\u2019s, the last two authors I\u2019ve read. Probably the most impressive thing about this story is how the actual word composition changes between POVs. An excerpt of Logen\u2019s POV is what hooked me. Most sentences are fragments, like: - \u201cHe felt a shadow fall across his face. Another Flathead. A damn big one. Already in the air, arms outstretched. No time to get the axe.\u201d - It\u2019s enough to give an English teacher a brain aneurysm. But who cares about grammar if it reads well? Writers want to entertain, not help 16 year olds cram for the ACT. Other POVs with different prose styles include (1) Glokta, whose chapters are 50% snappy, cynical intern",

I was quiet surprised when his new trilogy had a sequal book that shows that it&#39;s tied into that original series.</p> <p>That said, I do wish Feist&#39;s publisher would get David Thorpe to redo the entirety of the original series. I&#39;ve got Thrope&#39;s narration of the Midkemia trilogy, and I love it! It&#39;d be great to hear him do the rest of the series - especially since he did the Firemane trilogy and appears to be doing the dragonwars saga.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/orcus2190\"> /u/orcus2190 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iwqe4n/raymond_e_feists_magician_series/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iwqe4n/raymond_e_feists_magician_series/\">[comments]</a></span>",
