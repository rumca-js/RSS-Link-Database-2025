It's always great to see a long-running series like Dynasty Warriors experimenting with new genres because it often leads to innovation, and Abyss does succeed overall with adapting the ideas of a massive roster of characters and over-the-top Mousu action. However, not enough of the other elements of a genuinely excellent action roguelite line up here to make it the kind I return to for months.",

But in that quest to make Monster Hunter more approachable, Wilds has carved a little too close to the bone in some places, trimming its challenge back so much that I barely needed to dig into its in-depth equipment system at all this time to become an apex predator. Its more flexible combat is some of the most fun I\u2019ve had with the series, but like the blustering lighting storms of its gorgeous desert, it'll burns brightly but briefly until Capcom unleashes some real endgame beasts to challenge us.\n\n#MonsterHunterWilds #Gaming #IGN",
