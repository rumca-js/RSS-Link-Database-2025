Thanks to endless scrolling on TikTok and relying on AI tools for basic tasks, I feel like I\u2019ve lost a sense of literacy. It\u2019s like my ability to read, write, and even think critically has taken a hit.</p> <p>I want to get back into reading, but here\u2019s the catch: I\u2019ve always had a short attention span, and sticking with books has been a struggle for me. I\u2019ll start something and either lose interest or get distracted.</p> <p>Has anyone else felt this way? How did you work through it? And if you\u2019ve got book recommendations for someone trying to ease back into reading, I\u2019d love to hear them! Something engaging but not overwhelming would be perfect.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your advice! \ud83d\ude0a</p> <p>For context, I\u2019m open to any genre\u2014fiction or nonfiction\u2014but shorter books or ones with gripping stories would probably help me stay focuse",

They\u2019re the best stories and characters ever, but the problem is, I\u2019m having trouble moving on to other decent books now. After finishing HP I read the Lincoln Lawyer books, The Midnight Library (recommended by ChatGPT lol), and Among the Bros (recommended by my mom). Out of those, The Lincoln Lawyer books have been decent, but nowhere near as gripping and exciting as HP. </p> <p>Did anybody go through this similar experience? I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s a book genre that I\u2019m missing out on entirely that is like Harry Potter.

In my childhood, my favorite book series was <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>. I also loved adventure novels, such as <em>White Fang</em> by Jack London. As I grew older, my tastes evolved, balancing between adventure stories and works by authors like Camus, Hesse, and Sartre. I explored classic Russian literature and major American classics as well. However, over time, I started reading less and less. In the past few years, I\u2019ve only finished a few novels, mostly preferring non-fiction books about my profession, neuroscience, and psychology.</p> <p>Recently, I\u2019ve become fascinated with the outdoors, travel, scientific discoveries, and exploration. I want to find books that are easy to read and engaging, given my past reading experience, while also aligning with my interests in nature and adventure. It\u2019s important for me to",

I\u2019ve read a lot of the popular, trending ones- It Ends With Us, Verity, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, The Silent Patient, and others you\u2019d typically find on the shelf at Target.

Severance is one of my favorite shows, and The Truman Show really stuck with me because of its eerie, manipulated reality.
