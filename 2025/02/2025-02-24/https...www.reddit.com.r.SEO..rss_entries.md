I&#39;ve been doing SEO and front-end web dev for about a year for a small roofing company in Texas. Most of my job I&#39;ve been learning as I go, which my boss knew and supported. </p> <p>I essentially replaced a third-party company that was doing a bad job. Every page of our site had the same title and meta description, all using stock photos. Blog posts were clearly AI written, stuffed with keywords, and posted at unpredictable times (like 4 in one day then none for 5 weeks). Through them we had a lot of backlinks but they were all sketchy directory websites. The first chunk of my work was just cleaning up their mess, getting us off of scammy sites, and making sure our home page didn&#39;t describe spa services (true story).</p> <p>So now we need backlinks. I have reached out to organizations we are a part of,
