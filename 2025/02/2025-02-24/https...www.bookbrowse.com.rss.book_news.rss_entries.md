Two pieces of state legislation recently introduced in Iowa challenge the state's obscenity code related to libraries and schools and threaten libraries with civil action related to allegedly obscene materials. House File 274 would repeal a section of the Iowa Code that addresses obscenity exemptions for public libraries and educational institutions, while Senate File 347 aims to control the selection and purchase of books and materials with alleged sexual content and proposes steep fines for sharing such work with minors.
