Unfortunately, fullscreen gameplay still bleeds to the second monitor, while the steam app itself doesn&#39;t bleed even in fullscreen. With this parameter, opening games (tried with NineSols and Hollow Knight) took approximately 2 minutes as well, which is extremely unusual compared to the same settings running on my old 22.04 (same machine). Aside from the bleeding and much delay in opening the game, the game ran just fine afterwards.<br/> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/

This is fine, but tedious for opening many files. I want to be able to right-click on a file and say &quot;open with lutris&quot; - or similar - and it just opening. </p> <p>Has anyone ever had that problem and maybe solved it?

It is a command-line-only simple mod manager for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. It is written in Ruby, which is the only dependency. I believe it should work on most distros.</p> <p>I made this because I personally had some issues installing some other mod managers, and I figured managing mods really just involves moving some files around and working with JSON and XML.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a long, long journey of bugfixing to get here, and at this point, I&#39;m running LMDE6 and Liquorix with proprietary 535 drivers. My current problem seems to be that I can&#39;t get my 4060 laptop GPU working to it&#39;s full performance, no matter what.</p> <p>According to nvtop, everything is (mostly) hunky-dory. But no matter if I&#39;m running a benchmark like Blender&#39;s (~1800 result vs expected ~3200), or if I&#39;m in game in something like RDR2 (30-40FPS vs expected 60-70), performance is underwhelming. Wattage is fine, temps are good, usage is 100% under load (only ~70% in RDR2), clock speeds are expected. It just doesn&#39;t seem to want to work properly, no matter the programs or how it&#39;s used.</p> <p>When I was running standard Mint, this wasn&#39;t a problem. Only notice this in Debian/LMDE. Is this due to the outdated driver? Am I missing some other necessary software?</p> <p>I&#39;ve also manually installed libnvi
