If anyone knows a software like this that would work, I&#39;d greatly appreciate the information! Also, I need a software that can run on a virtual machine, as we don&#39;t have the space to allow for new hardware. Thank you so much ",

Instead if you know what you are doing, ask the AI about your situation and what you want to do, with further research and proper knowledge this is the most effective way to find what you need. Forget the forum post from 2009, forget the guides and forum posts where it\u2019s generic or even worse, not for your system.
