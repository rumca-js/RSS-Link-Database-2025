<p>Developers spend more time on operational and background tasks than they do on coding, according to an <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US53204725">IDC analyst report</a> published this month.</p>



<p>Application development accounted for 16% of developers’ time in 2024, up from 15% the year before, while the majority of developers’ time was spent on operational and supportive tasks, according to the report, titled “How Do Software Developers Spend Their Time?,” authored  by Adam Resnick, IDC research manager for modern software. </p>



<p>Developers spent the largest amounts of time on operational tasks including implementing CI/CD processes and methodologies, application

<p>Database engine developer  <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2267076/what-is-mongodb-a-quick-guide-for-developers.html">MongoDB</a> has acquired Voyage AI in order to help enterprises reduce hallucinations in AI-powered applications.</p>



<p>“With this acquisition, MongoDB will help deliver AI-powered, never-before-seen high quality outputs (via high quality data retrieval) as a fully formed database solution — not with tacked on additions,” the database developer firm said in a statement.</p>



<p>Voyage AI develops embedding and reranking models used in retrieval-augmented generation RAG. These models will help reduce hallucinations by enhancing vector search with new embeddings t

<p>With the pace of innovation in AI accelerating, it’s important for developers to get early access to new tools and technologies. To that end, Microsoft has introduced a module inside its <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3608598/microsoft-rebrands-azure-ai-studio-to-azure-ai-foundry.html">Azure AI Foundry</a> service that aims to bring the latest innovations and research in AI to developers.</p>



<p>“We’ve witnessed a shift from unveiling a new model every 4–6 months to releasing breakthroughs every 4–6 days,” the company wrote in a blog post, adding that the rebranded module could act as a bridge between research and application building.</p>

<p>Machine learning technology is taking hold across many sectors as its applications are more widely adopted. The research firm Fortune Business Insights forecasts the global machine-learning market will expand from $26.03 billion in 2023 to $225.91 billion by 2030. Use cases for machine learning include product recommendations, image recognition, fraud detection, language translation, diagnostic tools, and more.</p>



<p>A subset of artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2254843/what-is-machine-learning-intelligence-derived-from-data.html">machine learning</a> refers to the process of training algorithms to make predictive decisions using large sets of data. The pot

<p>Artificial intelligence, which was thought to be handily dominated by American labs and researchers, was <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3814855/the-deepseek-lesson.html">thrown for a loop</a> with DeepSeek’s R1. And yet, R1 is still subject to many of the same pitfalls as other models—we must make radical advances to move beyond the current limitations of AI. Though exact costs associated with the model are subject to controversy, R1’s release made it clear that there is substantial room for innovation outside of large incumbents.</p>



<p>As that occurs, AI models are beginning to hit the limits of compute. Model size is far outpacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's

<p>We’re living in a strange time for software development. On the one hand, AI-driven coding assistants have shaken up a hitherto calcified IDE market. As <a href="https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2025/02/21/ai-disruption-code-editors-are-up-for-grabs/">RedMonk Cofounder James Governor puts it</a>, “suddenly we’re in a position where there is a surprising amount of turbulence in the market for editors,” when “everything is in play” with “so much innovation happening.” Ironically, that very innovation in genAI may be stifling innovation in the software those coding assistants increasingly recommend.
