Warriors: Abyss reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC

Warriors: Abyss may stumble in its open-ended, cookie-cutter story and cut-and-paste boss battles, but the replayability that comes from its combat and the customization of its multitude of characters and builds helped keep me slashing through thousands of enemies for dozens of hours of roguelite runs. It's always great to see a long-running series like Dynasty Warriors experimenting with new genres because it often leads to innovation, and Abyss does succeed overall with adapting the ideas of a massive roster of characters and over-the-top Mousu action. However, not enough of the other elements of a genuinely excellent action roguelite line up here to make it the kind I return to for months.

Monster Hunter Wilds reviewed by Tom Marks on PlayStation 5 Pro, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the traditionally rough edges of the series in smart ways, reducing as much friction as possible that could get in the way of you grabbing any of its exceptionally fun weapons and planting them firmly in a monster’s hide. But in that quest to make Monster Hunter more approachable, Wilds has carved a little too close to the bone in some places, trimming its challenge back so much that I barely needed to dig into its in-depth equipment system at all this time to become an apex predator. Its more flexible combat is some of the most fun I’ve had with the series, but like the blustering lighting storms of its gorgeous desert, it'll burns brightly but briefly until Capcom unleashes some real endgame beasts to challenge us.
