Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

We're back with Chris from Lords of War to talk about our the last 25 years of experience with the much maligned, often lampooned and occasionally beloved Games Workshop (now Warhammer) Retail Chain. Let's dive in.
