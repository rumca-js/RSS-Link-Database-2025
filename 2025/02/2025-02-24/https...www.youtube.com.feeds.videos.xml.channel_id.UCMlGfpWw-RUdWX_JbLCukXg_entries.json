We cover bindings, including a manual approach, and compare them with generated bindings using CXX.  We also show how to link CMake with Cargo and link with transitive C++ dependencies using Conan.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Cpp_Rust_Interop.pdf\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nTyler Weaver\n \nTyler Weaver has been writing C++ for 10 short years in multiple domains. He's worked on signal processing, robotics, and now back-end web development at SciTec.\n---\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering for the entire C++ community. The conference is organized by the C++ community for the community. You will enjoy inspirational talks and a friendly atmosphere designed to help attendees learn from each other, ",
