It is totally ATS Friendly.</p> <p>Many of my friends loved it and asked me to make it public. So, I did! No money, no sign-ups\u2014just a free tool for everyone.</p> <p>Check it out only if you think it\u2019s worth it!

The UI looked like something from 2010, and not in a cool retro way. Had to trash the whole thing and restart, which sucked but was definitely the right call.</p> <p>Not gonna lie, hitting that &quot;publish&quot; button was terrifying. My finger hovered over it for a good 5 minutes while I panicked about all the bugs I probably missed.<",

So I thought what if at the end of my day , I couls visualise my browser activity.</p> <p>Simply put , the app or extension, would map my activities during that day, in the browser, to a graph-ish representation, maybe consisting of nodes or directed arrows. More like how you create mind mappings. This could further be extended to map these tasks to the daily goals you&#39;ve set.

Our goal is to make it easy for developers to integrate agent functionality into any application. Early on, we realized that there is a lot of buzz around agents but it comes with a steep learning curve to actually building one. Moreover, making an agent that you can deploy and work with comes with a whole lot of infra challenges. To solve this, we&#39;re making it super easy by giving you a fully managed platform, along with pre-built agents and integrations allowing you to focus on innovating instead of setting up infra. </p> <p>If you&#39;re a developer, we also have an SDK and some examples to show how easy it is to build with us.<br/> SDK - <a href=\"https://github.com/truffle-ai/truffle-ai-sdk\">https://github.com/truffle-ai/truffle-ai-sdk</a><br/> Examples - <a href=\"https://github.com/truffle-ai/",
