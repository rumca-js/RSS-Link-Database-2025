Today on the Matt Walsh Show, it sounds like a Babylon Bee headline but it’s true: woke criminal justice reform has gotten to the point where now an axe murderer cannibal is being released back into society. But don’t worry: he promises he won’t butcher and consume anyone else. Also, Ilhan Omar comes right out and says exactly how she feels about Americans. We are stupid and shouldn’t be allowed to say “ridiculous things.” Those are her words exactly. A trans actor is shocked to find out that his passport correctly lists his sex. Tragedy strikes the nation as Joy Reid is fired from her MSNBC show. I am truly mourning the loss. I’ll explain why.
