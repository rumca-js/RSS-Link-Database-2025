I enjoy reading adventure fiction(Jules Verne Stevenson, etc) but i feel like I am missing out on the modern examples of this genre. If you read and loved a (completed) historical/fantasy adventure(no sci-fi tho) series, I would appropriate the recommendations. I don\u2019t mind romance, if it doesn\u2019t replace the plot, love strong heroines and banter, pirates, travels, ancient cultures, etc.</p> <p>Thank you \ud83d\ude4f </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Real_Bowler8116\"> /u/Real_Bowler8116 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ihh2t8/looking_for_book_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ihh2t8/looking_for_book_recommendations/\">[comments]</a></span>",
