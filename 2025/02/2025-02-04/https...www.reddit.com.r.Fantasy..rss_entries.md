<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all - I&#39;m trying to do research for a novel writing project and would love some book suggestions! I&#39;m working on a project with ancient mythological elements translated and evolved into the modern world/one modern city, but the story idea doesn&#39;t work if the setting is a complete fantasy world, and real cities that still stand have too much of their own identities for me to project this new layer of myth onto. </p> <p>Anyone have any recs for contemporary/urban fantasies that take place in the real world but a fictitious city? Or any book where the author carves out a pocket of the real world and adds a new made-up place that feels plausible?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I picked up Immortal at a bookstore and realized after I got home that its part of a larger universe. I know it says on the insert that it is a standalone book within the CK universe, but I went ahead and picked up the Daughter of the Moon Goddess. Since I was looking forward to starting Immortal after finishing my last read, I was wondering if there is a suggested reading order or if reading the Daughter of the Moon Goddess first would increase any insights or add to Immortal, or if its quite minimal. I know there&#39;s a second book as well so I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions or recommendations about the reading order, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Popular_Adagio_3355"> /u/Popular_Adagio_3355 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ihue6f/celestial_kingdom_reading_order/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comm

I wonder if it&#39;s the book, just me, or maybe a common thing in this genre?</p> <p>Mild spoilers ahead but no major plot points</p> <p>I never got a proper sense of the technological level of the world that felt cohesive. The small village is behind the rest of the world and mostly act as though they&#39;re in a pre-tech era, but they have TV, rice cookers, and potentially even smartphones. Bullets and bombs for sure exist but their interaction with the various powers and why they seem to be used at random in battle wasn&#39;t explained at all. Why is everyone fighting with swords and powers if guns exist? Maybe they aren&#39;t effective

He was doing a read-along, and I decided to join in. What I didn’t expect was how deeply those books would affect me. The melancholy nature of the story became a vessel for my grief, allowing me to release emotions I had been holding in. I cried—a lot. In a way, those books helped me let go of the sadness I had been carrying.</p> <p>For me, true closure came at the end of Fool’s Fate, and with it, my own grief found resolution.

It has an <em>incredibly</em> rough beginning, for me, but ultimately was enjoyable and satisfying.</p> <p>As for the beginning: the first few pages had at one point had 3 self-interjections from our first person narrator on one page (things like &quot;Goddamnit, I needed to focus&quot;) interrupting the narrative, as well as numerous flashback paragraphs. This was presumably to try and build a sense of the character&#39;s person and history immediately, but it was <em>so</em> blunt and overt. There was also the choice to make the main character cartoonishly averse to mushrooms, in a city of mushroom people and fungal-built structures and food. Not only is she racist against the native fungi people (she has <em>six</em> different slurs she uses for them), she also has mycophobia in general for anything related to fungi.</p> <p>All of these flaws, along with her past traumaa,

There was a transparent page on top of the cover that hid the hellish underside with bedrock until you flipped it open. It was supposed to represent the main character’s ignorance of said environment until they literally stumble upon it. There was also some debris floating around the plateau in rings, I believe.

## Greatest magnificent bastards in fantasy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m more than halfway through The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie and I absolutely love it. I have an attraction to some works where some or all of the main characters are such giant bastards but you can&#39;t help but be fascinated by them. Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, lots of gangster movies, you name it. So I&#39;m curious if there are any more characters like this that you can think of in fantasy? Some examples I can think of off the top of my head are Jorg and Jalan from Mark Lawrence&#39;s Broken Empire books and of course Lies of Locke Lamora, but I was wondering if there are any others y&#39;all can think of.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mr_splodee"> /u/mr_splodee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ih9h34/greatest_magnificent_bastards_in_fantasy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ih9h34/greate

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’m in the veryy early stages of writing my own book, and I am a big believer that to make something new, you gotta understand the old/the standard, so I hoping for some recs to help with my research. </p> <p>My story for context features a heavily isolated military society (almost spartan) with a hard magic system certain bloodlines can access. Necromancy adjacent magic being the most impactful on the world and society (both good and bad ways). </p> <p>Theme wise it is very critical of the military industrial complex, coming to realize one’s own prejudices, and bringing balance back to nature. </p> <p>For context, books I have on my tbr list include the Poppy Wars, rereading Ember in the Ashes, And I Darken, and The Locked Tome (it’s been a Hot minute), but I would like some more adult books, especially if they are a shorter series.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no stranger to the fantasy genre and have an epic under my belt (RotE), so it wouldn&#39;t be a unique undertaking. However, I have a lot of books that I want to read in a genre where they tend to be exceptionally long. So before I dive in, I have to ask if I would even like the books.</p> <p>Some things I love about the show are the charcaters and their back stories, the massive feeling of the world itself, and Moiraine (lol)</p> <p>Some things I love in fantasy in general are characters I can relate to, slice of life (just love enjoying a character doing &quot;normal&quot; things in their unique fantasy world), and intricate plots. Slow moving is fine by me.</p> <p>The thing I&#39;ve heard about the books that gives me pause is that the women aren&#39;t written very well. I don&#39;t really like when characters aren&#39;t well developed/don&#39;t have unique motivations and personalities as I read mostly for characters and less for plot</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Jeff Strand does it again! Funny, action packed. The country is overrun by mindless vampire like creatures, and now more intelligent hybrid ones that can strategize. A young man and his mother live in a county which has so far escaped the notice of scourge that has overrun every city and town. Until they take in an injured stranger. Like all Strand’s work, the dialog is hilarious, and the action is frenetic when the novel isn’t being funny. Full disclosure, I’m not quite done (on a Ritalin break), but couldn’t wait to share my review and introduce y’all to the fun. So far the book hasn’t gone dark like many of Strand’s do at one point or another. Although I’m not completely finished, I’m still expecting it to be one of the lighter Strand novels; much like my favorite of his, <strong>Clowns vs Spiders</strong>. Enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThreadWyrm"> /u/ThreadWyrm </a> <br/> <span><a h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m currently reading the second part of the book (Magician: Master), and the change in pacing between part one and two has just about given me whiplash… 😅</p> <p>The first book was kind of slow in the same vein as a lot of LOTR inspired stories, a slow trek following Pug (it takes like 200 pages for them to even leave the castle I think)</p> <p>But then book two just has all these insane time jumps. (A year here, FIVE years there…) And there is virtually no more slog. Every chapter has huge, important events, and it’s insane.</p> <p>I think I read in the author’s forward that he believed he broke a lot of conventional “rules” in writing this (his first book” and I have to agree. It just isn’t formatted like a typical novel would be, and honestly I think that both helps and hurts it. 🤷‍♂️ Anyway, I’m loving this book and am eager to continue!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kooky_County9569"> /u/
