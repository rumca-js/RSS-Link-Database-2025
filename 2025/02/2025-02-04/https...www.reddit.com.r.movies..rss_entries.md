<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>murder investigation thriller movies which happens in a group inside a house. Doesn&#39;t have to be detective movie just finding who did the crime doesnt even have to be murder as well.</p> <p>When murder/ crime happens in close quarters like a house or mansion or boat train blah blah blah, the people in the group would know that nobody would trust each other out of fear and cause them to act alone which becomes ideal situation for murderer especially when nobody notices the pattern and more people get killed.</p> <p>Edit : I will come back after few days and then list them here in numbering type format.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, last night I made a joke to my brother that I was gonna get high and watch some foreign lesbian love story. Then I did precisely that - 3 grams of edibles later and I rented &quot;Portrait of a lady on Fire&quot;</p> <p>The movie had good reviews, and I&#39;m still treating it like a joke at first. It&#39;s about 5-10 minutes into the film I realized every assumption I MAY have had about the movie was far, far off. and any notions of it being like a joke turned into a joke themselves.</p> <p>The shots of the movie were <strong>so utterly beautiful it sometimes felt like I didn&#39;t even have the right to look at the screen.</strong> The <strong>characters were so utterly realistic it sometimes felt like I was genuinely invading their privacy simply by watching them.</strong> I related to them. I liked them. It is the only film I have seen where <strong>the cinematography was so good it provided a theater-like experience at home.</strong></p> <p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I LOVE Stanley Tucci. I think he is a very talented actor, able to perform well in a variety of roles. I love watching my childhood favorite movies with my son and we are watching Beethoven. I was quite surprised to see Stanley Tucci in this as the “bad guy” in a silly movie. Haha</p> <p>What is your favorite role played by Stanley Tucci? I really liked him in The Hunger Games and as much as I hate the character, he did an excellent job at being someone we hate in The Lovely Bones. </p> <p>Edited to correct a word. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Personal_Orchid3675"> /u/Personal_Orchid3675 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ihjw82/stanley_tucci/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ihjw82/stanley_tucci/">[comments]</a></span>

## Why are newer movies just getting progressively louder and harder to hear the dialogue?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just recently got a 4k player and I&#39;ve been watching through a bunch of movies all through different time periods. Something I&#39;ve noticed is the dialogue is getting quieter and quiter compared to the rest of the mix. I have a good surround sound system and calibrated using Audyssey. Older films audio is clear at every volume. Newer films I have to listen to them earth shatteringly loud to hear the audio. Even turning my center channel way up. Dialogue is hard to hear.</p> <p>New alien, twisters, new avengers movies. Have to crank them so loud. And the worst one ever was tenet. I was geeked to watch this because I like TDK so much but holy hell. I literally have to knock the pictures off my neighbors walls to hear half the dialogue. It actually killed the movie for me. Felt like I had no idea what was going on because I missed half the dialogue.</p> <p>Feels like we&#39;re approaching a point where the movies will just be explosions that cause

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of my favorite things is rewatching movies i love and catching something new, especially if I&#39;ve rewatched it several times.</p> <p>For example, in Scream (spoilers for a nearly 30 year old movie) after Ghostface kills Tatum, Billy shows up to the party and gives Stu this look that is basically confirming to him that he killed Tatum without his saying anything. I never noticed it before, or if I did, I just took it as a friendly nod to his buddy but after rewatching it several times it stood out to me in a different light for some reason and I think it&#39;s brilliant </p> <p>What are examples of this happening to you with movies you love to rewatch? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TwentyNineNeiboltSt"> /u/TwentyNineNeiboltSt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ihiwds/what_is_something_interesting_you_did_not_notice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=
