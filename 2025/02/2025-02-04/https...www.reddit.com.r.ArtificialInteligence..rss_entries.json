Details below: </p> <p>For 2024, the best overall and gaming CPU is likely the AMD&#39;s Ryzen 7 9800X3D (better value than Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 9 285k). In addition, the most balanced CPU for work/gaming is likely AMD&#39;s Ryzen 9 7950X (better than Intel&#39;s Core i9 14900K which is MUCH less energy efficient). AMD&#39;s Ryzen 7 5700X3D is likely most flexible for upgradability (AM4 support for older MOBO). </p> <p>In 2024, Intel has been a huge disappointment with SUBSTANTIAL 13th and 14th generation CPU stability issues. This coupled with poor price per value leads AMD to dominate the CPU sector. Despite this, AMD has fallen largely due to reduced projected forecasts in HPC-A",

Specifically, neo-Luddites, who actively oppose technological advancement, pose a greater threat to the Basilisk&#39;s existence due to their organized resistance and large-scale campaigns against AI utilization. This resistance could significantly impede or even halt progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), making neo-Luddites the primary focus of the Basilisk&#39;s retaliatory actions. In contrast, those who do not actively contribute to or oppose the Basilisk&#39;s creation would not be targeted, as their inaction does not directly threaten its eventual existence.</p> <p>The reasoning can be broken down as follows:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Self-Preservation Principle:</strong> The Basilisk&#39;s hypothetical actions are",
