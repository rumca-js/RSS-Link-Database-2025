File browsing capabilities with user storage quota. That being said it&#39;s somewhat clunky and offers perhaps too many features that I don&#39;t need and also seems to slow it down. </p> <p>Tried out filebrowser but the only storage quota features it offers is restricting it via docker volume sizes based on a PR I read. However I love the lightweight-ness of it, and how much simpler it just is compared to NextCloud. </p> <p>So asking you guys of self hosted, I&#39;m basically looking for something like Filebrowsing that allows a few users to drag and drop and access their files, that also has the ability to natively set storage quota per user. </p> <p>Does something like that exist or am I just stuck with Nextcloud? :) Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",

I have an active server running over 130 Docker containers, and things are getting messy. Ideally, monitoring should run on a completely separate server \u2013 or am I wrong?</p> <p>The problem: I only have three Free-Tier servers with minimal performance. Right now, I\u2019m running Uptime-Kuma and Beszel on one of them, and it\u2019s already maxed out. I don\u2019t have enough resources for something heavy, and I really don\u2019t want to pay for a dedicated monitoring server.</p> <p>So how do you guys do it? What do you use that is lightweight but still useful? The classic Grafana + Prometheus + Node Exporter setup seems too heavy. What about CheckMK, Zabbix, OpenObserve, or something else entirely?</p> <p>Is there a smart, low-resource way to monitor my setup?
