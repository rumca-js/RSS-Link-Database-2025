<p>Apple, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/hot_tob_hardcore_porno_app_eu">in its media statement re: Hot Tub</a> (the you-have-to-admit-it’s-a-fun-name hardcore porn app now available in the AltStore PAL alternative app marketplace in the EU), closed its statement with the following: “The truth is that we are required by the European Commission to allow it to be distributed by marketplace operators like AltStore and Epic who may not share our concerns for user safety.”</p>

<p>On X, Epic CEO <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1886533813444207012">Tim Sweeney wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to Apple’s false statement, the Epic Games Store doesn’t
carry this app, doesn’t carry any porn apps, and has never carried
porn apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epic Games does run <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/mobile/ios">an alternative app marketplace for iOS in the EU</a>, and Sweeney is correct that neither Hot Tub, nor any other porno apps, are in it. B
