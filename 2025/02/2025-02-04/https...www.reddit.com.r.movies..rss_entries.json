Something I&#39;ve noticed is the dialogue is getting quieter and quiter compared to the rest of the mix. I have a good surround sound system and calibrated using Audyssey. Older films audio is clear at every volume. Newer films I have to listen to them earth shatteringly loud to hear the audio. Even turning my center channel way up. Dialogue is hard to hear.</p> <p>New alien, twisters, new avengers movies. Have to crank them so loud. And the worst one ever was tenet. I was geeked to watch this because I like TDK so much but holy hell. I literally have to knock the pictures off my neighbors walls to hear half the dialogue. It actually killed the movie for me. Felt like I had no idea what was going on because I missed half the dialogue.</p> <p>Feels like we&#39;re approaching a point where the movies will just be explosions that cause",
