<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently developed an interest in RISC-V SBCs. I was looking for a board similar to the Raspberry Pi 3, only to find out that both the Milk-V Mars and Orange Pi RV are completely out of stock. The Milk-V Duo 256 and Duo S are available, but they are too limited in their capabilities.</p> <p>How could i get my hands on one? Is there some popular, available alternative that i do not know of? </p> <p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you very much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/parabellun"> /u/parabellun </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ihb0ep/availablity_question_any_recommendations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ihb0ep/availablity_question_any_recommendations/">[comments]</a></span>
