Sounds backward, but excess heat can be a big problem for solar panels. It drags down their efficiency and can even shorten their lifespan. So, how do you keep something that\u2019s basking in the sun all day from overheating? Combine solar panels with a heat pump. The heat pump swoops in, grabs the excess heat from the panels, and repurposes it to warm your home or water. This dynamic duo keeps the panels cooler, helps the heat pump work more efficiently, and saves you money. But if this combo is such a great idea, why haven\u2019t we been doing it all along? And do the potential energy savings really make up for the hefty upfront costs?\n\nWatch How Zinc Batteries Are Defying Limits https://youtu.be/lWd6I2og-e0?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVide",
