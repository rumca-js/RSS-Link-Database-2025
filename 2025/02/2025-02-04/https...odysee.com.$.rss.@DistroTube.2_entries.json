        "description": "DistroTube (DT) is a YouTube channel started by me, Derek Taylor (also DT), in October 2017, where I initially focused on Linux distribution installations and reviews.  As the channel grows and I mature in my role as a content creator, I am trying to spend more time on other Linux-related topics as well, including: app reviews, terminal and command line tutorials, desktop environment and window manager tutorials, Linux news and the occasional live stream event.  <br /><br />\ud83d\udcb0 WANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? <br />Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube<br />Paypal: link in channel header<br /><br />\ud83d\udc55 BUY SHIRTS AND MUGS: <br />Help support this channel by purchasing these fine t-shirts, hoodies and mugs.<br />https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube<br /><br />\ud83d\udde8\ufe0f SOCIAL PLATFORMS: <br />Diaspora: https://diasp.org/people/792034802a050136980b047d7b62795e <br />Mastodon: https://mastodon.technology/@distrotube <br />IRC: irc://freenode #distrotube<br /><br />\ud83d\udcc1 MY CONFIGS:<br />GitLab: ",
