For instance, <em>Krook&#39;s March</em> in a way reminds me of <em>Cloubusting</em> by Kate (though they have different harmonies).</p> <p>Has anyone else noticed this?

Mac game where you would conquer other kingdoms (Flanders, Normandy to name a few). You&#39;d start with one territory on the map, recruit fighters than click on a territory to attack. Game play would be automated from there. Can&#39;t for the life of me remember the name.</p> <p>It was dark ages/medieval times. Fighters were archers and the like.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/emaji33\"> /u/emaji33 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ih4gdo/old_school_mac_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ih4gdo/old_school_mac_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",
