AI built right into the browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Microsoft Edge and Copilot or Brave\u2019s own Leo AI chatbot, Firefox isn\u2019t investing in its own AI capabilities. Instead, the company is building in AI access to third-party chatbots such as Anthropic\u2019s Claude and ChatGPT, plus lesser-known LLMs like HuggingChat and Le Chat Mistral. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of a week ago, this AI capability was labeled \u201cexperimental\u201d and was being pushed to a small part of the Firefox user base. Now, the <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/135.0/releasenotes/\">Firefox release notes</a> state that it\u2019s being pushed out gradually to all users. Additionally, Firefox is providing a wider variety of translations, as Firefox can now translate Chinese, Japanese, and Korean pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some additional features are also welcome.
