Concepts and constraints combined with build tool configuration and judicious use of the preprocessor can enable novel techniques resulting in significant improvements to cross-platform architectures. The techniques are the result of experiences in the video games and embedded software fields; however, the techniques are applicable to high performance scientific code and general applications supporting multiple platforms\n\nThis presentation discusses how various features of C++ may be used to develop high-level and high-performance code in cross-platform projects. It focuses on the design and implementation of a small family of quaternion classes. Quaternions are a small numeric type used extensively in 3D graphics ",
