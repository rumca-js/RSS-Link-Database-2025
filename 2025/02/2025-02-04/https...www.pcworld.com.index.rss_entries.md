<p>Antivirus software is a necessity for today’s online world. Attacks have become more sophisticated, especially <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2563436/ai-impersonators-will-wreck-online-security-in-2025-heres-what-to-watch-out-for.html">with the aid of AI</a>. Even the tech-savvy and cautious can drop their guard at the wrong time or get tricked into exposing themselves to malware, spyware, or ransomware. Antivirus protection is an essential backup against such threats. </p>



<p>Most PCs come with security software baked into the OS, but for some folks, an upgrade can help demystify and simplify online security. To help you choose a good suite, we’ve identified products that offer excellent protection, worthwhile features, and minimal performance impact on your computer.</p>

<p>When’s the last time you did some PC spring cleaning? All those unused and unnecessary files that have built up over the years could be slowing down your system and even making your data vulnerable to prying eyes. You have to optimize all that.</p>



<p>One of the easiest way to do it is to use CCleaner — and right now <a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p44146-ccleaner_6_professional_1-pc">CCleaner Professional is on sale for just $14.95</a> on the PCWorld Store. That’s a 63 percent discount for a 1-year/1-device license.</p>



<p>Our friends over at Tech Advisor <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/722583/ccleaner-professional-review.html">reviewed CCleaner Professional</a> and gave it a 4.5-star rating and their Editors’ Choice award as they found it’s not only affordable but also offers solid performance.

<p>We regularly review the latest smart locks–deadbolts, most often–reporting our impression on their design, installation process, daily use, their related mobile app, and more. What we <em>can’t</em> tell you is how well the lock will withstand years of exposure to the elements, how many open/close cycles it should deliver before it fails, or how difficult it will be for an intruder to defeat it—either by lockpick or brute force.</p>



<p>To answer those thorny questions, we consult the ANSI and BHMA standards bodies, both of which provide ratings about the long-term physical capabilities of a lock. But what do those ratings mean, and why doesn’t every lock manufacturer use them?</p>



<p>Let’s dig deeper.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for a new gaming monitor, you don’t have to choose between speed, panel quality, and a good deal anymore. Fast monitors with IPS panels, combining gaming performance and color accuracy, are easier than ever to find at lower prices.</p>



<p>Take this 27-inch Alienware monitor, for example. Amazon is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2724DM-Gaming-Monitor-Overclock/dp/B0CCW7JLYH/">selling it for just $199.99</a>, a whopping $180 off the original retail price.</p>



<p>The Alienware AW2724DM is a relatively basic design that nails its core features. You get a 2560×1440 resolution, 165Hz of refresh (180Hz overclocked) for silky-smooth frames while gaming, and support for both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync. And again, that IPS panel is far more accurate than the VA LCDs you usually see on budget gaming monitors.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has quickly transitioned from a sci-fi concept to a tangible, real-world tool seemingly overnight. But while AI chatbots like ChatGPT have grabbed headlines for their early successes and mistakes, on-device AI is set to be the next step in their evolution as convenient and powerful assistive tools for everyone. Devices powered by Snapdragon X Series platforms are at the forefront of this transformation, providing businesses and organizations with AI capabilities that are changing how we all work and collaborate — and will continue to do so in the future.</p>



<p>What sets Snapdragon apart from x86 compatible processors is its Windows on Snapdragon features. A powerful NPU accelerates AI tasks like voice and image processing, while a high-performance, low-power CPU ensures smooth and efficient operation, even with demanding ta

<p>What makes this Zolo portable charger the one to get? Well, it has a 10,000mAh capacity, which should be enough for about two full recharges of a smartphone. It’s not super huge, but it’s more than enough for a power bank you’re paying less than $13 for.</p>
