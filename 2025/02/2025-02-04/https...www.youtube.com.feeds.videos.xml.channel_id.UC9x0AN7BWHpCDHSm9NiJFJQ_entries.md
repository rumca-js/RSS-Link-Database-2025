Your Remote Desktop SUCKS. Windows Remote Desktop? Locked behind Windows Pro. Windows to Mac? Nope. My editors just switched to Mac, and now they need to remote in from home—but there’s no way to do it. Linux? xRDP? VNC? Too clunky, too complicated.

I want one remote desktop to rule them all—free, open-source, and working seamlessly on Mac, Linux, AND Windows. And guess what? I found it. In this video, I’ll show you the BEST remote-desktop solution you’ve never heard of. Plus, I’ll walk you through setting it up step-by-step so you can finally have a remote desktop that just WORKS.
