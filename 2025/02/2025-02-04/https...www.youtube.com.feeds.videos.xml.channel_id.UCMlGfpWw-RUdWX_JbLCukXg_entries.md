C++ 20 Innovations: High-Performance Cross-Platform Architecture in C++ - Noah Stein - CppCon 2024
---

C++ 20 developers do not need to sacrifice high-level expressiveness and code cleanliness for high performance when writing cross-platform code. Concepts and constraints combined with build tool configuration and judicious use of the preprocessor can enable novel techniques resulting in significant improvements to cross-platform architectures. The techniques are the result of experiences in the video games and embedded software fields; however, the techniques are applicable to high performance scientific code and general applications supporting multiple platforms

This presentation discusses how various features of C++ may be used to develop high-level and high-performance code in cross-platform projects. It focuses on the design and implementation of a small family of quaternion classes. Quaternions are a small numeric type used extensively in 3D graphics
