However, I don\u2019t have any work experience in IT at this point.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning to take eJPT as my first official certification and then move on to OSCP later. But I\u2019m unsure whether I should first go for the official certifications for the subjects I\u2019ve already studied or jump straight into eJPT and OSCP.</p> <p>Will not having these foundational certifications or any work experience in IT hold me back in pursuing a career in penetration testing, or is focusing directly on the advanced certifications the better route?</p> <p>Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
