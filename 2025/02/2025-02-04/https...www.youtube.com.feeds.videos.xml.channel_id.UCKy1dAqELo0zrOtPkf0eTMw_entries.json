        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nMicrosoft has a big month ahead for Game Pass, as the highly-anticipated RPG, Avowed, hits the service for Ultimate subscribers. The game has been in development for more than five years and is set within the Pillars of Eternity universe. Madden NFL 25 also hits the service via EA Play, Another Crab's Treasure returns to the service via the Standard tier, and more are coming in this first wave of games. In Nintendo news, the company is seeing struggling hardware sales of their nearly eight-year-old Switch, but that's to be expected considering they just announced the Switch 2. However, the Switch has already sold around 150 million units, so its legacy is safely cemented as one of the best-selling consoles of all time. And finally, a new Helldivers update brings with it a new Warbond and...a shovel?\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
