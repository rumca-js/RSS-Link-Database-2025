I&#39;ll mostly use it when I&#39;m staying at hotels or just away from home. I plan to use it for watching videos/movies and playing lighter indie games. The most high spec game I might consider playing on it is something like Outer Wilds if that.</p> <p>What I need advice on is which Linux version I should go with and what kinda laptop hardware I should be looking for. I&#39;ve already got my eyes on either Debian Ubuntu OR Fedora for Linux, but I welcome opinions. As for laptop I&#39;m drawing a complete blank. I just don&#39;t know much about the options for laptops though I suppose the thing I&#39;d be most worried about is overheating.</p> <p>I have built a desktop PC so I&#39;m familiar with components, but I know laptops can be handled differently since they require smaller parts. Any ideas or suggestions would be welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;d like some advice here. For a few days, steam hasn&#39;t been launching for me. Even after a full reinstall it&#39;s been iffy. For example, this morning it wouldn&#39;t work, but tonight it&#39;s fine. None of my games were working. I&#39;m behind on windows updates &amp; the pc health check app says i don&#39;t have secure boot or tpm enabled, so i guess I can&#39;t install updates. Since I don&#39;t have tpm 2.0 how should I proceed? Would linux be viable for me? I did install mint on a USB today but haven&#39;t had a chance to try it. Might have to wait till tomorrow. How is making the jump to linux? My editing software, resolve is compatible thankfully. Also i built this system in 2020. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/justarussian22\"> /u/justarussian22 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ih600e/win_11_not_able_to_meet_update_requirements/\">[link]",
