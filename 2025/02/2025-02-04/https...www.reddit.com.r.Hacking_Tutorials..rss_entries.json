If you have looked deep within yourself and found that&#39;s really what you want to achieve, keep reading. Otherwise, stop reading now and go do something else. </p> <p>&quot;Becoming a hacker&quot; isn&#39;t easy. It requires hours and hours of hard work and dedication. A hacker isn&#39;t someone who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and is good with computers. It isn&#39;t someone who logs into other people&#39;s accounts. It isn&#39;t someone who just sends scam pages to email addresses. </p> <p>A hacker, in my own words, is someone who loves computer systems and has a unique thought process. When the Average Joe thinks about a computer, he thinks it&#39;s just a piece of technology to view websites and watch videos. He only knows about the Windows operating system, ",
