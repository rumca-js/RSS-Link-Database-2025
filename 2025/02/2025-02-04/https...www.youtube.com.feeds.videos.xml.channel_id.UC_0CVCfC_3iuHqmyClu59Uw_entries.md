We just installed Bazzite OS (basically Steam Deck OS) on the brand new Lenovo Legion Go S, and it's INSANE!  This handheld gaming PC is packing some serious power with the AMD Ryzen Z2 Go, 32GB of RAM, and an 8" 120Hz VRR screen.  We're diving into gameplay, performance, and everything you need to know about running Linux on this beast. Lenovo is even releasing an official Steam OS version, but we couldn't wait! Check out our first impressions of Bazzite and see why this is shaping up to be an awesome portable gaming rig!
