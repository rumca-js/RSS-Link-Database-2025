<p>2025 began in turmoil, with layoffs at some of the largest tech companies despite the support shown by the new US administration. 2024 had been a year of recovery, with the pace of layoffs slowing and IT employment the highest for years following two years of massive IT layoff in 2022 and 2023.</p>



<p>According to data compiled by <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Layoffs.fyi</a>, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,193 tech companies laid off 264,220 staff in 2023, dropping to “just” 152,104 employees laid off by 547 companies in 2024. In 2025, it has already logged 7,003 staff laid off by 31 companies.</p>

<p>According to a new policy document from Meta, the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/meta-frontier-ai-framework/?utm_source=newsroom&utm_medium=web&utm_content=Frontier_AI_Framework_PDF&utm_campaign=Our_Approach_to_Frontier_AI_blog">Frontier AI Framework</a>, the company might not release AI systems developed in-house in certain risky scenarios.</p>



<p>The document defines two types of AI systems that can be classified as either “high risk” or “critical risk.” In both cases, these are systems that could help carry out cyber, chemical or biological attacks.</p>



<p>Systems classified as “high risk” might facilitate such an attack, though not to the same extent as a “critical risk”

<p>One of a handful of “independent” iOS app stores in Europe has begun the distribution of a porn app, advertising it as “Apple Approved.” The app isn’t approved by Apple, and the biggest app available on the AltStore is Epic’s child-focused <em>Fortnite</em> game. <em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games also invested in the AltStore, which now seems on track to become Europe’s place for iOS porn. </p>



<p>What an achievement.</p>



<p>It’s all thanks to the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3802271/europe-takes-a-second-look-at-apples-dma-compliance.html">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA). </p>

<p>Adobe has introduced contract intelligence features in Acrobat AI Assistant, targeting enterprises and professionals dealing with complex agreements. The new capabilities, announced on Tuesday, enable users to analyze legal terms, compare multiple contracts, and verify key details with AI-generated summaries while maintaining data security.</p>



<p>The expansion comes as businesses struggle with contract management inefficiencies, which can lead to financial and operational risks. According to an Adobe Acrobat <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/02/04/top-5-takeaways-from-new-contracts-survey-most-people-sign-before-they-read">survey</a>, 64% of small business owners have avoided

<p>With the number of generative AI trials soaring in the enterprise, it is typical for the CIO to purchase numerous large language models from various model makers, tweaked for different geographies and languages. But CIOs are discovering that non-English models are faring far more poorly than English ones, even when purchased from the same vendor.</p>



<p>There is nothing nefarious about that fact. It is simply because there is a lot less data available to train non-English models.</p>



<p>“It is almost guaranteed that all LLM implementations in languages other than English will perform with less accuracy and less relevance than implementations in English because of the vast disparity in tra

<p>Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, has been facing scrutiny from governments and private entities worldwide but that hasn’t stopped enterprises from investing in this OpenAI competitor.</p>



<p>European regulators joined <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3813040/microsoft-first-raises-doubts-about-deepseek-and-then-adds-it-to-its-cloud.html">Microsoft, OpenAI, and the US government</a> last week in independent efforts to determine if DeepSeek infringed on any copyrighted data from any US technology vendor. The investigations could potentially lead to a ban on DeepSeek in the US and EU, impacting millions of dollars that enterprises are already pouring into deploying DeepSeek AI models.

## AMD patches microcode security holes after accidental early disclosure

<p>AMD on Monday issued two patches for <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3809165/amds-unpatched-chip-microcode-glitch-may-require-extreme-measures-by-cisos.html">severe microcode security flaws</a>, defects that AMD said “could lead to the loss of Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) protection.” The bugs were inadvertently revealed by a partner last week. </p>



<p>The most dangerous time for this kind of security hole is right after it is disclosed and before patches are applied. Due to the nature of microcode patches, enterprise users now have to wait for OEMs and other partners to implement the fixes in their hardware-specific microcode.</p>
