But what stands out is how they justify their opposition.\n\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic (creator of the popular Claude AI), argues for banning the export of powerful chips to China. Not because DeepSeek are \"adversaries\u201d but because their government has \u201ccommitted human rights violations, has behaved aggressively on the world stage\u201d. https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls\n\nThe irony of this moral argument coming from a US executive is hard to miss. The United States' history of military interventions, support for authoritarian regimes, and human rights violations with advanced weaponry means such criticism could just as easily be turned around to argue for restricting American access to AI technology.\n\nOn LinkedIn, Rene Bystron, the CEO of AI company DeltaGen, shares a video demonstrating how DeepSeek refuses to answer questions ",
