<p>It's been 25 years since Maxis first introduced us to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims/">The Sims</a> and began wasting so, so much of our time. EA, not too surprisingly, has taken advantage of this major anniversary to re-release both The Sims and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-2/">The Sims 2</a>, with all DLC included and the games updated for modern computers. And as you take this dose of nostalgia, you may find yourself looking for some cheats to help you reacquaint yourself with the original classic.</p><p>We've got you covered. Since this re-release of The Sims 1 is just that--an updated version of the existing game, rather than a remake or remaster--not much has changed about how cheating works in the original Sims title. You don't have to mess with game files or command lines or anything like that. You simply fire up the game, and once you're in it, <strong>press ctrl+shft+C to pull up the console where you can enter codes</strong>--and th

<p>EA is partying like it's 2004--and that's because the publisher is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its juggernaut franchise The Sims with brand-new re-releases of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims/">The Sims</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-2/">The Sims 2</a> that include all their DLC and work on modern systems. Since it's been quite a while since most of us have messed with The Sims 2--EA stopped supporting the title when it released The Sims 3 back in 2009, after all--we could use a bit of a helping hand as we revisit this old classic.

Showrunner Craig Mazin said in an interview that Season 2 will not follow the timeline of the game exactly.

I spent my weekly allowance to play VF and VF2 in arcades, cavorted cross-country in search of rare Virtua Fighter 3 cabinets, and eventually connected with overseas friends by playing VF4 Evolution and Final Tuned in Japan. So when I see a new--or new-ish, in this case--Virtua Fighter game get released, I want it to be the best it can possibly be. Not just for myself, but so others can pick it up and understand why we longtime Virtua Fighter players adore these games so much.</p><p dir="ltr">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown--released a few years back on PS4--was a solid attempt at this, bringing the much-loved VF5 Final Showdown to PS4 with a fresh coat of paint.

Now, with a new Virtua Figh

<p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> reveal event in January, Nintendo showed off the console's updated Joy-Con controllers and seemingly teased mouse-like functionality. Such a feature would be "intriguing," according to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Civilization VII </a>executive producer Dennis Shirk.</p><p>Shirk told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-remains-coy-on-nintendo-switch-2-mouse-joy-con">IGN</a>, "It's definitely intriguing." A control setup like that could in theory help games like Civilization be embraced on console, but it's too soon to say if the mouse-like controls for Switch 2 are real or if Civilization VII could come to the Switch 2 (the game is only confirmed for the original Switch right now). Shirk said it "would be cool" for the Switch 2 to offer some kind of mouse-like control functionality.</p><p>"

<p>Unlike other games, it's difficult to put an exact timeframe on just how long it takes to beat a playthrough of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Civilization VII</a>. For starters, the first couple of hours when you begin can be so daunting from a gameplay perspective, so you might spend more time reading the encyclopedia than actually playing.

<p>Elgato has announced a brand-new version of its free digital audio mixer took, dubbed Wave Link 2.0.

<p>Nintendo has revealed new Switch sales figures from the first nine months of the current financial year--ending on March 31, 2025--and while sales of the console and its games have been below expectations, there is a silver lining here. The Switch has sold over 150 million units since launch, making it the first console to do so in 13 years.</p><p>The last video game console to reach these numbers was also a Nintendo device (<a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/1886674034206593488">as spotted by Stealth on X</a>), specifically the Nintendo DS. The dual-screen handheld had numerous hardware revisions over its lifespan, ranging from the original futuristic clamshell model to a streamlined design before the Nintendo 3DS eventually succeeded it, and it was quite popular with Nintendo fans thanks to its strong library of games and affordable pricing.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6465596" data-src="/videos/nintendo-switch-2-official-first-look-reveal-trailer/230
