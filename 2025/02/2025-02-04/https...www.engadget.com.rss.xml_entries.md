<p>Google has made one of the most substantive changes to its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">AI principles</a> since first publishing them in 2018. In a change spotted by <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/04/google-ai-policies-weapons-harm"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the search giant edited the document to remove pledges it had made promising it would not &quot;design or deploy&quot; AI tools for use in weapons or surveillance technology. Previously, those guidelines included a section titled &quot;applications we will not pursue,&quot; which is not present in the current version of the document.</p>
<p>Instead, there&#39;s now a section titled &quot;responsible development and deployment.&quot; There, Google says it will implement &quot;appropriate human oversight, due diligence, and feedback mechanisms to align with user goals, social responsibility, and widely accepted princip

This is a first-person action RPG from the company that brought us <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, so it’s a pretty big deal. It’s a spinoff of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, though set in a new land.</p>

With the AI Assistant enabled, the Acrobat app will be able to recognize if a document is a contract, even if it's a scanned page. It can identify and list key terms from there, summarize the document's contents and recommend questions you can ask based on what's in it.</p>

<p><a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/opera/"><ins>Opera</ins></a> is introducing Opera Air, a new web browser designed around mindfulness. The app has a “minimalist Scandinavian design” and frosted glass accents, which blend well with the mindfulness concept. While pretty, Opera Air has features for relaxation, concentration, resting, and more, which you normally only see in meditation apps.</p>
<p>There are four break modes: breathing, neck exercises, meditation and  “full body scan.” Breathing exercises and meditation can help calm you down by lowering stress levels, while neck exercises help loosen sore neck muscles. The full body scan is a different type of meditation that involves focusing your attention on various body parts and the sensations that arise. These breaks can be as short as three minutes or as long as 15. Breaks can be taken voluntarily or by setting a timer.</p>
