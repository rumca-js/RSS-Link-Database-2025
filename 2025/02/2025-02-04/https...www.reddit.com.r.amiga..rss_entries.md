<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need help please...<br/> My partner/bf is quite involved in the Amiga scene, organizing demo parties and what not. Now, I wanted to surprise him and make a really simple demo. I thought that with a little help from ChatGPT and Youtube that can&#39;t be too hard, but I can&#39;t get this sh** to work...<br/> What I&#39;ve got: I&#39;ve downloaded ROMs from amiga forever and FS-uae (sitting with a new mcbook air) and copied the roms into the fs-uae folder - so far so good.<br/> I got in the Workbench but not further... It was just a hand holding a disc. So ChatGPT told me to download AMOS pro which I did. I downloaded Amos pro 2.0 6 files plus 3 update files and copied them all into the fs-uae folder for floppy discs.<br/> I then thought it worked as I could access Amos and start coding BUT I can&#39;t save files as I can&#39;t write an &quot;:&quot; in the program, I get a syntax error very often (might be ChatGPTs fault though) and other bugs. So I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am slowly getting back in the loop after 30+ years of not using an Amiga. I am getting a 500 in a few days that already has a HDMI mod and the Gotek floppy mod. Is there some Compact Flash module I can get that would allow it to act like a hard drive? I‚Äôve been looking at a few shops but am a bit confused and not sure if these work or not on a 500, or if they require a 600/1200.</p> <p>Besides the mods that this comes with, is there anything else worthwhile I can look into? It‚Äôs already coming with 1MB of chip ram upgraded from 512KB</p> <p>Thanks for any help. I hope to contribute a lot more soon enough. I found a box of over 400 floppies in my parents basement from when I was running the BBS in 90s. I hope there are some gems I can share with the community once I remember how the Amiga works</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DonFazool"> /u/DonFazool </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.
