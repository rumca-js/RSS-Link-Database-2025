<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I’m currently studying and training in cybersecurity, with a solid understanding of the basics of A+ Core 2, CCNA, Linux+, Security+, having completed the content for these certifications and taken practice tests, but I haven’t taken the official exams yet. However, I don’t have any work experience in IT at this point.</p> <p>I’m planning to take eJPT as my first official certification and then move on to OSCP later. But I’m unsure whether I should first go for the official certifications for the subjects I’ve already studied or jump straight into eJPT and OSCP.</p> <p>Will not having these foundational certifications or any work experience in IT hold me back in pursuing a career in penetration testing, or is focusing directly on the advanced certifications the better route?</p> <p>Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddi

It honestly sounded pretty good at first but the more I think about it the worse it gets lol.</p> <p>So its 6 days work - 3 days break - 4 days work - 3 days break and repeat</p> <p>On the 6 days of work I work from 6:30-2:30am on the first two days then from 2:30 - 10:30pm on the next two and from 10:30pm to 6:30am on the last 2 days</p> <p>On the 4 days of work I am free to start whenever I want to I just have to do 8 hours of work on each day.</p> <p>Also once per week I would have to drive into the office which is like a 75 minute drive away.</p> <p>It seems somewhat reasonable at first but it also means I would barely have any weekends off and my personal life would be nonexistent. Looking for some thoughts as to wether you guys think this is worth it to get an entry into the field or not.
