<p>Firefox 135 debuts today, with (what else?) AI built right into the browser.</p>



<p>Unlike Microsoft Edge and Copilot or Brave’s own Leo AI chatbot, Firefox isn’t investing in its own AI capabilities. Instead, the company is building in AI access to third-party chatbots such as Anthropic’s Claude and ChatGPT, plus lesser-known LLMs like HuggingChat and Le Chat Mistral. </p>



<p>As of a week ago, this AI capability was labeled “experimental” and was being pushed to a small part of the Firefox user base. Now, the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/135.0/releasenotes/">Firefox release notes</a> state that it’s being pushed out gradually to all users. Additionally, Firefox is providing a wider variety of translations, as Firefox can now translate Chinese, Japanese, and Korean pages.</p>



<p>Some additional features are also welcome. Firefox

<p>I got my first mortgage three years ago — and when I did, I read every word of the contract. It was a horrible experience, not just for me but also for the bank manager whom I pestered into explaining every clause or term I didn’t understand.</p>



<p>According to Adobe, you no longer need to go through that… at least if you trust its AI system to summarize your contracts for you.</p>



<p>“Contract Intelligence” is what Adobe is calling <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/02/04/top-5-takeaways-from-new-contracts-survey-most-people-sign-before-they-read#:~:text=Introducing%20new%20contract%20intelligence%20in%20Acrobat%20AI%20Assistant">the new Acrobat AI Assistance feature</a>. It can recognize contracts in PDFs or scanned documents, then generate overviews that are more digestible. “Acrobat AI Assistant generates summaries and responses wit

## Best USB-C cables 2025: Get quality charging and data transfers

<p>It’s easy to think that all USB-C cables are the same, and that any claims to superiority are just a way to jack up the price. After all, it’s <em>just a cable</em>, right?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is understandable, but the fact is, there really can be differences among cables. At PCWorld we’ve had experience using tons of USB-C cables and can say with confidence that not all of them are made the same. There can be huge performance variances among cables when it comes to both charging and transferring data.</p>



<p>My hands-on evaluation of numerous cables — ranging from the biggest, most-recognizable brand-names to the cheapest of the cheap — has revealed some clear winners.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me: </strong>PCWorld has been testing hardware since the 1980s and I’ve been poking and prodding PC components since I cracked open my Commo

<p>Psst. Do you know what apps and services are connected to your Google or Apple account?</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right—your online accounts may be linked to third-party apps, websites, and/or services. Think eBay, Reddit, Pinterest, and a number of other consumer sites. And not just Google or Apple accounts can have these ties, but potentially others like Facebook, Microsoft, and X/Twitter. </p>
