## Is EasyNews fast only the first weeks?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I signed up for EasyNews in mid January. Picked it because it was cheap and worked in the browser on iPad. Went for an unlimited deal for a year. I really enjoyed it for streaming. Everything was fast, but now it isn‚Äôt anymore. Think two hours now for a 7GB file, meaning streaming also sucks. Have tried switching servers, checked my internet and all of that, but it still feels slow. I‚Äôm in Europe and usually I get best speeds from USA east. Europe did give me fast speeds, but now it‚Äôs usually less than 10mbps. But of course even if the server test gives me a faster server, it doesn‚Äôt mean the file downloads at that speed. </p> <p>I do wonder if they limit speeds after the first weeks? I‚Äôm on unlimited, but does it get better if I pay more? An alternative service maybe?<br/> I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs something better for movie iso. I have 4K blu-rays, but I notice that newer versions of the movie I own come with dolby vision and atmos. I also enioy bon

## Usenetserver no longer has a USA location?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When downloading from <a href="http://news.usenetserver.com"><strong>news.usenetserver.com</strong></a>, I inspected the source of the data and noticed multiple IP addresses, such as <a href="http://85.12.62.240"><strong>85.12.62.240</strong></a> and <a href="http://85.12.62.221"><strong>85.12.62.221</strong></a>, which appear to be based in the Netherlands. This makes me wonder: Does UsenetServer no longer have servers located in the United States? (I only checked because I was getting lower speeds on the West Coast compared to the East Coast.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Outside-Bathroom6250"> /u/Outside-Bathroom6250 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ihbpwl/usenetserver_no_longer_has_a_usa_location/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ihbpwl/usenetserver_no_longer_has_a_usa_location/">[comments]</a></span>
