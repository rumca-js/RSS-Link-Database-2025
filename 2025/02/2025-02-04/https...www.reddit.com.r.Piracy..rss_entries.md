<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, complete and utter tourist here:</p> <p>I occasionally use websites to pirate stuff that I wanna watch, but with that bill that promises to probably strike these sites down, I was just wondering what kind of stuff that people who actually know what they&#39;re doing do to get their shows or what not? Was wondering since piracy right now is just way too convenient to give up. Streaming services just seem like a pain in the ass to deal with.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CopywriteClaimWizard"> /u/CopywriteClaimWizard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ih9e0g/some_of_the_better_ways_to_pirate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ih9e0g/some_of_the_better_ways_to_pirate/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok so I have a cracked software installed from 2015 that is no longer available in any legitimate form.The rlm liicence and exe replacement from the crack work fine and allow the program to run as normal but the soft itself has some kind of timer that after passing (roughly 10 minutes) will replace any saved or exported file with a predetermined one that says “get x software at x.com” </p> <p>I have tried procmon, cheat engine, ghidra etc looking for the timer or the call to a home that no longer exists but it’s a bit too far beyond my skills. This app is ideal for my needs and although there are newer and potentially better, even free (ish) alternatives I would prefer this one! Sadly it was bought and killed by a large tech company and so I’m looking for anyone who might know weather this is firstly solvable and if so maybe willing to help somehow!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CombinationCont
