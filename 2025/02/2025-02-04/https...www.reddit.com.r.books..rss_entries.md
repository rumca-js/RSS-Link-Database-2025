<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEPDLFSUPe0">this interview</a> of Harold Bloom, in which he says he hopes children move on from reading Harry Potter to reading &quot;high literature,&quot; such as Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read Alice a few times. Why is this book so fawned over by critics? I get that it was original in its time, but I can&#39;t really see how modern kids have anything to gain from it. It&#39;s just a fun story with witty prose. You can&#39;t really study it or gain some new insight into the human condition. It&#39;s not even <em>that</em> clever, is it? I&#39;m just struggling to find any &quot;high&quot; value in this book other than &quot;it was new at the time.&quot; Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KidCharlemagneII"> /u/KidCharlemagneII </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ihvey7/w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TW: SA </p> <p>Octavia Butler is one of my personal favorite writers as of recent, and I just finished Dawn, the first novel in the Xenogenisis trilogy today. Like Butler&#39;s other works, It had a lot of great things about it, but it&#39;s easily one of the most genuinely unsettling novels I&#39;ve ever read, and the most conflicting of Butler&#39;s novels I&#39;ve come across so far (including Kindred and the Parable duology) </p> <p>In Dawn, Butler uses the familiar sci-fi trope of humans being abducted by aliens to explore themes such as consent, bodily autonomy, colonialism, and what it means to be human. After Earth is destroyed in a nuclear war, Lilith, the protagonist, along with the rest of the survivors of the human race, are forced into a breeding program with the Ooloi, the third sex of the Oankali alien race, in exchange for the Oankali making the Earth habitable again, and to eventually repopulate the Earth with offspring of human and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>This is a bit of an odd question. I’m not a conspiracy theorist at all, I don’t believe in lizard people or Qanon. However at the same time, there are some real conspiracies like Watergate, Epstein and so on. </p> <p>My question is, is there a history of books being used as part of a conspiracy or propaganda campaign. Where a book is published and it appears to be innocent, but it later comes out that there was some dark money behind it, to inject a story. Were books used like this before the internet and podcasts?</p> <p>The reason I ask is, a month ago I was in a shop and some old books were being sold for charity. I leafed through them and spotted one called ‘A Dream Too Far’. I read a bit, it’s a fairly generic thriller, an airport novel about a conspiracy involving the United States of Europe. Nothing too shocking and it seemed decent for what it was, a totalitarian state is a great plotline, I loved Handmaid’s Tale and 1984. Howev

Seems you might want to detail your encounter with aliens but I didn’t see anything about any of that. Was he just hoping people would open up the tubes and figure it out?</p> <p>.2.
