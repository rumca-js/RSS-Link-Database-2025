<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Iâ€™ve been working on a project that I think many of you might enjoy: <a href="https://www.hehepedia.ai"><strong>Hehepedia</strong></a>, an AI-powered platform where you can generate and explore fictional encyclopedias in a Wikipedia-like format.</p> <p>The idea is simple: you describe a wiki topic, and Hehepedia generates a homepage, links to related pages, as well as images. You can expand your wiki as easily as clicking article links. The LLM ensures internal consistency and creativity as pages are created (for those interested, I am using Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking experimental for text and and flux.1-dev for images right now).</p> <p>Iâ€™m looking for testers to come play around with the platform, create wikis, and share feedback. Some points I&#39;m looking for feedback on:</p> <p>- Experience: is it fun? Intuitive? Confusing?<br/> - Creativity and consistency: Do the wikis feel interesting and internally coherent?<br/> - Performance/formatting: An

Yeah, censorship isn&#39;t great and pro-party propaganda sucks but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the only reason why everyone is so outraged.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AI chatbots and virtual assistants are getting better at recognizing emotions and responding in an empathetic way, but <strong>are they truly understanding emotions, or just mimicking them?</strong></p> <p>ðŸ”¹ Models like ChatGPT, Bard and claude can generate emotionally intelligent responses, but they donâ€™t actually &quot;feel&quot; anything.<br/> ðŸ”¹ AI can recognize tone and sentiment, but it doesnâ€™t experience emotions the way humans do.<br/> ðŸ”¹ Some argue that <strong>true emotional intelligence requires subjective experience</strong>, which AI lacks.</p> <p>As AI continues to advance, could we reach a point where it <strong>not only mimics emotions but actually &quot;experiences&quot; something like them</strong>? Or will AI always be just a highly sophisticated mirror of human emotions?</p> <p>Curious to hear what the community thinks! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’­</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Www_anatoly"> /u/Www_ana

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im having triuble with a rule section in my prompt where it keeps writing measurements as words not numerically, here is the rule:</p> <p>Write numbers 1 to 9 in words, whereas anything 10 and higher should be written in numbers. Time (e.g., 2pm, 4am) and physical measurements must always be written using numerals (e.g., 7x7m, 12kg). For example, a shed measuring 7x7m should be written as &#39;7x7m&#39;, not &#39;seven by seven meters&#39;. Use only numerals for measurements. Correct: 7x7m shed. Incorrect: seven by seven meter shed. Reasoning: Consistency in numerical representation of measurements is crucial for clarity and technical accuracy. Therefore, always use digits.</p> <p>It was originally different until i tweaked it based on gemini recommendations like adding reasoning. But everything change i make it persistently writes measurements in words not numerically</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/
