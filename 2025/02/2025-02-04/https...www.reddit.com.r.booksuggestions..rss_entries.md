I think I just really love poetic and thoughtful prose that makes me go “oh my god that’s an incredible line.” </p> <p>I’m not big on realistic fiction, I like for there to be some kind of magic or mystical element. Real world problems tend to hit a little close to home for me.</p> <p>Every time I try to find something on goodreads, social media or Audible I get so overwhelmed.
