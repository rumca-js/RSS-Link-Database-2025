I checked it and I like 1) it&#39;s co-op, 2) it&#39;s fantasy, 3) the theme. </p> <p>I read that it is recommended for 12+ years old but I also read (on local board games web) that a lot of people play it with small (under 10) kids. The design of components also seems very kids-oriented.</p> <p>So... is it for kids (or family with small kids oriented), or not? I read that there are several difficulty levels but idk more.</p> <p>We are two adults, no kids, unlikely we&#39;ll play in more players than the two of us. Our favorite board game is Spirit Island.

I started out with Codenames, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Splendor, and the like, then we got into Catan, Cascadia, Century, PARKS, Carcassone, Dead of Winter, Cosmic Encounter, HEAT, etc. My other friend we play with brings Pandemic and Burgle Bros to the table too. As you can see, the group I host isn&#39;t into very heavy games and crunchy Euros. Although I enjoyed a few Euros with other friends, I don&#39;t get the feeling that my group will enjoy games that have low player interaction and cause a lot of AP. We like a bit of chaotic fun and enjoy chatting as we play and in between play too.</p> <p>With all that said, I wonder if Ticket to Ride would be a good game to buy and introduce to the group? I like the thought of owning modern classics, like Carcassone and Catan - the former is a game my partner and I LOVE and the latter is a game I don&#39;t care m",
