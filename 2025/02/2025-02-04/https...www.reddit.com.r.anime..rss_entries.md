The story/plot is also really interesting to me.</p> <p>I also just finished Violet Evergarden (I liked it enough to watch the series and the move, but definitely didn&#39;t love it), and My Happy Marriage.

After that, she somehow gets transported to another world. </p> <p>The rest of the episode takes place in the next world, where the system offers her the “Hero” job. She refuses it but isn’t given any other option.</p> <p>Throughout the episode, she tries to find work, but no one will hire her since she doesn’t have a “system job” with levels.
