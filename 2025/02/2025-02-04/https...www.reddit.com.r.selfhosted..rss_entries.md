I’ve been looking into Google Cloud Storage and found that if I select an EU server for archive storage, the cost will be only $0.0012 per GB per month. I currently have around 200GB of photos, so this would cost me about $0.24 per month. Does this sound correct? Are there any hidden fees if I need to download the data, similar to AWS? I als

However I love the lightweight-ness of it, and how much simpler it just is compared to NextCloud. </p> <p>So asking you guys of self hosted, I&#39;m basically looking for something like Filebrowsing that allows a few users to drag and drop and access their files, that also has the ability to natively set storage quota per user. </p> <p>Does something like that exist or am I just stuck with Nextcloud? :) Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/

On a single host using Docker this would be super easy with <a href="https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun">Gluetun</a>, but my lab is more complex than that. It runs on a Proxmox server, which contains many LXCs and VMs, some of which are Docker hosts (prod environment, personal NAS, a couple LXCs that are just wrappers around Docker containers, etc) and some of which are not. I want to figure out a way to have one host, ideally an LXC, connect to a Wireguard VPN (Proton, ideally, since I like their platform), and then tunnel several hosts (including Docker containers, LXCs and VMs) throughout the lab through that VPN connection.

## Are there any good self hosted watch together solutions?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(Or maybe even not self hosted, I guess.)</p> <p>I want to watch a video with a friend once a month. So this system does not need to be robust. I will host the video. Two absolute requirements are that she needs to be able to tune in without making an account of any kind whatsoever and it needs to be browser based. No stand alone software on her end. Voice chat to go along with the video would be nice but not a requirement.</p> <p>I&#39;m searching on my own, also. I did find owncast but I&#39;m not too far into their feature list yet. Anyone have any experience with them?</p> <p>Edit: I guess something like a self hosted zoom with screen sharing would work great. We&#39;d use zoom but I think they have a time limit on meetings for free accounts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TidyTomato"> /u/TidyTomato </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ih4pcx/are_there_any_

## Self-hosting LLMs seems pointless—what am I missing?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Don’t get me wrong—I absolutely love self-hosting. If something can be self-hosted and makes sense, I’ll run it on my home server without hesitation.</p> <p>But when it comes to LLMs, I just don’t get it.</p> <p>Why would anyone self-host models like <strong>Ollama, Qwen, or others</strong> when OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic offer models that are <strong>exponentially more powerful</strong>?</p> <p>I get the usual arguments: privacy, customization, control over your data—all valid points. But let’s be real:</p> <ul> <li><p>Running a local model requires <strong>serious GPU and RAM resources</strong> just to get inferior results compared to cloud-based options.</p></li> <li><p>Unless you have major infrastructure, you’re nowhere near the model sizes these big companies can run.</p></li> </ul> <p>So what’s the use case? When is self-hosting actually better than just using an existing provider? </p> <p>Am I missing something big here?</p> <p>I want to b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello All,</p> <p>I&#39;m posting this guide hoping it will help someone. You might be thinking there already is a guide at <a href="https://immich.app/docs/features/command-line-interface/">The Immich CLI | Immich</a>, but it&#39;s kind of shit if you&#39;re trying to run this with docker.</p> <h1>Why would you not just use npm?</h1> <p>In my case, I&#39;m running immich on TrueNAS Scale, so npm isn&#39;t available (and I don&#39;t want to mess with the OS too much).</p> <h1>What you actually need to do:</h1> <p>Navigate to the folder you want to import from before deploying the container, such as:</p> <p><code>cd /mnt/stuff/my-photos</code></p> <p><code>$(pwd)&quot;:/import:ro</code> will map the current location to /import. Then, here&#39;s the tricky part: you need to run the commands (such as upload) along with the docker run command. like so:</p> <pre><code>sudo docker run -it --rm \ -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:/import:ro \ -e IMMICH\_INSTANCE\_URL=h
