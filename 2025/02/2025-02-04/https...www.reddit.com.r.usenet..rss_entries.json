Went for an unlimited deal for a year. I really enjoyed it for streaming. Everything was fast, but now it isn\u2019t anymore. Think two hours now for a 7GB file, meaning streaming also sucks. Have tried switching servers, checked my internet and all of that, but it still feels slow. I\u2019m in Europe and usually I get best speeds from USA east. Europe did give me fast speeds, but now it\u2019s usually less than 10mbps. But of course even if the server test gives me a faster server, it doesn\u2019t mean the file downloads at that speed. </p> <p>I do wonder if they limit speeds after the first weeks? I\u2019m on unlimited, but does it get better if I pay more? An alternative service maybe?<br/> I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something better for movie iso.
