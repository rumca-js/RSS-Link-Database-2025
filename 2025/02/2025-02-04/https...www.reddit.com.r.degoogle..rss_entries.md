## Best VPN Service According to Reddit?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been looking for the best VPN for quite a while now and ended up scrolling through tons of Reddit threads to get some advice. The main takeaway I got is that free VPNs aren’t worth it since they either sell your data or flood you with ads, so a paid VPN is the better option if you care about privacy. </p> <p>The problem is, I’m still not sure which one to go for. From what I’ve seen on Reddit, NordVPN gets a lot of praise. It’s a bit more expensive, but it seems worth it for the features, speed, security, and the ability to watch shows without issues. Their NordLynx feature is supposed to make internet speeds even better, which sounds useful. </p> <p>Surfshark also gets recommended a lot and is cheaper than NordVPN while still offering fast speeds, making it a solid option for streaming. It also has servers in a lot of different locations, which is nice. </p> <p>PIA comes up quite a bit too since it has a ton of servers, works well for streaming
