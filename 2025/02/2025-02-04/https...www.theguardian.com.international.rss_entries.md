On Sunday night, the rapper Kanye West and his wife, the Australian former model and “Yeezy” brand architectural designer Bianca Censori, appeared at the Grammy awards. West wore black sunglasses; Censori wore basically nothing. In a stunt for the cameras, West posed behind Censori as she turned her back to the paparazzi and lowered a long fur coat down her shoulders. When she turned to face the photographers, she was wearing a fully transparent mini dress, and no underwear. The effect was that she appeared completely nude.

<p>The play within the acclaimed prison-set movie made its way to an off-Broadway stage this week with original cast members involved</p><p>Recently, a few hundred people gathered in Manhattan at the New York Theater Workshop to watch a play, first written and performed about 20 years ago, where an Egyptian travels through time attempting to decipher clues that might lead to… well, it’s not entirely clear. But he encounters Robin Hood and his Merry Men, as well as Shakespeare’s Hamlet, among others, with a freewheeling energy that many more traditional productions rarely match. In between songs and monologues, the show’s steady supply of dad-joke puns (Robin Hood hangs out with Fryer Tuck – a fast-food specialist) is a lot less sweaty than certain other Off-Broadway productions we could name.</p><p>If the particulars of Breakin’ the Mummy’s Code sound familiar, it must be from exposure to the recent film Sing Sing; it’s difficult to confuse its plot with any other play. <a href="http

The Irish-British film-maker and his Scottish partner Allison McGourty had spent 10 months researching a film about that massively successful but elusive rock band Led Zeppelin. They put together a storyboard, listened to every interview they could find, and started to dig out archive film to tell the story of the band’s early years in the late 60s.</p><p>That was when Jimmy Page, a successful session guitarist, joined the Yardbirds, then wanted to create a band of his own.

<p>Scrum-half Dupont took time off to snare Olympic gold which has made him even more effective around the rucks</p><p>Tickets to watch France play England this weekend are not cheap. Premium adult seats cost £199 apiece and&nbsp;even the most affordable ones up&nbsp;in the gods will set you back&nbsp;£89. Before you phone the Rugby&nbsp;Football&nbsp;Union to enquire&nbsp;if an England win is included as part of the deal, however, ask yourself how often in life you have the chance to witness pure&nbsp;genius.</p><p>Admittedly this can be a subjective debate. Taylor Swift fans will have a different opinion to, say, Bob Dylan disciples. However, in contemporary sport there can surely be increasingly little debate. With all due respect to the colossal talents of Novak Djokovic, Max Verstappen, Patrick Mahomes, Simone Biles and Mohamed Salah, the name Antoine Dupont must be close to&nbsp;the top of the list.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/04/england-france-antoi

<p>My family and I went to Shetland for my dad’s funeral – and the world suddenly shut down. Overwhelmed by his presence in the house, I found my perspective on our relationship starting to shift</p><p>I wanted to reach out and feel the weight of the speckled eggs in my palm. Guillemot eggs: longer than a chicken’s and slightly pear-like in form, so that when they roll, they do so in a tight arc, rather than towards the cliff edge. There are plenty of cliffs to roll off in Shetland, a group of wind-scalped islands where the North Atlantic and the North Sea crash together, as well as other wild delights, like the precious mosses and orchids threading through the craggy peat&nbsp;bogs. Just over the hill, a low orange glow served as a reminder of a very different island treasure: Sullom Voe, one of the largest oil and gas terminals in Europe.</p><p>I stood by the trestle table staring at the strangely static greenish-blue eggs. A closer look revealed they were not what they seemed; in

The feelgood factor generated by the famous thrashing of Manchester City will not last long if a lack of attacking options means they cannot sustain their challenge in the Premier League. Arteta, who would not allow Kieran Tierney or Jorginho to leave with their contracts expiring in the summer, will be hoping that some winter sunshine in Dubai next week can give his players extra spark when they return. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p>

Some applauded the artist on his clever subversion of traditional artistic tropes. Either way, pretty soon everyone was talking about the banana.</p><p>In November 2024, the banana – not the same banana, obviously, but a fresh banana bought that morning – was taken on a global publicity tour to drum up business before its auction at Sotheby’s.

<p>A Filipino-style slow-cooked stew packed with pungent, salty and sweet-sour flavours</p><p>Lacquered cubes of tender pork belly and caramelised chunks of pineapple are the stars of this twist on <em>adobo</em>, the unofficial dish of the Philippines. A slow-cooked stew spiked with pepper, garlic and floral bay leaves, adobo’s signature flavour combination is vinegar and soy, giving it lick-smacking depth and complexity. There are 16 (yes, 16!) garlic cloves to give it some oomph, but if you are anti-peeling, reduce that number to eight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/04/filipino-pork-belly-with-pineapple-adobo-recipe-lara-lee">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Meteorite falls are extremely rare events that may offer a glimpse of the processes that formed our own world. When a space rock does come to town, a team of amateur sky-watchers are not far behind</p><p>At 21.54 on 28 February 2021, 16 cameras belonging to amateur sky-watching network UKMON picked up a bright shape headed towards Earth. Pictures show a long white line, which was visible for eight minutes, a glowing globule of light against the dark sky. “For me it’s like fishing,” said Richard Kacerek, one of the founders of UKMON. “You cast your line and then you wait. There are days when you catch nothing but there are days when you catch a really, really big fish and it’s so exciting.” The fireball of February 2021 was such a fish: a lump of flaming extraterrestrial rock travelling at a speed of about 8.4 miles a second – 15 times the speed of a rifle bullet – and headed for the Cotswolds market town of Winchcombe.</p><p>Meteorites are rocks from space that have entered our at
