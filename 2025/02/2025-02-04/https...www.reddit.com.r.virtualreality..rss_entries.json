Essentially I want to create a virtual cockpit in Unity that handles interaction with DCS World&#39;s (or Falcon&#39;s) cockpits using the Quest 3&#39;s hand tracking over Oculus Link (this project is also applicable to Vive headsets tho).</p> <p>How would I go about running both at the same time? What if I wanted to draw the hands or cockpit outline from Unity over DCS? Is Virtual Desktop an option for an application like this?</p> <p>I&#39;m primarily looking for documentation or software that would enable this.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EvaLurker\"> /u/EvaLurker </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ihv8dg/draw_a_vr_app_over_another/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ihv8dg/draw_a_vr_app_over_ano",

I have a 4080 S that used to play RDR2 somewhat okay when playing in VR. I tried it with the DLSS 4 function and the difference is really visible! I followed guides on YouTube for activating DLSS 4 in a game by using DLSS swapper to get the latest version for a game and then setting the DLSS settings in the Nvidia app so it uses DLSS 4. I started the game and was really amazed by how much smoother it is now running on pretty high settings on 3472x3472. One can also activate DLAA but have not tried it. I understand it as 30-series cards can also benefit from this upgrade. So if you have been bothered by low performance when playing in VR, give this a shot!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CrazySittingHorse\"> /u/CrazySittingHorse </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ihe8t6/red",
