I colorized, restored, and designed sound for this rare video of Cairo, Egypt in the 1920s. The footage showcases both ancient architecture, tracing back to the Fatimid, Mamluk, and Ottoman periods, and modern European-style buildings, reflecting a city divided between the traditional Arab quarter and the business district. The video also captures the Pyramids of Giza, including the Sphinx, which had just been excavated from the sands.
