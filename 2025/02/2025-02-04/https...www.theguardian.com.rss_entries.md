<p>Joe Wright’s portrayal of the rise of a ridiculous loser features a magnificently disgusting take on the titular fascist and is packed with lavish visuals – even if it does drag a tad</p><p>Before the real horrors of 20th-century fascism arrived, the long speeches were a sign that something was badly wrong: thousands of ordinary people at rallies, who don’t simply walk away when a man with obvious personality problems stands there spitting specious slogans, shows you when a country is in extremis. Totalitarianism’s propensity for being tedious as well as grotesque is captured rather too well by the director Joe Wright’s lavish, stagey Mussolini: Son of the Century, an eight-part dramatisation of Antonio Scurati’s prize-winning book. It’s quite a spectacle, but it doesn’t half go on. <br><br>

<p>Sir Keir Starmer’s caution has yet to persuade voters, while discontent fuels a resurgent right that thrives by boosting anti-immigrant, climate-sceptic views</p><p>Over the past 15 years, British politics has been defined by the tension between ideals and practicality.

<p>A rightwing thinktank has been targeting the royal ever since he confessed to taking drugs – and is demanding his immigration forms be released</p><p>While he may not be quite as popular as he was, Prince Harry still has a lot of fans in the US. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is not one of them: the president has never had anything nice to say about the Duke of Sussex and once claimed that the Biden administration was “too gracious” to the British immigrant. Which might not be a big deal were it not for the fact that some Trumpers have long been chomping at the bit to get Harry deported.</p><p>The Heritage Foundation, a rightwing thinktank famous for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/nov/04/what-is-project-2025-trump">masterminding Project 2025</a>, a roadmap for Trump’s second term, <a href="https://www.heritage.org/border-security/commentary/my-mission-unlock-the-truth-about-harrys-visa-isnt-personal-its-americas">has been obsessed</a> with Harry’s immigrati

<p>Coral Wylie’s play Lavender, Hyacinth, Violet, Yew follows a teenager discovering themselves through horticulture and memories of an old family friend, played by Omari Douglas</p><p>Gardening can be radical, whether a gardener realises it or not. In 2010, fashion designer Ron Finley turned neglected areas in his South Central neighbourhood of Los Angeles into vegetable patches. He was ordered to remove them for gardening without a permit but, with a group of activists, fought back and changed the city’s laws. Derek Jarman’s home in Kent, where he lived in his final years and grew plants in an inhospitable garden, has become a pilgrimage site. Many LGBTQ+ people consider it symbolic of successfully existing in an unwelcoming space, much as Jarman had as a queer man under a Conservative government in the 1980s.</p><p>The transformative power of nature for marginalised communities has a central theme in Lavender, Hyacinth, Violet, Yew, the debut play by nonbinary writer and performer

First thing to overcome is the ick factor in the origin tale of how Dog Man came to have a man’s body and a dog’s head. The story goes that after a bomb explosion critically injures a police officer and his trusty canine sidekick, a nurse decides the only thing for it is to sew the dog’s head on to the officer’s body.</p><p>The resulting supercop is Dog Man, brought to screen in Pilkey’s hand-drawn Sharpie pen style.

<p>The US author’s masterly portrait of a divorced couple brought together by their daughter’s wedding is beautifully observed</p><p>There’s a scene near the end of Anne Tyler’s new novel, <em>Three Days in June, </em>where the two main characters, a divorced middle-aged couple named Gail and Max, compare their lives to the movie <em>Groundhog Day,</em> “where people live through the same day over and over until they get it right”, Gail reminds him. “Wouldn’t it be great if the world worked that way?” says Max. Instead, Tyler’s novels are records of the numerous ways people get things wrong and learn to live with it, and how the wrong things have a sneaky habit, eventually, of turning out to be right.</p><p>Take Gail and Max, who are familiar types from Tyler’s work. She is an orderly worrier, a little abrupt, “right-angled”, who cuts her own hair for fear of the chitchat she gets in the salon. Max, on the other hand, is a big, messy, boundaryless but kind-hearted man who generates “

It’s almost certainly getting a release now here in the UK because its lead, Zoe Saldaña, is up for an Academy Award for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/18/emilia-perez-review-jacques-audiards-gangster-trans-musical-barrels-along-in-style">Emilia Pérez</a> in which, like this one, she plays a Mexican woman.</p><p>Here Saldaña is a strip club employee named Esmee on the run to El Norte after she kills a client, so this at least shows off her range a bit.
