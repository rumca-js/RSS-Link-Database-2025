	Super popular social media influencer Rep. AOC is still in a rage over Elon Musk. The latest reason, besides her inability to calm down, is Musk's attack on USAID. Progressives had been using the government agency as a slush fund to promote their agenda worldwide and use taxpayer dollars to do so. It's an agenda that includes creating Rep. AOC.

This is the case with the <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> teaser trailer.</p><p>Ackshually, yesterday there was the teaser trailer to the teaser trailer. We need to have a national conversation about ending this as a practice. It's a commercial to a commercial to a movie.
