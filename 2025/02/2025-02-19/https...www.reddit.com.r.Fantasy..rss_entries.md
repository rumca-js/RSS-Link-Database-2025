<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve come to realize that what I enjoy about the fantasy genre is rarely the plot involved, as I’ve never been one for violence or war or any of those nasty things in my storytelling, so I’m on the look for something different. </p> <p>I heard a song recently that was pretty and ethereal, used as background music for some random piece of media, but it was very relaxing and mystical, in an enchanted-forest-fairy-princess-esque sort of way. THAT’S the sort of feeling I’m looking for; something so disgustingly wholesome and cloyingly comforting it makes you feel near-ill. Perhaps a good romance with low stakes, or a quiet mystery, as subgenres. So long as they focus on the setting as fantastical.</p> <p>To provide examples, the show and novels Restaurant to Another World are perfect in my eyes, as well as most episodes of the animated show Hilda. I’d had high hopes for Legends and Lattes, but the fantasy was an afterthought rather than the focus, despit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not posting this on <a href="/r/brandonsanderson">r/brandonsanderson</a> for fear of being destroyed but I’ve had it with the past few Sanderson novels. I came up in fantasy LOVING his books - mistborn series 1, the beginning of stormlight archive and most novellas. But good god I got to halfway point of Wind and Truth and just couldn’t do it. Every character interaction felt like a therapy session; and let me say I absolutely believe mental health is super important, but it was all the characters inner monologue and external dialogue discussed. It’s like the actual storyline became so obscure the actual plot of the book took a back seat to each character trying overly hard to showcase it’s okay to not be okay. Which again is a theme I absolutely agree with but I just felt like the book tripped all over itself and never really had much of a story arc. Maybe it’s because I read Sanderson when I was a bit younger but that coupled with the dumb humor an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started Legendborn as an audiobook. I was put off by the 1st person present tense, a combination I generally dislike, but as an audiobook it bothered me less. However, I&#39;m a few chapters in and it&#39;s just complain, complain, complain. I get that she&#39;s not in a good place and all that, but being in her head is not a good time. I&#39;m generally not too fond of reading about her situation, because I have far too much experience with it. However, everyone says this is such a great book, and I normally love fantasy. Though another aspect that&#39;s putting me off is the school stuff. I&#39;m not American and last time I went to school it was another decade. Anyway, my question is, does it get less depressing and more interesting? I&#39;m not in such a good place myself and if it doesn&#39;t get any more positive I don&#39;t think I can continue. It&#39;s been actually my experience with all the hyped books recently, like I DNFed Priory and B

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a fantasy novel, one of my favourites, which I read about 10 years ago. A French novel called <em>La Horde du Contrevent</em> by Alain Damasio (I don&#39;t know, though I hope, if it&#39;s been translated to english). This is such a unique book and it is therefore hard to explain why it works so well. 23 POVs with their unique narration, a worldbuilding based on the very concept of wind, and a journey that is as much physical as metaphorical. </p> <p>Without any pun intended, I was blown away by this story... But then, all these years later, and despite re-reading some of my other fantasy series (Wheel of Time, Realm of the Elderlings, ...), the thought of re-reading it never crossed my mind. As I have grown more mature as a reader, I&#39;m certain I could even more appreciate this journey, so why don&#39;t I want to re-read it? Is it because I&#39;m afraid I couldn&#39;t relive my first experience? Or some books are only meant to be read on

I am looking for books that have already been completed or are &quot;close to completion&quot;. I found a lot of books at home/internet/recommendations, but unfortunately I don&#39;t know which one to start with. So far I have read the Witcher and TOG series, which are worth mentioning, I really liked the world of the witcher, but TOG was also perfectly fine.</p> <p>I was thinking about other maas books, but I heard a lot about them that they went very much in the direction of &quot;romance&quot;, which I have no problem with, but since I&#39;m a man, I might enjoy something with more politics, war, etc.</p> <p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SenpaiSan15"> /u/SenpaiSan15 </a> <br/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What can I say about a book as seminal as The Hobbit that hasn&#39;t already been said? I think in order to fully appreciate a book like this, it is best to detach oneself from the very tropes it helped establish. Read it as if you have no previous notion of wood elves or dwarven mountain kings, or dragons guarding hoards of gold, and you might get a better picture of the story these things create as a whole.</p> <p>In many ways, this book differs quite a bit from many &quot;hero&#39;s journey&quot; storylines. It doesn&#39;t begin with some horrible tragedy where his home is destroyed, it begins in a warm and comfortable home that he is quite content to stay in. He isn&#39;t necessarily motivated by revenge or some noble ambition, but rather for gold. But there is one other thing that ultimately drives Mr Baggins to go on his quest. His mother&#39;s side of the family, the Tooks, were quite inclined to adventures unlike his father&#39;s Mr Baggin&#3
