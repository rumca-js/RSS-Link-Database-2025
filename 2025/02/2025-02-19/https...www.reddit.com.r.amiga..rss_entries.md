<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been recently checking on the number of games being released for the Amiga and I have to say, that for a „dead” platform I was positively surprised. But when I looked deeper I noticed that it’s mostly simple games and/or platformers.</p> <p>It may be that I don’t like platformers and I would enjoy a more complex strategy game. Did I miss any title? </p> <p>Remotely related: did anyone have any success coding for Amiga with LLM models such as Amiga Guru?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/enbewu"> /u/enbewu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1it92qy/modern_gaming_on_the_amiga/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1it92qy/modern_gaming_on_the_amiga/">[comments]</a></span>

## Can’t find Amiga game called Gansey (or so I think)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember this Amiga game being called Gansey. But I can&#39;t find anything like that anywhere. I had a friend around 34 to 32 years ago, and he had an Amiga (I don&#39;t remember more). We used to play almost every day. The game consisted in a single screen platformer, where this kind of penguins / alien penguins or something like that, had to push these for hexagon shaped boxes(Each one at a different symbol inside Like a triangle or a square or an X ) until they formed the pattern indicated in the center top of the screen. There were also some enemies which you could kill by hitting them with the boxes. The bosses consisted very large enemies that would take more than one hit to kill. </p> <p>I don&#39;t know if this is information enough, but it&#39;s all I have.</p> <p>Does anybody remember anything like this?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdeptExit6734"> /u/AdeptExit6734 <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found a copy of a few turrican games but to import cost a couple hundred dollars and I found out it&#39;s easier and cheaper to find the atari st ports of the same games as well. Also I couldn&#39;t find a copy of turrican 2 on the amiga, just the atari st.

## Read/Write Error on All Bootable Disks - Virus?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, When I was a kid, I had an Amiga 500. Last time I was really able to use it was 1997. One day, I found pretty much all my disks would return Read/Write error. It wouldn&#39;t make the grindy disk drive sound, though, like when a disk was damaged. Nothing would boot.</p> <p>Some of my disks were definitely affected by the SCA Virus (&quot;Your Amiga is Alive !!&quot;), but since getting the internet, I learned that it is supposed to pretty much be a harmless virus.</p> <p>Without having a way to test further at the time, I always wondered if this problem which seemed to affect all my disks at once after rebooting from SCA screen, was due to a broken Amiga, or infected disks.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2025, and using Greaze Weazle, I was able to make .adf images of some of my old disks that I still have laying around. When I load them in the emulator... same read/write errors for all of the bootable disks, which is exactly what I experienced back i
