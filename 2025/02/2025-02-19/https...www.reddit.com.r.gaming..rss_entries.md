<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>World War 2 titles seem to be making a comeback but H&amp;D was an awesome game I&#39;d love to see them remake. Imagine authentic, squad-based combat similar to Arma playing as the SAS in WW2. </p> <p>Please give us a campaign though. The older I get the less desire I have for multiplayer. </p> <p>The game was very difficult and made you think. Everything from choosing your soldiers to the entire logistical distribution of supplies among the squad. If you didn&#39;t equip SMGs or bolt actions your soldiers would literally have no primary weapons. </p> <p>I think you were limited to four men per mission and if they died that was the end of them. The first WW2 game I&#39;ve ever seen to have a motorcycle and sidecar with the MG42. Absolutely badass. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gilette_bayonete"> /u/gilette_bayonete </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1it3p5p/hid

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im currently playing Evil West and the combat in this game is some of the most fun in a while. The escalation of difficulty is perfect IMO. Nothing like going from power fantasy slammerfest to getting your ass handed to you by a new &quot;sub boss&quot; that just becomes a new common enemy down the road. Genuinely some of the most fun I&#39;ve had with a combat centric game in a long time. Only things I can compare it to off the top of my head is Devil May Cry series and the newer God Of War.
