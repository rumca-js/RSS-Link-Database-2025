Basically, I want something with tons of cozy, feel-good moments and a happy ending where the couple gets together for sure. No heartbreaks or bittersweet vibes, just pure, adorable love. Bonus points if it‚Äôs a fantasy or has some light action in it. Any recommendations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Equinox_045"> /u/Equinox_045 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1issn0l/looking_for_good_romance_anime/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1issn0l/looking_for_good_romance_anime/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always watched anime casually but I want to be able to watch something with my wife. Preferably Romance/Slice of life with a dub and without all the &quot;fan service&quot;. The only thing she&#39;s seen and actually like was the movie &quot;Your Name.&quot; Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hollywood5333"> /u/Hollywood5333 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1issh47/recommendations_for_my_wife/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1issh47/recommendations_for_my_wife/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got bored of regular slice of life anime with the same plot trope and eveything so i wanted to watch anything with a unpopular trope to it like tsundere x tsundere maybe (ranma excluded due to how popular its been) but the show is much funnier when it feel like the power goes all to a single person in the relationship so i&#39;d rather if someone recommend something like that. Does anyone have literally ANYTHING like that? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Expert_Alarm_3108"> /u/Expert_Alarm_3108 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1isrlaa/looking_for_any_unpopularunderrated_trope_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1isrlaa/looking_for_any_unpopularunderrated_trope_in/">[comments]</a></span>
