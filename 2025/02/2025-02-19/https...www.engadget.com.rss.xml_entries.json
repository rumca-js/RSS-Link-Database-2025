This led to folks getting suspended as these smaller infractions piled up.</p>\n<p>The platform says that most minor infractions, like cheating in an online game, will expire after 90 days. More serious violations, like participating in hateful conduct, will remain on an account for one to two years. The worst behavior will still result in an immediate suspension.
