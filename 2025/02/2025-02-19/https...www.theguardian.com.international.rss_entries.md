<p>Despite being freewheelin’ with the facts, this Bob Dylan biopic has delighted fans old and new, with Timothée Chalamet proving more than just a Zimmerman mimic</p><p>So how <em>did</em> it feel? Bob Dylan’s early years in New York have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/16/highereducation.biography">chronicled</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/21/drama">dramatised</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/23/inside-llewyn-davis-review">riffed on</a> and pored over more than the Last Supper. James Mangold’s biopic – told very much with the backing, though not the guiding hand of Dylan Inc – somehow achieved the impossible: keeping the people with working knowledge of the musical rota at the Gaslight Cafe as interested as those with little more than an acquaintance with TikTok covers of Blowin’ in the Wind.</p><p>And that’s perhaps the key case for A Complete Unknown to win the best picture Oscar.

<p>The soul singer is releasing his first album in nearly 20 years and looks back on a career full of major highs and devastating lows</p><p>For more than 60 years, Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers has made his living singing blue-eyed soul. But now, at 84, he feels the best way to express himself is by going hardcore country.</p><p>On his first new album in nearly 20 years, Straight from the Heart, Medley devoted every track to melancholy ballads made famous by country stars such as Kris Kristofferson, Hank Williams and George Jones. “I feel I can sing these songs, because I’ve lived these songs,” Medley said. “When you get older, you’ve seen a lot of ups and downs. And I’ve had some real downs.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/19/the-righteous-brothers-bill-medley-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A deep dive into the world of making things that means you’ll never look at your kettle in quite the same way again</p><p>It’s some measure of the extent of urbanisation that the bookends to our day may not be birdsong but the&nbsp;sound of a kettle as the water in it reaches boiling point. That “tock” is made by a miniature device, a small disc consisting of alternating strips of two different metals. When exposed to&nbsp;heat, the metals expand at different rates, the disc gradually curves, and a switch is tripped, cutting off electricity to the kettle. Few of us know this; we&nbsp;write odes to nightingales, not thermostats, even though it is the latter that provides our morning soundtrack, those sonic notches that mark the passing of each day. Tock, tock, tock.</p><p>I thought little about those metallic notes until I read Tim Minshall’s new book, an ambitious exploration of the world of manufacturing. In it, he examines the myriad things that surround us, from transistors to

<p>From the psychological torture to the inexorable rightward drift of the family business, it’s not much fun being a Murdoch</p><p>It is a life-defining moment, for James Murdoch, to describe his father and wider family in an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/04/rupert-murdoch-family-succession-james-murdoch/681675/">interview with the Atlantic</a>. Much of the rough and tumble and backstabbing – Rupert essentially pitting James against the older Lachlan, in a fight that continually vexed him because his favourite (Lachlan) never won – has existed in the public domain for years as rumour.

<p>A fast, no-frills pleasure, with every bite a riot of crunch, tang, heat and umami</p><p>I love pantry-raid meals. Even when the fridge is shockingly bare, an enticing meal still sits at your fingertips, so long as you have the right ingredients to hand in your cupboards. This sriracha mayo twist on the fish finger sandwich is a 10/10 “pantry raider”. The Kewpie mayonnaise brings umami oomph, with the crunch of fish fingers, the tang of cornichons and the warmth of sriracha and chilli against soft, crustless bread. Warning: if there’s any sriracha mayo left over, you may lick the bowl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/19/fish-finger-sriracha-mayo-sandwich-recipe-lara-lee">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emotions hide beneath the surface and horrors lurk behind unseen doors in Walter Salles’s Oscar-nominated tale of the Brazilian disappeared</p><p>The subtlety and dignity of Fernanda Torres’s Oscar-nominated performance in Walter Salles’s new film have been rightly praised. This is a kind of mother-courage true story: the case of Eunice Paiva, a Brazilian woman who had to keep her family together and shield her five children from despair when her activist husband Rubens was brutally “disappeared” in 1971 by the military dictatorship. They refused even to admit he had been arrested, or later officially admit his death, in a state-sanctioned act of cruelty which was only finally acknowledged in the mid-90s after decades of campaigning, when the government issued a formal death certificate.</p><p>I’m Still Here is a drama which intelligently seeks to intuit the courageously maintained calm that Eunice imposes on herself and the children when the thuggish secret police arrive.
