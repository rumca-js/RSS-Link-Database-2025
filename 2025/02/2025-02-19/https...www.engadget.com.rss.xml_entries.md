<p>Attention audiophiles: the archive of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop is being made available to the public for the first name. This department was founded in the 1950s as a laboratory that could invent original music and sound effects for BBC radio, and later television, programming. Over the years, its roster of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-08-13-kraftwerk-who-pioneering-50s-synthesizer-unearthed-in-french.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/2011-08-13-kraftwerk-who-pioneering-50s-synthesizer-unearthed-in-french.html">innovative</a> musicians and composers created audio for iconic BBC productions of the 1950s and 1960s such as <em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the <em>Goon Show</em> and <em>Blake's 7</em>. In addition to developing those signature sounds, members' work also laid early foundations for creating electronic music and sampling. I

<p>The second season of <em>The Last of Us</em> now has a firm premiere date. HBO has announced that its adaptation of Naughty Dog&#39;s games will hit the network and Max on April 13. &quot;Five years after the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie are drawn into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind,&quot; HBO said in a press release.

<p>“Which iPhone should I buy?” It’s a question you might have heard many times over the years. Much of the time, the answer is simple: Get the best iPhone you can afford. If you’re happy with your current iPhone, meanwhile, don’t feel like you have to make a change at all. But if you’re ready to upgrade, allow us to help. We’ve reviewed just about every iPhone ever released, so we’ve picked through all nine models in Apple’s current smartphone lineup and highlighted the ones that should satisfy most people below.<br><br>Before we dive in, note that we’ve based our guide on the MSRPs of new, unlocked iPhones on Apple.com. If you can find a heavy discount from another trusted retailer or a good deal on a refurbished model, that could always change the value equation. With that disclaimer out of the way, here are the best iPhones you can buy as of early 2025.<br><br><strong>Editor’s Note (2/19/25):</strong> Apple just announced the newest and most affordable iPhone, the <a data-i13n="c

<p>Twitch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US">has rolled out a number of changes</a> to its violation enforcement system. The biggest change is that now infractions will disappear from an account “after a set amount of time.” This is great news for long-time creators, as minor violations stacked. This led to folks getting suspended as these smaller infractions piled up.</p>
<p>The platform says that most minor infractions, like cheating in an online game, will expire after 90 days. More serious violations, like participating in hateful conduct, will remain on an account for one to two years. The worst behavior will still result in an immediate suspension. Also, if a user is indefinitely suspended due to the accumulation of multiple violations, they can apply for reinstatement after six months.</p>

The company tried to <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/humane-shows-off-its-futuristic-ai-pin-wearable-113510130.html">build some buzz</a> around its AI Pin in late 2023, marketing the device as a tiny replacement for smartphones and playing up the fact that Humane’s co-founders were former Apple employees. The problem was that it wasn’t really clear what the AI Pin would do to justify its $700 asking price (plus a $24/month subscription).</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for things to spiral out of control. The AI Pin was released in April of 2024 to some of the worst reviews I’ve ever seen for a consumer tech product.

But since Apple Intelligence has up till today only been available on the iPhone 16 series (and just the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max before that), there hasn't been a sub-$600 iPhone that can run the latest suite of tools. So the addition of the $599 iPhone 16e to Apple's lineup isn't surprising.</p>

<p>First up, there’s music-sharing. The update lets users share tunes in both one-on-one messages and group chats. Just open up the sticker tray and tap on the “Music” option. This will open up a search bar of Instagram&#39;s audio library. There are a couple of caveats here. The song has to be available via Instagram and clips are maxed out at 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Google is <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/google-lens/lens-on-ios-ai-overviews/">introducing</a> two small but meaningful enhancements to its Lens technology. To start, Chrome and Google app users on iPhone can now draw, highlight or tap on text and images to carry out a visual search of what they see in front of them. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Google is basically bringing over an interface paradigm it debuted last year with <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-s24-and-pixel-8-owners-can-soon-search-for-anything-by-drawing-a-circle-around-it-180029757.html">Circle to Search on Android</a> to iPhone. While the implementation is different and more limited due to the constraints of iOS, the idea is the same: Google wants to save you the trouble of opening a new Chrome tab or saving a screenshot when you want to find more information about an image you see.</p>

<p>World models — AI algorithms capable of generating simulated environments — represent one forefront of machine learning. Today, Microsoft published new research in the journal <em>Nature</em> detailing Muse, a model capable of generating game visuals and controller inputs. Unexpectedly, it was born out of a training set Microsoft built from <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-09-ninja-theorys-bleeding-edge-is-4-on-4-melee-madness.html"><em>Bleeding Edge</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://aka.ms/MSQuantumAQBlog">introduced</a> Majorana 1, a chip for <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-may-have-finally-made-quantum-computing-useful-164501302.html">quantum computing</a>, which it said will enable computers to solve incredibly difficult industrial-scale problems in mere years instead of the decades current machines need. The company explained that Majorana 1 is the first quantum computing chip that uses a Topological Core architecture. Specifically, it uses a new type of material called a topoconductor or a topological superconductor that can create <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/73/6/44/909657/Majorana-qubits-for-topological-quantum">Majoranas</a> — a state of matter that's not a solid, a liquid or a gas.</p>

<p>Despite the obvious benefits of electric cars, Toyota spent the last decade insisting <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-hydrogen-fuel-cell-toyota-mirai-evs.html">hydrogen</a> would win out in the end. But, as the company <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://media.toyota.co.uk/toyota-develops-new-fuel-cell-system-contributing-towards-a-future-hydrogen-society/">announces its third generation fuel cell system</a>, you can tell it’s finally ready to tacitly admit defeat: the new cell is designed for industrial applications, where hydrogen clearly always made more sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new cell is designed to meet the “particular needs of the commercial sector,” focusing on durability equal to a diesel engine. It’s a lot more fuel efficient, cheaper to make and outputs twice as much power while sitting in the same footprint as the second-generation model. Given Toyota’s love of shrinking its engine technology, that size wasn’t a factor here i

<p>It's honestly difficult to remember the simpler days of video card shopping, before crypto fanatics, supply chain issues and pandemic demand pushed GPUs far beyond rising manufacturer prices.
