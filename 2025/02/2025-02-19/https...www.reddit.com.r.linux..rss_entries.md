It allows Void Linux users to easily install and run this kernel on their systems. Following the mainline kernel, it has just been updated to version 6.13.3 today.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Seriously, I came mostly for privacy reasons and will now stay because Linux made using a PC fun again. In a way using Linux is like back then when PCs where new and, for the most part, something creative. Where Windows kept evolving and everything was new and exciting. Linux, probably due to its open source nature, still feels exactly like that. Tons of ways to use it, tons of distros, you can tinker with it however you want to. It obviously has flaws when all you know is Windows where most things work out of the box but the gained freedom is just worth SO much more. In a way the same applies to everything FOSS. If there is one thing I grew tired of in todays digital world its how utterly corporate and sanitized everything is. Everything needs to be as foolproof as possible, everything needs to be as inoffensive as possible and because of that you get told what youre allowed to do. Linux and the whole FOSS community is the exact opposite. You actual

As well as the gestures themselves, for example, in Gnome when the tap to click function in gnome is active, the review gesture with 3 fingers is almost impossible to call, it thinks that this is a click, not a gesture. This does not depend on the distribution, I have tried all the popular ones. The problem is not even in DE because in addition to Gnome and KDE I have tried window managers such as dwm, hiprland, i3, bspwm, everything is the same. What&#39;s interesting is that I connected my PS5 joystick, which has a touchpad, and the cursor control is very responsive, just like it was perfect on Windows. Should I swit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a Linux user since 2014, my first experience in Linux was with Unity on Ubuntu 12.10 a few years before but I went back to XP since it ran very slowly and was completely alien. lol After that I used MATE pretty steadily on Fedora Linux (and then Ubuntu when I got sick of fighting Fedora to get printer drivers to work and other annoyances) until January of this year. I briefly tried Gnome 3, Cinnamon, KDE and some others but I found that MATE worked best for me. In January I switched to Mint since it&#39;s been a long time since I tried it last and I&#39;m actually loving it so far. But it&#39;s made me think, Gnome is supposedly the most popular and it&#39;s offered on a lot of distros as the default but I&#39;ve never seen anyone actually use it as their daily. lol</p> <p>(Side question but multiple work space switching was a thing I also heard people using years ago, Commodore OS even made a showy 3D cube animation for switching work

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With 6.14 coming in March, I&#39;m wondering how we can take advantage of NPUs on Linux. Anyone have examples?</p> <p>The new Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is coming out that has MASSIVE performance improvements for an APU. A real contendor for portable llm workflows at the client level. As someone that travels a lot I&#39;m considering that new asus laptop for that power and massive chip. It&#39;s not exactly an M1, but the ability to add ram to the gpu is really cool.</p> <p>According to AMD&#39;s site, only windows is supported: <a href="https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html">https://ryzenai.docs.amd.com/en/latest/inst.html</a></p> <p>So what use is an NPU (for which we have a driver in the 6.14 kernel) if there&#39;s no api and software to utilize it?</p> <p>I&#39;m VERY new to this, and so please understand of it sounds like I&#39;m coming from a very ignorant place, lol.</p> <p>P.S. I&#39;m against the use of all this close-sourced &quot;ai&quot
