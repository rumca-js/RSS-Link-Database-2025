Both have Google elements. What would be the best time to degoogle? </p> <p>I could remove everything possible on the 24+ beforehand. But if I import info from the 21+, would google import, too? I assume yes.</p> <p>What if I cleaned out the 24+ then had the phone number changed, and entered info manually rather than just import everything across the board?</p> <p>Or perhaps there&#39;s another option?

For instance, I&#39;ve removed most of Google&#39;s access to sites as a sign in method. Also, I&#39;m using a non gmail address and aliases to log in to sites that I visit frequently. </p> <p>According to BitWarden I have about 400 site specific accounts I&#39;ve created over the years, the vast majority with my gmail address as a login. So if I bought something from an online storefront, I probably created an account with <a href=\"mailto:myaddress@gmail.com\">myaddress@gmail.com</a> as a login. </p> <p>My question: is it worth it to delete all these accounts? In some cases it&#39;s easy to do so - Zillow has a delete account option. But it&#39;s time consuming, especially when I have to submit a request to AlsUsedPoodles.com for an account deletion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/plasticdispl",
