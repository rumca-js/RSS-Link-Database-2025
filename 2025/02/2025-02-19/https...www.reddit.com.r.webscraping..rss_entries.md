<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, thank you for reading, I&#39;ll be short. I am trying to Webscrap the my local sheriffs arrest records as they are populated and before the whole record is released in attempt to solicit my bail bonding company first before others. Anyone have any experience on how this is possible? I can easily see the arrest records after posting but I am trying to be on the scene just after the arrest is booked.</p> <p>Robert</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Significant-Tap-9777"> /u/Significant-Tap-9777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1itgo3t/webscrape_for_bail_bonds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1itgo3t/webscrape_for_bail_bonds/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>ok apologize in advance if this is the wrong sub and/or if this is a stupid question but maybe someone can help point me in the right direction or at least what to call what I&#39;m looking for....</p> <p>I own a small local service business and one of our competitors (much larger company) has a page on their website where you type in your address (no other account/name etc. info required) and it tells you if they provided service to the address and the exact date of the last service and service provided. I&#39;m wondering if it is possible to search multiple addresses like for whole towns, and see the results to show all of the houses in a specific town who have a last service date from the competitor. Is this possible and is this called webscraping? is it complicated or something someone could figure out how to do? any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tradition
