        "description": "<p>The universe needs more grimdark novellas, and Z.B. Steele delivers in spades with An Inkling of Flame. Although the novella can be read as a standalone volume, it also serves as a gateway to the author\u2019s A Song of the Damned series. An Inkling of Flame tells the story of Layne, a soldier conscripted to fight in service of a deity known as the Fox. The influence of Anna Smith Spark runs deep throughout An Inkling of Flame, especially in the latter part of the novella. One of the main characters is even named after our beloved Queen of Grimdark. Like much of Anna Smith Spark\u2019s work, An Inkling of Flame takes the perspective of everyday soldiers as they are forced to fight in someone else\u2019s war. A particular highlight of the novella is the camaraderie that forms among Layne and his fellow soldiers, which lends a comforting found family feel to this grimdark world. An Inkling of Flame is a very well written novella, with carefully polished prose that delivers grimdark grit interspers",
