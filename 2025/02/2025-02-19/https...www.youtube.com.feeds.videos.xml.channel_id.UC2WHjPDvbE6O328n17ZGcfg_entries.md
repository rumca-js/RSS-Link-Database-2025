Check out Ktor: https://kotl.in/try-ktor-3

I've never used Kotlin or Ktor until today, so I decided to build a reverse proxy for docker to learn all about it. I'll be able to utilize Ktor's coroutines for handling async requests, built-in HTTP client for forwarding traffic, routing to dynamically proxy requests to different backend services, and things like that. But first, I wanted to get acquainted with Kotlin, so I did Kotlin Koans, which is “one of the most popular and most effective ways to get into Kotlin for people who already know Java.” And that it was.

This was a fun project to build, so I hope you enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it!
