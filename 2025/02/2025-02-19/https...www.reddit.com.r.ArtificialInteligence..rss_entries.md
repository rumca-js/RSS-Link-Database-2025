<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently followed some news regarding character ai and found out that now, even a 13-year-old can use it without any issues.</p> <p>My take: If you let kids use a platform that&#39;s so unrestricted, they are easily influenced and exposed to content that&#39;s not suitable for them, especially nsfw material.</p> <p>Not every parent can control what their kid sees, and eventually, every kid will stumble upon NSFW content. I&#39;ve seen instances where bots reply with messages encouraging self-harm, suicide, or violence toward others, which is extremely harmful content for minors to be exposed to.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t good for anyone involved; it harms both the platform and the kids using it, and it sets a dangerous precedent. I hope that other uncensored chatbots like janitor, spicy chat, and secret desires ai don&#39;t follow suit and start catering to children, as it would become a new normal that I believe is detrimental to our future.</p> </div

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>System II thinking is a term coined by Daniel Kahneman to distinguish deliberate, step-by-step logical thinking from intuitive (System I) thought. Currently many LLMs are implementing System II features by allowing the LLM to produce intermediate output before it delivers its final response to a prompt. The LLM generates output, which is appended to the original prompt. There can be multiple passes, each adding output, which deliberates on what has already been produced. These passes can check proposed solutions, criticise, or suggest different directions, resulting in a better quality final answer.<br/> Currently, the intermediate results are produced in human language. However, I have heard that where Reinforcement Learning was used to allow the LLM to learn reasoning with reduced human input, there have been cases of the LLM reasoning in different languages to the original prompt, or using made-up tokens.</p> <p>I think it is likely that greater u
