Benchmarking includes gaming performance tests of the best video cards in 2025, some revisits of older cards like the RTX 3070 and GTX 1070, and power consumption and efficiency tests. The GPU market is in an era of absurdity now, reminiscent of 2020. Price means nothing.\n\nWatch our Fake Prices video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s4hxa2TjWY\nWatch our Paper Launch video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMd2WHKnceI\n\nGrab our GN15 Modmat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\nOr our Silicone Soldering & Project Mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-project-soldering-mat\n\nLike our content?
