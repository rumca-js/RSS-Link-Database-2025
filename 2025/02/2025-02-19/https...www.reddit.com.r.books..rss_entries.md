<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt&#39;s Darkest Journey by Candice Millard is an account of Roosevelt&#39;s expedition down an uncharted Amazon tributary in 1914. This well-written book reads like an adventure story, serving as a character study of Roosevelt and a window into early 20th-century attitudes and exploration. Millard&#39;s approach neither glorifies nor condemns Roosevelt&#39;s actions but presents them without bias, which I always appreciate in non-fiction books.</p> <p>One of the more poignant and thought-provoking personality contrasts was Roosevelt&#39;s repugnance at his Brazilian co- commander&#39;s insistence upon returning for a lost murderer so that he could later be hanged at a time when they all felt they would surely die of starvation, and the equal repugnance of that same commander when Roosevelt later insisted they stop and search for a lost beloved dog.</p> <p>Even though we know how the story ends, the details of the

Or maybe just define them. Or maybe they’re just old enough that they seem that way. </p> <p>I’m thinking of stories like Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, or Beowulf, or Journey to the West, or the Bible (at least the first few books in it like Genesis and Exodus), or even stories that don’t really have original definitive versions like Robin Hood. </p> <p>What else could fit that mold? Gilgamesh? Or would the fact that the Gilgamesh stories basically vanished for a few millennia before being rediscovered in the 19th century remove it from a list like that? </p> <p>Are there more modern stories that approach this sort of importance? Shakespeare or Grimm’s Fairy Tales? </p> <p>And, maybe I should consider if this is even an important classification to consider at all. If the criteria is the overall impact on society

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I picked up this book initially because I heard it inspired a lot of Sam Lake&#39;s writing in certain video games like Control, and Alan Wake 2.</p> <p>Initially I wasn&#39;t really intrigued with the idea of the book being non-linear, and having to put effort into flipping through the book. But the more I read it, I enjoyed these aspects to a degree. It&#39;s surprisingly scary (but not OMG I am shaking and crying scary) considering I don&#39;t get easily spooked. There is something insanely terrifying about getting lost in labyrinth, especially one that decides to change at will. I also really enjoy the footnotes, which are sometimes hilarious and cheeky.</p> <p>I think the story is far is engaging, I &quot;get&quot; the book. I&#39;m near page 100, read every single deviation in full (like the Whalestoe letters, and I even read chapter XIII when prompted), but for the past few days I basically haven&#39;t touched the book despite enjoying it.</p>

Joseph Marshall is a Lakota writer and I believe university teacher that writers primarily about various aspects of Lakota culture or history. His book &quot;Keep going&quot; (highly recommended, albeit short - not available digitally) for instance is a celebration of keeping up the fight even when things are hard told in the manner of a man being lost after the death of his father and going to see his grandfather for advice.</p> <p>Now to Lakota Westerns. I&#39;ve attempted this several times before, but never made it through the first book, but I completed both now. The Lakota Western is a duology of historical novels telling part of the story of westward expansion from the perspective of the Lakota, culminating with the death of Crazy Horse. It is a fantastic duology that showcases the culture of the Lakota, phenomenally written characters (all of which I assume did actually exist due to the nature of the work

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I live in rural Oklahoma and love reading horror. Unfortunately both my local library and the Libby system I have access to is lacking in that department. I browse other libraries (like Los Angeles) on libby to occasionally see what I&#39;m missing out on. </p> <p>I was wondering if there were any large library systems that allow non residents to get library cards (even if you need to pay) to access more robust catalogs? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gaelfling"> /u/Gaelfling </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1isw7eb/libraries_that_offer_non_residents_cards_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1isw7eb/libraries_that_offer_non_residents_cards_to/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished Dark Matter on Apple Tv and even though I didn&#39;t want to, I&#39;m so glad I did. Dark Matter is one of my favorite books of all time and I&#39;m typically disappointed with movies because you can never glean as much from a movie (which is why I waited so long to watch it). However, it was excellent and I swear the movie brought to life the settings that I had concocted in my own mind when I read it. And even though I had read the book, there was enough deviation that it kept it interesting for me and didn&#39;t make me mad like deviations typically do. Some of my other all time fave books that I felt brought to life my minds eye was Goldfinch and Alien. Can anyone recommend any other excellent books that will be a good movie watch? I just read Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but haven&#39;t watched it yet, though I read on here it was a good adaptation. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com
