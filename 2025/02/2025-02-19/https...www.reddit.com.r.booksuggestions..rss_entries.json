I specifically want books from Ecuador because that is where my mum is originally from, and I feel like that would help me learn the ``correct`` spanish, plus it would give me more cultrual refrences if you guys know what I mean. I have read a lot of different books but my current favorite books right now are Demian by Herman Hesse, The midnight library by Matt Haig, and I am now reading Breast and eggs by Mieko Kawakami. Does anyone know any books that might be similar by authors from Ecuador or maybe even from latin america. Or if you guys know any books that might help with learning spanish (latin american spanish specifically), I would appreciate that. I apologise for my english or if anything is written weirdly.

After some research, I found a few books that seem like great starting points:</p> <ol> <li><p>The Daily Stoic \u2013 Ryan Holiday &amp; Stephen Hanselman.</p></li> <li><p>How to Be a Stoic \u2013 Massimo Pigliucci.</p></li> <li><p>Meditations \u2013 Marcus Aurelius (Gregory Hays translation).</p></li> <li><p>The Obstacle Is the Way \u2013 Ryan Holiday.</p></li> </ol> <p>I\u2019m looking for a book that introduces Stoicism in a way that\u2019s practical, beginner-friendly, but also deep enough to be meaningful. Do you think these books are a good starting point? Are there any other books that really helped you understand and apply Stoic principles in your life?</p> <p>Would love to hear your recommendations and experiences!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible",

I&#39;m looking for anything else in the same vein.</p> <p>Basically this sorcerer arrives at this school of pages, naturally our protagonist is more lifted than the other students. Comes to find out he is destined to bring an end to Light and issue in an Age of Dark. Not everything is so black and white, Light is not inherently good, Dark is not inherently evil. Demons are not inherently cruel and God&#39;s are not inherently righteous.</p> <p>Does our protagonist fight against fate or does he succumb to his destiny? All of this made the series so good. The first book built up to this awesome reveal of his destiny, the second book was his downfall and the 3rd is his redemption arc. It was so good and I need more like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jehrok9\"> /u/jehrok9 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ww",

I\u2019ve never been good at committing to reading as a leisurely hobby, and I\u2019m determined to change that. </p> <p>In 2025 I\u2019m hoping to read at least 6 books (child\u2019s play to most of you, I\u2019m sure), but I want to give myself a realistic goal that will set me up to stick with it. </p> <p>My first book down of 2025 was Project Hail Mary which I loved. It struck the perfect notes of lighthearted, funny, quirky, wholesome and adventure for me, and I\u2019m definitely a sucker for space exploration themed stories. </p> <p>I\u2019m not afraid to admit that my reading comprehension and overall attention span when reading are rusty at best, so I ask that you keep that in mind. </p> <p>That being said, do any good recommendations come to mind? PHM was right up my alley and I\u2019d love some reccos that fit that bill in some shape or form. Definitely does not need to be space or sci-fi, but just overall",

So naturally I am looking for some recommendations for physical editions of the books, the chunkier the better as well.</p> <p>I do enjoy a good murder mystery and detective books. Ideally looking for something similar to Dan brown/Sherlock Holmes/agatha Christie like detectives or for murder books similar to a good girl&#39;s guide to murder/how to kill your family/how to kill men and get away with it. I have previously also enjoyed the works of seishi yokomizo and s.j Cullen, but they are more Japan orientated murders/detectives.</p> <p>Horror i am fairly picky, but my go to&#39;s are usually Stephen king, dean koontz or Lovecraft, so looking for something similar. I am okay with gore or very graphical descriptions.</p> <p>For fantasy or historical romance i am also fairly picky. I enjoy well written romance and the few I have tried I find they are more about",

I also generally see this in fanfiction where the main character is a child who was reborn with memories intact from a previous life and has issues with authority and a past/ knowledge of the character/ story they got reborn into that makes them feel like letting parents, the government, or just adults in general be in charge of their life is a bad idea. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen any normal published books like that though. I would love to see one where the MC is just a child prodigy or something and is making the same struggles without it being fanfiction or reincarnation. I guess the closest I could think of is Ender&#39;s Game but that isn&#39;t quite right and it is more of adults expecting too much from a child and using him as a sacrifice for the greater good. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Isekai_litrpg\"> /u",

I recently reread &quot;If You&#39;re In My Office, It&#39;s Already Too Late&quot; by James Sexton, and It&#39;s currently the gold standard for me as far as relationship and self-help books. </p> <p>This is not a review, but If you haven&#39;t read it, I like it because the author is a divorce attorney. Rather than following the protocol for advice books, he wrote a guide on how NOT to fuck up the relationship based on his experiences. I found it engaging, funny, and truly insightful. It&#39;s filled with anecdotes that grab my attention.</p> <p>I realize a billion people have asked similar questions, but I&#39;m specifically looking for something likewise distinct; a twist on the classic &quot;how to&quot; book that offers wisdom and perspective without becoming preachy or boring. Specifically something available on Audible, since I &quot;read&quot; a lot at work. Thanks! </p> </",

I&#39;m not well versed in genres/subgenres at all, but I liked this description of realist writing I found on here while googling around-</p> <p>&quot;As far as I can tell, the defining characteristic of realist literature is that the text is meant to provide revelation rather than resolution, which is to say that the plot is not the main point, but serves instead as a vehicle for conveyance of meaning through systems of symbols and indexical relations.&quot;</p> <p>That&#39;s a pretty good description of what I&#39;m looking for, though the whole &quot;conveyance of meaning through systems of symbols&quot; sounds to me like it might be describing something that would be too allegorical for my tastes.
