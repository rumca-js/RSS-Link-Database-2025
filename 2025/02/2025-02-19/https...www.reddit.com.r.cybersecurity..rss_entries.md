<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We run Crowdstrike Falcon on our endpoints, but I&#39;ve been testing rolling out MSRT to those endpoints also, and automating a full MSRT scan once/week on every endpoint. This would be supplemental protection and from my tests it doesn&#39;t interfere with crowdstrike.</p> <p>Does anyone have any experience running multiple EDR&#39;s on their endpoints? Thank you in advance for your help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hyper_and_untenable"> /u/hyper_and_untenable </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1isrs5u/msrt_in_addition_to_crowdstrike/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1isrs5u/msrt_in_addition_to_crowdstrike/">[comments]</a></span>
