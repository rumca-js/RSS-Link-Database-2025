<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something caught my eye in the AheadComputing blog / press release two weeks ago, which I forgot about for a bit, and I haven&#39;t seen remarked on anywhere:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the microcontroller market, ARM is encountering significant competition from the RISC-V ecosystem. This market is characterized by low margins and costs but operates at very high volumes. The RISC-V architecture, with its royalty-free instruction set, has captured a substantial portion of the microcontroller market from ARM. <strong>ARM has essentially conceded, as they are no longer intending to create new microcontrollers</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>What? Really? Has anyone else seen anything along those lines?</p> <p><a href="https://www.aheadcomputing.com/post/a-seismic-shift-in-the-computing-ecosystem-brings-opportunity">https://www.aheadcomputing.com/post/a-seismic-shift-in-the-computing-ecosystem-brings-opportunity</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by
