Last year when we attended I was pregnant and although knackered, I was determined to enjoy it as we thought it would be our last visit for a while. But whist there we saw quite a few other families with prams, so wondered if maybe it was possible... I was wondering if anyone here has attended UKGE (or I suppose any game convention) with an under 1 year old, what their experience was, any tips for doing so, and wether or not with hindsight they would do it again? Our child will be 7 months at the time of this year&#39;s expo. If we do go, we would attend the slightly quieter Friday only, but interested to know other people&#39;s thoughts and experiences before making a decision.

Even though it was a solid game, my tastes and the groups I played with at the time caused it to not get tabled a lot. Setup, round maintenance and teardown were also an issue (which I discovered can be solved by getting a couple of bags to draw tiles from).</p> <p>I&#39;m now looking into reacquiring it. While looking into it, I saw that the previous version had player reference component as <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5036378\">part of the player sheets themselves</a>. And even though it seems bland, it does seem more visually cohesive than the 2019. version, which is bordering eyesore. On the other hand, I reckon that 2019. version has more content in it, and is definitely easier to get on the market.</p> <p>If you were to get CoB today, would you rather get anniversary edition or the older one? I&#39;m not interested in deluxe edition.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
