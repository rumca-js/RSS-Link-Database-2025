<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made the mistake of getting 2 providers using the same backbone. 1 has now expired, and the other will be up in a few days.</p> <p>This allows me to rethink what servers to use. I do lots of downloading and having 2 servers is a must. What 2 should I look at? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InternalOcelot2855"> /u/InternalOcelot2855 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1it9vv6/servers_expired_what_2_to_look_at/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1it9vv6/servers_expired_what_2_to_look_at/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like so many of you, I’m looking back into Usenet after many years away. I’ve been gone over 10 years, and I’ve forgotten a lot lol. I’m trying to go auto download for shows I want mainly. And just to be able to browse through groups and find things I might like in TV, movies, books, etc. I currently use a Mac this time around, which is definitely limiting what software I can use to accomplish this. Can anyone with a current Mac setup please let me know what combo of client, server, and other software you are using to accomplish this? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yankeejohn"> /u/yankeejohn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1it3w50/setting_up_on_a_mac/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1it3w50/setting_up_on_a_mac/">[comments]</a></span>

## Is it just me, or has Usenet.Farm become mostly useless?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Followup to my post here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9w7ou/usenet_for_discussions_in_2025/">https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9w7ou/usenet_for_discussions_in_2025/</a></p> <p>I&#39;ve gotten an Eternal September account now and actually have it up and running. My initial feeling is a bit … sad … honestly. I checked out some of the old <strong>alt.fan.\</strong>* groups I was a member of 25 years ago. I didn&#39;t expect them to be active, but I was hoping the discussions might be archived. (Then again, maybe it&#39;s better I can&#39;t see what 13-year-old me was saying.)</p> <p>As it is, I&#39;m going to set aside some time to actually browse through the list of active groups and look for some to join. I&#39;ve already found a few that I&#39;m not surprised are still active -- Apple II and Ham Radio fans would absolutely never leave Usenet. :)</p> <p>Thanks again for all the advice helping me get started.</p> </div>

## 2.0 of the indexer we don't speak of. How do I recover my account?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Visiting my favorite indexer for the first time in many months, I was directed to a new login page touting site-we-don&#39;t-speak-of 2.0. This is a site that I&#39;ve poured donations into over the years, yet I was never smart enough to have a real email tied to it. The 2.0 version requests an email at login, as opposed to the username of the old 1.0 site. Is anyone aware of how to potentially access the site with my previous login? Am I at a complete loss? This would be devastating to me, though I recognize my own faults here. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KnickStoveMaleDasha"> /u/KnickStoveMaleDasha </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1isvs63/20_of_the_indexer_we_dont_speak_of_how_do_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1isvs63/20_of_the_indexer_we_dont_speak_of_how_do_i/">[comments]</a></span>
