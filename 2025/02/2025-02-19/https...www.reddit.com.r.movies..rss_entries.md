## Anyone think "Jingle all the Way" with Arnold Schwarzeneggar feels like a Simpsons episode in live-action?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just rewatched the movie and the whole thing reminded me of a live-action Simpsons episode. Swap Arnold for Homer Simpson looking for the favorite toy for Christmas at the last-minute and that&#39;s what it is. But also the humor/comedy of the movie felt exactly like Simpsons in the late 90&#39;s (when the movie came out).</p> <p>They have the santas singing only for Arnold to punch them all out, the neighbor is literally a more annoying version of Ned Flanders, you have Arnold rushing through the mall crashing into customers looking for toys getting beaten up by women calling him a pervert, you have the older police officer on the motorcycle who Arnold keeps crashing into and getting into trouble with, etc. Then you have Sinbad&#39;s role and everything else. It&#39;s just literally a live-action Simpsons episode.</p> <p>(also props to Jake Lloyd here for his movie role right before The Phantom Menace only 2 years later)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3

I think we’ve been quite separated from what’s going on over there with what we see on the news (etc.) but the documentary really doesn’t pull its punches when it shows you what an Invasion looks like from the people being invaded. In light of recent (literally hours ago) events — I think that people need to see the type of shit that poor country is dealing with.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all.</p> <p>There&#39;s a particular micro-genre of movie that I&#39;ve identified which I call: Artists Vs The World</p> <p>In these movies the main protagonist is an artist / group of artists who are compelled by nothing other than their love for their craft and desire to create / perform, but they are constantly thwarted by the normies of the world, or other such mundane garbage society throws at them.</p> <p>It&#39;s pretty much my favorite type of movie, but they are few and far between, and can span many genres since it&#39;s not really an established thing. Because of this, they can be tricky to identify and hard to come by, but I&#39;d like to find as many as possible, so I&#39;m curious what other examples you all can throw at me. To help understand exactly what I&#39;m talking about, here&#39;s my list of the ones I&#39;ve identified (that I can remember) ranked:</p> <p>1 - The Wrestler / Black Swan (companion films)<br/> 2 - Great Balls

## Road House has turned into a must watch classic for me

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Never thought the day would come when the &quot;so bad it&#39;s good&quot; Road House would become a must watch classic for me every time it&#39;s on, almost up there with Goodfellas and Jaws, but here I am.</p> <p>Despite all its flaws, I just can&#39;t change the channel any time I see it on the listing of movies on. I&#39;ve seen it three times within the last week and doubt I&#39;d not watch it if it happens to be on.</p> <p>Only bona fide great films usually get to this level for me. Yet, here is Road House. I&#39;m starting to question whether this is actually a great movie if it&#39;s that rewatchable. It&#39;s just so much FUN and has so many scenes that you look forward to watching. Is it time to lock Road House in as a legit 8/10 classic and override its poor reviews from when it came out once and for all?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Top_Cranberry_3254"> /u/Top_Cranberry_3254 </a> <

## "Blue Streak" is the perfect action movie to utilize a comedy star

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you look at the reviews for Martin Lawrence &amp; Luke Wilson&#39;s <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_streak">Blue Streak</a>, you will see a lot of bad critic reviews and pretty good but not amazing audience reviews. It appears to be just a regular action/comedy. I mean Martin&#39;s gotten some big success with the Bad Boys franchise, but most of what he does doesn&#39;t exactly have broad appeal. From afar, this movie again seems like just some generic TNT at 3 pm movie.</p> <p>The thing though is that it takes <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009">Saves the Cat</a> to the absolute extreme. Basically, the idea is you have your hero literally save a cat so that the audience likes them more for doing a heroic/cool act. This movie&#39;s formula is a constant string of Saves the Cat scenes but they use Martin&#39;s comedy to carry each scene. Like it has him in a heist where he&#39;s an expert

During dinner with Tommy&#39;s mother at 2am, Jimmy twists a glass ketchup bottle on his meal. If I ever see these actual glass bottles at the store I&#39;d get one and try it to see what happens.
