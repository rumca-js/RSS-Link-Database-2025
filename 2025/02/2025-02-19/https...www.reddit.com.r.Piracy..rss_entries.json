I\u2019d like to be sure that the software when patched didn\u2019t include any malware, specifically something like a key logger or similar, sending data out. Malwarebytes and Windows security didn\u2019t pick up anything before or after installation and usage. I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m good to go or if I need to monitor its network activity.

Maybe all of the above lmao. Anyway my family lives in 4 different states so we spend time together watchin movies or shows on Discord but now I guess they invaded our privacy and banned the server. I wanted to know if anyone has ever used any Modded Discord clients to stream and if they have any suggestions or what not.

I chose flac format on all of them as thats wat i normally go for but it got me thinking that some of the songs might not come in flac quality so what happens to those files? Does converting those songs that for example only come in mp3 to flac result in any audio quality loss or does that only happen if i go from a lossless to a lossy file like converting flac to mp3? Im thinking i should just go back and redownload them using the original format highest download option just to be safe as im assuming that wont upscale or descale the song correct?

I&#39;m using a reverse proxy (running on a separate pi) to point my dns to the jellyfin for remote access. I then have a separate, old windows desktop that I converted to do all my torrenting, but it saves everything onto the NAS. The reason I set it up this way was to have my torrents running through my VPN client (protonvpn) while the rest of the media streaming/playing/etc could be done direct. The NAS does not support split-tunnelling for a VPN connection, so I thought this would be the next best option for what I had on hand. Up until now, this has worked out for me locally.
