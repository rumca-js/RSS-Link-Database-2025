Whichever is your own point of view on the line between these two extremes, come to this journey through the first know implementation of session types in C++ if you want: to see the main idea of session types explained in practical programming terms, to understand how and when session types might be useful, or just to enjoy exploring the limits of C++.\n\nThe talk targets wider audience, and does not require any strong mathematic",
