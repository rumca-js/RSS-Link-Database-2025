<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I’m using the new Reeder app on iOS and can’t seem to remove old Mastodon links from the Later section. Each link is a repost from a user, and when I toggle the Later button, it just re-adds them to the top of the list instead of removing them.</p> <p>Has anyone else encountered this issue or found a way to fix it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thespicyarrow"> /u/thespicyarrow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1itcxxv/trouble_removing_mastodon_links_from_later/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1itcxxv/trouble_removing_mastodon_links_from_later/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Sorry if this is not the right place for this, but I am using the NewsFlash RSS reader on Gnome and I cannot play videos in it. When I try the web scraper, I get a 403 error. I think this may have something to do with cookies and YouTube spam protection but I don&#39;t know. Please let me know if you have any ideas for troubleshooting this problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/choodleforreal"> /u/choodleforreal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1itafhu/403_errors_on_newsflash/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1itafhu/403_errors_on_newsflash/">[comments]</a></span>
