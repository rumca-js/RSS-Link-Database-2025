        "description": "The conflict escalates! The Chaos Space Marines have cleverly used the Cult uprising to distract the Imperium but have come under fire by the Librarians of the Ultramarines. This is the second and final battle of a two-part series we are doing to celebrate narrative wargaming and the spirit of our Narrative Tournament we host at Game Con Canada. https://gameconcanada.com/\n\nDice Tell Stories and we use Baron of Dice to forge a narrative in this one. https://baronofdice.com/?ref=PiWj5cSTlKyTsZ\n\nIn this Battle we play a Crusade mission: Myths and Monsters that pits key units against each other in the heart of battle. JT is the gamemaster and has some secret missions for both players. Tak is commanding the Ultramarines against guest player Daniel (Chaos Daniel not MWA Daniel) who has a pretty killer Chaos Space Marines force. Can the Space Marines stop Chaos from performing whatever diabolical ritual they are performing before it's too late?\n\nCHAOS SPACE MARINES: Renegade Raiders\nChaos L",
