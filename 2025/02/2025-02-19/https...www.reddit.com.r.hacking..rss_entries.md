<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know there&#39;s the common trope of Mr. Robot, Fight club, V for Vendetta, etc. where they try to change the world by doing extraordinarily impossible feats.</p> <p>But what level of skill and knowledge do you think it&#39;d actually take to cause that sort of change in the world? Even if it&#39;s beyond a single person, how many people of that skill level would it take? What would their resources look like? Could an APT do it? Would love to hear your thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yu_know_"> /u/yu_know_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iteijo/what_level_of_skill_would_it_actually_take_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iteijo/what_level_of_skill_would_it_actually_take_to/">[comments]</a></span>

My brother noticed some weird activity on his YouTube account, so I checked his Google security settings to see if anything was off. The only thing that stood out was an unknown device. I went through everything. Third-party app access, authentication tools, backup emails, phone numbers, recovery options. Nothing suspicious. Two-factor authentication is on. Nothing else looks out of place.</p> <p>The only thing I did find was OAuth activity in the Gmail &quot;Details&quot; section under Last Account Activity.

You needed to download nothing, just go to the website, post your url you wanted to clone et voilà. You could edit the whole page and a similar url was created, so that you could share it and prank your friends.</p> <p>But it would be cooler if this existed for youtube. An online generator that would let you edit a whole youtube video page. I heard about the chrome extension Edit This Website, but this only works on your own browser and you need to show your laptop to your friends to prank them.</p> <p>If it doesn&#39;t exist anymore, I suppose that this tools could do the trick :</p> <p>1) a website that doesn&#39;t clone but who looks like youtube and let you write a title, upload a thumbnail, write fake comments etc</p> <p>2) a prank url redirection generator. Imagine your friends clicking on a vague similar youtube link like this <a href
