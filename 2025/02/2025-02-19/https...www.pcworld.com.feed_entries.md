<p>Microsoft tips and tests new Windows 11 features throughout the year, as part of its Windows Insider programs. But there’s an almost surefire way to tell what features will actually arrive on your PC in the near future: a new Windows 11 Release Preview build. And one just dropped.</p>



<p>Microsoft released <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3321-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Windows 11 Build 26100.3321</a> to the Release Preview Channel this week, with a list of new features, including a new battery icon, an improved File Explorer, and tweaks to the Windows Spotlight screensaver. Given that it’s a “Release Preview,” Microsoft should be releasing it relatively soon.</p>



<p>This collection of new features isn’t as momentous as, say, a fall feature release. What’s important about it is the r

<p id="gpar1">Security researchers are warning of a dangerous malware that targets Windows systems. It’s a keylogger that monitors and copies keystrokes on devices in order to intercept passwords and other typed data.</p>



<p id="gpar1">As Fortinet <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortisandbox-detects-evolving-snake-keylogger-variant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>, this new variant of the Snake keylogger (also known as 404 Keylogger) is said to have been responsible for over 280 million attack attempts since the beginning of this year alone.</p>



<p id="gpar1">That’s only the number of attempts Fortinet has been able to investigate, by the way. The amount of unreported cases could be much higher.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and you need multiple monitors to be productive, then working on a laptop while on the go could be a pain in your neck — unless you have a portable monitor to go along with it.</p>



<p>Right now, you can score this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARZOPA-Portable-Kickstand-High-end-Entertainment/dp/B0CH9WLFTP/">Arzopa portable monitor for just $80 on Amazon</a>, down from its original $130 price tag.

<p>This is a beautiful 16.1-inch display. At this size, it’s likely even larger than your laptop screen! But it’s so thin that it won’t be an inconvenience to lug around. At just 0.35 inches thick and 1.69 pounds light,

<p>Are you looking to dive into the world of handheld PC gaming, but you’re put off by some sky-high prices? Then you might want to take a gander at Best Buy’s sales page today. The store is offering the original Asus ROG Ally in its souped-up Z1 Extreme flavor <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-ally-7-120hz-fhd-1080p-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-processor-512gb-white/6542964.p?skuId=6542964">for $449.99</a>. That’s $250 off the retail price and about half the price of the Ally X.</p>



<p>The original Ally was the first handheld gaming PC from a major vendor post-Steam Deck. It’s far from perfect, mostly due to a reliance on Windows 11, which simply isn’t as smooth as Valve’s SteamOS for handling games. But it is more powerful, with a higher-resolution 1080p 120Hz screen and an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. It’s also loaded with 16GB o

<p>According to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/x-almost-doubles-its-premium-pricing-following-grok-3-launch/">Neowin</a>, X has updated the price for Premium+ following the release of Grok-3.

## Nvidia’s new RTX 50-series cards have issues playing older PhysX games

<p>Technology always marches forward, but often there are a couple of hobbled lurches backwards at the same time. One of them appears to be Nvidia PhysX, a proprietary graphics technology that was all the rage about 20 years ago but has since fallen out of fashion. The system has been stealthily retired for the new RTX 50-series cards, leaving some old but beloved games in an awkward position.</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, PhysX is a system that adds physics effects to games with some dedicated acceleration tech. We’ve seen it in some very specific but very visible graphical examples, like dripping liquids, blowing hair, or hanging cloth. It was used in a lot of the biggest PC games from 2005 to 2013 or so, like <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> and <em>Borderlands 2</em>.</p>

<p>We’ve seen smart locks that you unlock with a keypad, a phone, or even facial recognition, but Eufy’s latest model—which is actually a video doorbell <em>and </em>a smart lock—serves up a relatively new way of opening your door by scanning your palm. </p>

<p>It’s hard not to fall in love with mini PCs when they’re so freakin’ powerful <em>and</em> so dang affordable. Here’s a shining example: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Gaming-Computer-PCIe4-0x4-Displays/dp/B0CZ8SBR3T/">this Beelink EQR6 is only $349 on Amazon</a>, a 27 percent discount off its original $479. A fantastic value at full price, a real steal with this price cut. (This is a Prime-only deal. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Start a free 30-day trial</a> to score this special price!)</p>



<p>This ultra-powered mini PC runs on an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX processor, a heaping 24GB of DDR5 RAM, and a fast 500GB PCIe 4.0 SSD. That’s a combination that’ll easily tackle any task you throw at it, from work assignments to media streaming, from video editing to casual gaming. Even better, this mini PC is easy to upgrade!

<p>One of the most interesting parts of Asus’ pre-CES 2025 presentation was the latest version of its ROG XG Mobile, a little brick that’s supposed to enhance your laptop with discrete GPU muscle. The new 2025 model doesn’t just use a new graphics card, but is now fully non-proprietary with a Thunderbolt 5 connection. And according to a new post, you’ll be able to order one starting February 25th.</p>



<p>The new ROG XG Mobile external GPU is basically, like the previous design, a laptop graphics card in a box. But a couple of new design elements make it much more appealing than previous models, starting with that hardware-agnostic 80Gbps Thunderbolt 5 connection. (Previous ROG XG Mobile designs used a proprietary cable that could only connect with some Asus gaming laptops, tablets, and the ROG Ally handheld.)</p>

Now, the company has <a href="https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=esr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated its release calendar</a>, which now says that Firefox Old ESR (Extended Support Release) will continue for another six months — at least up to August 19, 2025.</p>



<p>Firefox support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 will, according to the updated release calendar, be officially discontinued in September 2025. However, Mozilla also writes that they’ll re-evaluate the decision in August and announce if that end-of-support date changes.</p>
