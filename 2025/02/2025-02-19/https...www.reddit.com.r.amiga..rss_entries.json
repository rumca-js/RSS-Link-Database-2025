The game consisted in a single screen platformer, where this kind of penguins / alien penguins or something like that, had to push these for hexagon shaped boxes(Each one at a different symbol inside Like a triangle or a square or an X ) until they formed the pattern indicated in the center top of the screen. There were also some enemies which you could kill by hitting them with the boxes. The bosses consisted very large enemies that would take more than one hit to kill. </p> <p>I don&#39;t know if this is information enough, but it&#39;s all I have.</p> <p>Does anybody remember anything like this?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdeptExit6734\"> /u/AdeptExit6734 <",
