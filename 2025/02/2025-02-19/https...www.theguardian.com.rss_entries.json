The only issue is that when I get embarrassed or offended I tend to blush and go bright red. People then exclaim, \u201cYou\u2019re going red!\u201d which makes it even worse. I used to cover my skin with foundation, which was a comfort blanket. I feel the only way to hide this is to wear foundation, but I don\u2019t want to go back.
