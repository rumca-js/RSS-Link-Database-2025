<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/team-fortress-2-launch-review/1900-6190347/">Team Fortress 2</a> has been a very durable performer for Valve, having remained active for the better part of two decades. And while there have been several mods since Team Fortress 2 was launched in 2007, Valve has now released the game's entire source code, which may open the door to a lot of fan creations.</p><p>Valve made the announcement on <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Team Fortress 2's official page</a>, while noting that the source code gives mods builders "the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions." However, this code is being shared on a non-commercial basis. This means that programmers won't be able to sell creations that were made from Team Fortress 2's foundations. However, the new fan-made mods can be listed in the Steam Store as free releases.</p><p>The line between professional game makers

<p>Composer Jack Wall wrote the music for Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, but he did not return for Mass Effect 3 and has not worked with developer BioWare since. What gives? We don't know the whole story, but Wall said in an interview that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson "was not particularly happy with me at the end."</p><p>Despite that, Wall told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/14/the-making-of-mass-effect-2-music-soundtrack">The Guardian</a> he was "so proud" of the score for that game, going on to note that it received a BAFTA nomination, even if the game overall "didn't go as well as [Hudson] wanted." The music for Mass Effect 3 was written by a team including Sascha Dikiciyan, Sam Hulick, Christopher Lennertz, Cris Velasco, and Clint Mansell.</p><p>Discussing what sounded like a strained relationship with Hudson, Wall admitted, "Fallouts like that happen; it's just part of the deal."

<p>Sometimes, NPCs in games are just a way for the developers to communicate with players in the context of the story. Those in-game discussions are usually meant to guide players to their next step, but apparently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/">Avowed</a> community really wants the companions to shut up about their character getting upgraded gear. Obsidian Entertainment has released a day-one patch for Avowed, and near the top of the community requests was a note that companions will be making a lot fewer comments about players needing better armor or weapons.</p><p>One of the other community-requested changes is that players can no longer sell upgrade materials to merchants because it makes it harder to upgrade their characters without those resources.
