<p>As the status of an on-premises version of Oracle Database 23ai remains in limbo, the company has tossed a bone to its on-prem Oracle Database 19c customers in the form of an extension of Premier Support to Dec. 31, 2029, and Extended Support to Dec. 31, 2032.</p>



<p>This stretches Extended Support from its previous 2024-2027 timeline, announced in 2022, increasing the product’s lifespan by another five years. This emulates companies such as SAP, which is <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3809226/deadline-for-sap-users.html">granting reprieves</a> to its on-prem S/4HANA customers.</p>



<p>However, as with SAP, there are some gotchas. During the period from May 1, 2027, through Dec. 31,

<p>If you aren’t aware of the tectonic shift that is <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative artificial intelligence</a>, then I can only assume your phone has been on Airplane mode for the last year. You can’t swing a laptop bag these days without knocking over four startups doing something with AI. And that is great — it’s amazing technology that will apparently either solve all the world’s problems or wipe out mankind. Few folks seem to land anywhere in the middle.</p>



<p>And of course, we software developers are seeing the costs and benefits of leveraging AI in the software development process. Some belie

<p>Python’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2264616/get-started-with-async-in-python.html">asynchronous programming functionality</a>, or async for short, allows you to write programs that get more work done by not waiting for independent tasks to finish. The <code>asyncio</code> library is a set of tools included with Python for asynchronously processing disk or network I/O.</p>



<p><code>asyncio</code> provides two kinds of APIs for dealing with asynchronous operations: <em>high-level</em> and <em>low-level</em>. The high-level APIs are the most generally useful, and applicable to the widest variety of applications. The low-level APIs are powerful, but also complex and less frequent

<p>Elixir is one of the most interesting stories in the world of programming languages right now. Built on the Erlang ecosystem, Elixir offers a fresh take on <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2263963/what-is-functional-programming-a-practical-guide.html">functional programming</a> and new ways of thinking about concurrency and fault tolerance.</p>



<p>We’ll start with a quick review of the overall syntactic flavor of Elixir and how it handles collections. Then, we’ll look at how it approaches pattern matching, looping, and concurrency. These are standard features for any programming language, but Elixir’s approach is different from what you might expect.</p>
