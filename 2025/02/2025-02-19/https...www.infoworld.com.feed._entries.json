Built on the Erlang ecosystem, Elixir offers a fresh take on <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/2263963/what-is-functional-programming-a-practical-guide.html\">functional programming</a> and new ways of thinking about concurrency and fault tolerance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll start with a quick review of the overall syntactic flavor of Elixir and how it handles collections. Then, we\u2019ll look at how it approaches pattern matching, looping, and concurrency. These are standard features for any programming language, but Elixir\u2019s approach is different from what you might expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-head",
