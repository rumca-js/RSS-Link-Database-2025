## What’s wrong with a classic server-side rendered (SSR) multi-page application (MPA) for most web apps? What’s so appealing about HTMX in early stages of development?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently built a web app with Django and used only a tiny bit of Alpine.js (less than 100 lines of JavaScript, in total). At first, I was excited about giving HTMX a try and adding it to the project, but the need never came. The UX feels good despite a full-page load on any navigation or form submission.</p> <p>This makes me view HTMX as a nice-to-have thing or an optimization, so I’m a bit confused as to why people choose to use it so early in development.</p> <p>In terms of UX, the experience HTMX provides is closer to a client-side rendered (CSR) web app than it is to a classic MPA SSR web app, so there is some sense in using HTMX if one wants to keep the UX.</p> <p>As a user of the web (and a software engineer), I don’t care even a little about whether a web app is using CSR or SSR as long as it’s working and stable. In fact, in my experience, there’s a higher chance for me to have a worse UX when using a CSR web app, so I might even prefer cla
