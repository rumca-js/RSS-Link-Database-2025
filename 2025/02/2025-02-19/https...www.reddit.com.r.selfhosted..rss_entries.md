<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came across the FUTO Wiki guide for email hosting but it doesn&#39;t mention incoming mail protection. Someone here mentioned Proxmox Mail Gateway and said it&#39;ll even store emails before forwarding on to me, if I host it in the cloud, if my server isn&#39;t online. </p> <p>The FUTO Wiki suggests using Postmark, a SMTP Relay, to send my emails. Should I use Proxmox Mail Gateway on the receiving end before my email server?</p> <p>I&#39;m gonna be testing this all with free trials and stuff to make sure everything still works, but I just really want to try and switch away from the big email providers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m new to self-hosting so please excuse my ignorance. I have a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and I&#39;ve installed nginx to get a basic html website running on my local network. I also recently bought a domain through Cloudflare. To my understanding, I could serve my website that&#39;s running on Pi to the internet by installing Cloudflare on the Pi and connecting the local host IP for the website/Pi to the tunnel on the Cloudflare dashboard.</p> <p>Is this a suitable way to host my first website? My main concern is security; I don&#39;t want to connect the tunnel to the website and unintentionally expose my local network to the rest of the world. Also, I know that using Cloudflare means this method would not be true self-hosting, but I just want to get my website running on my local hardware accessible through the domain I bought without using a cloud machine or VM. Any feedback is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I first bought a 4TB drive long ago that has been serving me well for Plex, but I want to expand my little server for more, specifically for 4k movies and replacing my cloud storage.</p> <p>I just bought myself 5 more 4TB drives, and I&#39;m thinking of doing some sort of RAID array to have a 4 drive data pool + 2 for parity. I am a full on newbie to this sort of things, so I&#39;ll have to research that.</p> <p>However, my main worry is data loss. How can I implement all of my six drives into this RAID array without losing my already existing collection? Can I create the array as 4+1, dump my data from the old drive to the array, and then add the drive as another parity drive? What is my best solution here?</p> <p>Thanks for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/key4427"> /u/key4427 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1itcsfx/how_to_create_a_raid_array_with

There&#39;s no diarization, so it&#39;s kinda hit-or-miss.</p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for is a way for me to dump an audio file somewhere, and come back either in a few minutes or tomorrow (I really don&#39;t care about speed) with a transcript and a summary of what was talked about.</p> <p>I have NextCloud - being able to dump it there would be great.
