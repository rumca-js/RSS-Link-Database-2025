<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently passivly learning spanish because of my mum, so i wanted to start reading to further expand on that. I specifically want books from Ecuador because that is where my mum is originally from, and I feel like that would help me learn the ``correct`` spanish, plus it would give me more cultrual refrences if you guys know what I mean. I have read a lot of different books but my current favorite books right now are Demian by Herman Hesse, The midnight library by Matt Haig, and I am now reading Breast and eggs by Mieko Kawakami. Does anyone know any books that might be similar by authors from Ecuador or maybe even from latin america. Or if you guys know any books that might help with learning spanish (latin american spanish specifically), I would appreciate that. I apologise for my english or if anything is written weirdly. Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CantaDorado"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I (27F) have started to notice an overall decline in my cognitive faculties due to ADHD and other mental illness. I have several areas in my life that I want to work on (auditory/visual processing, memory, and communication skills) as I know this is one of the causes of the majority of my poor emotional regulation and stress. I’ve noticed I have tried to avoid doing mentally stimulating activities for virtually my entire life because I’ve always been pretty slow and uninterested (as well as never pushed to), however I’m realizing now that I need to improve these areas to improve relationships and prevent additional cognitive decline and forgetfulness. I’m normally an artsy person and also spend a lot of my free time playing video games/ watching TV, which I feel has been detrimental to my personal well-being.</p> <p>For background: I am almost finished with a Doctor of Pharmacy program so I do know how to process complicated informatio

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished The Time Master trilogy by Louise Cooper. And wow, what an epic tale. I&#39;m looking for anything else in the same vein.</p> <p>Basically this sorcerer arrives at this school of pages, naturally our protagonist is more lifted than the other students. Comes to find out he is destined to bring an end to Light and issue in an Age of Dark. Not everything is so black and white, Light is not inherently good, Dark is not inherently evil. Demons are not inherently cruel and God&#39;s are not inherently righteous.</p> <p>Does our protagonist fight against fate or does he succumb to his destiny? All of this made the series so good. The first book built up to this awesome reveal of his destiny, the second book was his downfall and the 3rd is his redemption arc. It was so good and I need more like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jehrok9"> /u/jehrok9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://ww

I’ve never been good at committing to reading as a leisurely hobby, and I’m determined to change that. </p> <p>In 2025 I’m hoping to read at least 6 books (child’s play to most of you, I’m sure), but I want to give myself a realistic goal that will set me up to stick with it. </p> <p>My first book down of 2025 was Project Hail Mary which I loved. It struck the perfect notes of lighthearted, funny, quirky, wholesome and adventure for me, and I’m definitely a sucker for space exploration themed stories. </p> <p>I’m not afraid to admit that my reading comprehension and overall attention span when reading are rusty at best, so I ask that you keep that in mind. </p> <p>That being said, do any good recommendations come to mind? PHM was right up my alley and I’d love some reccos that fit that bill in some shape or form. Definitely does not need to be space or sci-fi, but just overall

## So I'm looking for a good coming of age story with a child that feels themself as smart and capable as any adult fighting for agency over their own life despite being seen as a minor or too young by everyone else.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very much a fan of fanfiction and stories that have a similar vibe. I also generally see this in fanfiction where the main character is a child who was reborn with memories intact from a previous life and has issues with authority and a past/ knowledge of the character/ story they got reborn into that makes them feel like letting parents, the government, or just adults in general be in charge of their life is a bad idea. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen any normal published books like that though. I would love to see one where the MC is just a child prodigy or something and is making the same struggles without it being fanfiction or reincarnation. I guess the closest I could think of is Ender&#39;s Game but that isn&#39;t quite right and it is more of adults expecting too much from a child and using him as a sacrifice for the greater good. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Isekai_litrpg"> /u

I recently reread &quot;If You&#39;re In My Office, It&#39;s Already Too Late&quot; by James Sexton, and It&#39;s currently the gold standard for me as far as relationship and self-help books. </p> <p>This is not a review, but If you haven&#39;t read it, I like it because the author is a divorce attorney. Rather than following the protocol for advice books, he wrote a guide on how NOT to fuck up the relationship based on his experiences. I found it engaging, funny, and truly insightful. It&#39;s filled with anecdotes that grab my attention.</p> <p>I realize a billion people have asked similar questions, but I&#39;m specifically looking for something likewise distinct; a twist on the classic &quot;how to&quot; book that offers wisdom and perspective without becoming preachy or boring. Specifically something available on Audible, since I &quot;read&quot; a lot at work. Thanks! </p> </
