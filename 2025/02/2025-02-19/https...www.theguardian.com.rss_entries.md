<p>Pep Guardiola had asked his team to at least give the Santiago Bernabéu a fright; instead, they were the ones exposed to a terrifying truth, wearing a haunted hollow look. It is not just that Manchester City’s Champions League campaign is over, a Kylian Mbappé hat-trick sending Real Madrid through here; it is them. The team that Guardiola said was a machine for eight years is no more. City’s manager had said he was lying when he gave his team a 1% chance of going through, and so it proved: it was not even that high.</p><p>There was no comeback, not even a glimpse, of one. No epic, just the end. When they scored in the last minute, it was greeted with ironic cheers, this stadium continuing to laugh at them as they had done for some time now. The goal did not matter: the only bad news on a perfect night was the yellow card that means Jude Bellingham will miss the first leg against Bayer Leverkusen or Atlético Madrid. Real Madrid were superb, confirming that they are candidates for t

<p>The rule of law is under threat around the world, making it all the more vital to defend it at home</p><p>Separation of the judiciary from other branches of power is a recent innovation in Britain’s constitution. The supreme court was established in 2009 and a culture of respect for the independence of the courts is&nbsp;not deeply entrenched.</p><p>Earlier this week, Lady Carr reminded Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch of that duty. The lady chief justice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/18/top-judge-deeply-troubled-by-pmqs-exchange-on-gaza-asylum-case">rebuked</a> the prime minister and the Conservative leader for exchanges in the Commons last week regarding a court decision in the case of a family of refugees from Gaza.

<p>As Europe innovates to boost defence without public service cuts, Britain clings to fiscal restraint – an unaffordable risk in an unstable world</p><p>When settling wars rewards lawlessness, displaces populations and fuels lasting grievances, the result is more war. That was the former foreign secretary William&nbsp;Hague’s <a href="https://archive.ph/CiQ2V">verdict</a> on Donald Trump’s approach to peacemaking, drawing lessons from the Balkans, the second world war and the Middle East. A more insecure world will require Britain to increase defence spending. The UK currently could not sustain major troop deployments in Ukraine, undermining the idea it&nbsp;could provide Kyiv with “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/16/starmer-ready-to-put-british-troops-on-the-ground-in-ukraine-if-peace-deal-reached">security guarantees</a>”.</p><p>This is a dilemma faced across Europe, leading the EU to see <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/eu-leaders-ask-e

<p>US president loses grip on reality, while delegates at a rightwing conference in London remain cocooned from real world</p><p>Even by his recent standards, Tuesday night’s stream of unconsciousness from Donald Trump took some beating. Hot on the tail of excluding Ukraine from the first round of peace talks with Russia and in effect threatening to withdraw the US from Nato, the Donald has now suggested it was Kyiv who started the war with Moscow.</p><p>More than that, he declared President Zelenskyy’s popularity ratings had slid to just 4% in his own country and that he had assumed the role of dictator by not holding elections. He ended by claiming that the US had given more than three times as much aid to Ukraine than the rest of Europe combined. You could almost hear Vladimir Putin cheering from the sidelines. He couldn’t have written the script any better. It was perfection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/19/trump-trumps-himself-with-latest-delusional

In recent years, most large developers have been doing very well in terms of profit margins and shareholder returns without having to increase their output at all. Why should they bother to do more?</p><p>The only way the government will get close to its target is by stumping up the money for investment in new social homes, exerting stronger control over increasing land values along the way.

But the world’s oldest international fixture takes on a different complexion in even-numbered years. Edinburgh’s cold, malty air, the walk down past Haymarket (before the trams), the distant hills, the lone piper on the Murrayfield roof … the pre-match mood always recalls the glorious tartan-tinted newspaper intro from years back. “Can we do it? Aye, I think we can.” Even as a kid, watching the great Andy Irvine from afar, and then subsequently as a uni student in Edinburgh, the most memorable matches always involved England being sent homeward to think again.

Hong Kong and Vilnius have much stronger claims to this shameful title ...</p><p>Having worked in the advertising industry for a while, I can tell you that creating a great ad is a lot more difficult than skewering a bad ad.

Her protagonist is Zelu, a prickly, mercurial, iconoclastic writer who gets high in inappropriate situations, hooks up promiscuously, and ends up quarrelling with everyone, especially her large, overprotective Nigerian American family. She is also paraplegic, and has PTSD from the accident that left her disabled at the age of 12.</p><p>As the book begins, she loses her job as a writing professor for giving an entitled student a brutal critique, on the same day that her novel is rejected by a 10th publisher, and while she is at her sister’s wedding, under an onslaught of uncensored judgment from all her most&nbsp;conservative family members.

<p>A medieval Haute-Savoie village makes a great base for a gourmet break, with delicious comfort food and local wines.

Rather than put me off, the scent heightened my appetite for the cheese blowout that was to come.</p><p>Sat at a wooden communal table inside the pine-walled restaurant run by the farm’s owner, Blandine Dunoyer, I waited for the bonanza of mountain comfort food: fondue savoyarde, tartiflette, raclette, then <em>diots</em> (smoked pork sausages) with polenta. Somehow, I found room for <em>potée savoyarde</em>, a rib-sticking dish of slow-cooked pork shoulder, cabbage and potatoes, then a round of top-notch alpine cheese, <em>reblochon</em> and <em>tomme de </em><em>

My husband and I had been together for 17 years and had recently celebrated our 14th wedding anniversary. We were plodding along just fine: comfortable, slightly complacent, grunting at each other from behind our phones, eating dinner in front of the telly, focusing on childcare, keeping on keeping on&nbsp;– like most of our married friends. When our mortgage payments doubled, paying for a babysitter to&nbsp;go on nights out alone seemed an&nbsp;unnecessary expense.</p><p>On New Year’s Eve, we went to a party at the home of another couple&nbsp;– parents of a child in our son’s class: a bring-kids-along, more-the-merrier thing.
