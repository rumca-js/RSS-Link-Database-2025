Launch SteamVR<br/> 6. Wait for some time for it to launch until I stand in my SteamVR room, ready to start whatever game I&#39;d like to play</p> <p>This was my normal routine for like a year, until suddenly everything stops at point 6. Instead of SteamVR just launching and sending me into my SteamVR room, I just see the SteamVR icon appear in my Windows task bar and when I minimize all my windows, I see, that there appeared the little SteamVR window showing essentially nothing along with an error message:<br/> &quot;SteamVR Fail<br/> A key component o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all...I&#39;ve been trying to figure out a way to translate actions on my controllers (i.e., button presses, trigger pulls, grip squeezes) while playing PCVR games to keypresses that can be understood by other apps in Windows. It&#39;s a pretty common use case; for example, I&#39;ve seen posts from VR gamers wanting to cue up music tracks while immersed in a game without having to pause. In my case, I&#39;d like to be able to start an OBS game camera recording session in the background using a hotkey.</p> <p>If you&#39;re using SteamVR (as is often the case), Steam allows you to set up key bindings with your controllers. However, SteamVR by itself uses a lot of system resources. The advent of OpenXR (OpenComposite) enables us to run resource-hungry games like MS Flight Sim, Skyrim VR without using SteamVR, resulting in significant performance gains. Think of OpenXR as a slimmed-down SteamVR, without all the extra baggage (i.e., Steam Home). It wor
