Switching to X11 fixes this (but I would like to use Wayland).</p> <p>While playing (some) games on Steam that run with Proton (Ready or Not, Titanfall 2), other applications like discord, librewolf, steam, and spotify will stop rendering properly after a few minutes. Dead by Daylight(Proton) and CS2(Native), for example, do not cause this issue. The apps will only freeze graphically and are still interactable. If I close the app and re-open it, it will become translucent. Only when I close the game before I re-open an app does the GUI begin to function normally again.</p> <p>I did notice that the freeze only happens when the GPU is under heavy load (In the middle of a match). Many times when I load back into the main menu or in one specific case for Ready or Not, the headquarters, the app

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>Over the past month or so, I have been toying with Linux on my main gaming PC, and I have been having a great time. Everything regarding the Linux system feels much more &quot;connected&quot;, and I&#39;ve just been having a good time learning it.</p> <p>I have had experience with Linux servers via my job, toying with simple distros on my laptop, and hobby of making my own home server, so I am not a complete novice to Linux as an OS, but I am pretty new to the desktop, and very new to gaming on Linux.</p> <p>With that said, the only issue I&#39;ve been having on Linux is stuttering, and/or inconsistent FPS in gaming.</p> <p>I confirmed these stutters with Mangohud, where the frametime will jump from an average of 5ms to 30+ ms for a brief moment. This does not happen at all on my Windows 10 install.</p> <p>Again, this is NOT about the general experience using desktop environments. Everything is working fine there.</
