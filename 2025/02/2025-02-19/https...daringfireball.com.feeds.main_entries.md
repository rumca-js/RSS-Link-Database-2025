  <p>A regular person might read that headline and think, “wow, a
startup sold for <em>nine-figures</em> — impressive.” Of course, it’s
not impressive in this case. It’s a fire sale for a company that
has been under duress for months after their product, the Ai Pin,

me for sort of <a href="https://spyglass.org/vision-pro-launch-disaster/">re-using a headline here</a> — but this
situation is much more akin to the Hindenburg disaster from which
the phrase originates.</p>
