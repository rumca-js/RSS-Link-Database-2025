That means I&#39;ll have the opportunity to help kids who no one has tried to help or didn&#39;t want to help.</p> <p>You can all be proud of yourselves.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi experts, I am a curator and along the way I have collected over 1k website links which are in demand in my country. (Have done the keyword research). I am in the process of building a small directory website of other website links. I have 3 questions:</p> <ol> <li>Do the links in my lists have to be nofollow? All the links will open in a new tab. I don&#39;t have a paid model. If the website gets traffic, the only monetization I am considering is through ads.</li> <li>I understand dynamic search results may not fare well with seo. Should I just create 100s of pages of lists against all tags. Links are categorized and tagged. My homepage has categories listed.</li> <li>Lastly, if someone can recommend a lightweight wordpress plugin that works for listing only websites that can be categorized and tagged. It&#39;s not a business directory, I do not need features like geo that most biz directories provide.</li> </ol> <p>Thanks so much for reading this
