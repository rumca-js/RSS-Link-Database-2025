<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, if you need more distractions in battle than your two companions provide, it&#8217;s worth putting up with some tough fights to find the treasure.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure, the reference image is just rocks and water, but there&#8217;s only one area in the region with red water: the Sulfur Mines.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Making matters worse, the map and its treasure are in dangerous locations as well, though some careful sneaking can get you through without much issue, and the reward is an essential piece of kit for wizards.

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a <strong>max level cap</strong> in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/avowed/444453">Avowed</a></em>, meaning you can’t unlock literally every ability in the game at once.</p>
