<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(*or any of its sequels)</p> <p>I was just shown <em>Fight Night Round 4</em> for the first time which has an interesting control scheme. It has you use the thumbstick to control arm movements, so it almost feels like a WiiMote+Nunchuck setup. The game got <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/fight-night-round-4/">very good reviews</a> so I&#39;m probably just impatient, because I find these controls awkward as hell. (all other aspects of the game are pretty great tho- excellent presentation)</p> <p>But it got me thinking... boxing games. I&#39;ve played a few in my years as a gamer, and they&#39;re usually pretty clunky. I feel boxing benefits from an arcade-style approach (as opposed to simulation) even more than other sports games, which is why <em>Punch-Out!!</em> really shined.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/dreamcast/198428-ready-2-rumble-boxing/reviews">Ready 2 Rumble Boxing</a> and <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t remember much about the game but I do know at least a portion of it was played in a bar. I do not believe it was the game Space Bar. If my memory is correct, the title of the game has the detective&#39;s name in it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/imakethingsgoboom"> /u/imakethingsgoboom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ist2xd/looking_for_the_title_of_an_early_pc_sci_fispace/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ist2xd/looking_for_the_title_of_an_early_pc_sci_fispace/">[comments]</a></span>

## Got this instead of a PS5 (I know, I’m probably losing my mind), but I never had one as a kid (just every other weird, obscure console lol), but I always wanted one. What are some ‘Must-Play’ games on this thing? #midlifecrisis
