Swap Arnold for Homer Simpson looking for the favorite toy for Christmas at the last-minute and that&#39;s what it is. But also the humor/comedy of the movie felt exactly like Simpsons in the late 90&#39;s (when the movie came out).</p> <p>They have the santas singing only for Arnold to punch them all out, the neighbor is literally a more annoying version of Ned Flanders, you have Arnold rushing through the mall crashing into customers looking for toys getting beaten up by women calling him a pervert, you have the older police officer on the motorcycle who Arnold keeps crashing into and getting into trouble with, etc. Then you have Sinbad&#39;s role and everything else. It&#39;s just literally a live-action Simpsons episode.</p> <p>(also props to Jake Lloyd here for his movie role right before The Phantom Menace only 2 years later)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",

Because of this, they can be tricky to identify and hard to come by, but I&#39;d like to find as many as possible, so I&#39;m curious what other examples you all can throw at me. To help understand exactly what I&#39;m talking about, here&#39;s my list of the ones I&#39;ve identified (that I can remember) ranked:</p> <p>1 - The Wrestler / Black Swan (companion films)<br/> 2 - Great Balls",

I&#39;ve seen it three times within the last week and doubt I&#39;d not watch it if it happens to be on.</p> <p>Only bona fide great films usually get to this level for me. Yet, here is Road House. I&#39;m starting to question whether this is actually a great movie if it&#39;s that rewatchable. It&#39;s just so much FUN and has so many scenes that you look forward to watching. Is it time to lock Road House in as a legit 8/10 classic and override its poor reviews from when it came out once and for all?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Top_Cranberry_3254\"> /u/Top_Cranberry_3254 </a> <",

It appears to be just a regular action/comedy. I mean Martin&#39;s gotten some big success with the Bad Boys franchise, but most of what he does doesn&#39;t exactly have broad appeal. From afar, this movie again seems like just some generic TNT at 3 pm movie.</p> <p>The thing though is that it takes <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009\">Saves the Cat</a> to the absolute extreme. Basically, the idea is you have your hero literally save a cat so that the audience likes them more for doing a heroic/cool act. This movie&#39;s formula is a constant string of Saves the Cat scenes but they use Martin&#39;s comedy to carry each scene. Like it has him in a heist where he&#39;s an expert",
