<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, i&#39;m looking for some camera module, connected preferably via USB, not ribbon cable, that would work with my 3b+. Camera of the phone that i currently use for this purpose is 13 MP, so i think that camera with similar specs should be ok. It has to be as cheap as possible.</p> <p>I want to use it mounted on a spotting scope.</p> <p><strong>Context:</strong></p> <p>Currently i use some old phone with the scope, but it&#39;s not the most convenient setup.</p> <p><em>Best case scenario:</em></p> <p>Camera connected to pi, hosting some web app that would show the image on other device and it would track changes on viewed image (points on shooting target).</p> <p><em>Second best:</em></p> <p>As above, but without tracking points.</p> <p><em>Project minimum:</em></p> <p>Image from camera showing on screen connected directly to the PI.</p> <p><strong>I would appreciate some suggestions for specific modules that would be usefull for this project.</stro

When I plug it in with or without an SD card the green light blinks 3 long and 1 short.
