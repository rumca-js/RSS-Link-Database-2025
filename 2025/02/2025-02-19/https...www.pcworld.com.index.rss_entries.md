<p>In the future, Microsoft suggests, you may be playing AI. No, not on the battlefield, but on games that actually use AI to simulate the entire game itself.</p>



<p>As a first step, Microsoft has developed an AI model, called WHAM, that “beta tests” games early in the development cycle using AI instead of human players.</p>



<p>Gamers know that realistic AI can turn a good game into something great, like how the older <em>F.E.A.R.</em> games would realistically model how soldiers might react to a hostile, armed player. Microsoft’s World and Human Action Model (WHAM) takes the opposite approach — it tries to figure out how human players will react in a given situation, right down to a specific frame or setup within the existing game world. Microsoft calls this WHAM by the name “Muse.”</p>



<p>The point of Muse’s WHAM, Microsoft said, wasn’t to improve

<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/broadcom-tsmc-eye-possible-intel-deals-that-would-split-storied-chip-maker-966b143b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, Broadcom is said to be interested in Intel’s chip designs while TSMC may want to take over the company’s manufacturing capabilities. Although nothing is official, Intel’s acting chairman Frank Yeary is reported to have met with potential buyers and representatives from the Trump administration.</p>



<p>With Intel being a major recipient of funds from the US CHIPS and Science Act (having received up to $7.86 billion in aid), any buyout would have to take into account US security requirements and would require Intel to retain majority ownership of its factories in a sale.</p>



<p>One solution being discussed is for Broadcom and TSMC to split Intel, with o

<p>Have you ever been in a situation where your PC was almost out of storage space? Or you needed to transfer lots of big files between machines? It’s a tough spot to be in if you aren’t prepared.</p>



<p>For many, the simplest solution is to grab some external storage, whether that’s a USB flash drive or — for data-heavy operations — an external drive. Indeed, portable SSDs have gotten pretty popular in recent years, promising loads of space and fast speeds in a convenient form factor. If you’re set on buying one, get one of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">our top picks for external drives</a>.</p>



<p>But many portable SSDs are actually a pretty raw deal when you get down to it. Not only does the convenient form factor limit what you can do with the drive, but the storage is often of a lower class and marked up

<p>Windows and most applications save their configuration in the registry database — or registry, for short. Whenever you change a setting, this affects the corresponding value in the registry, but there are also values in the registry for which there is no equivalent in a configuration tool.</p>



<p>Many tech-savvy Windows users probably have some settings that they change immediately when they install Windows. Other adjustments are made more or less regularly — for example, to provide variety in the desktop design or because certain tasks require it.</p>



<p>A search in the “Settings” helps to find the available options. However, it is still tedious to configure everything as desired. In addition, you sometimes have to dig through subcategories, and sometimes even use the Control Panel under Windows 11 or navigate through several tabs.</p>
