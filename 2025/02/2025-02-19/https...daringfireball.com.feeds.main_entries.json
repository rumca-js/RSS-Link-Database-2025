It\u2019s a fire sale for a company that\nhas been under duress for months after their product, the Ai Pin,\nfailed to catch fire in the market. Actually, that\u2019s not\ntechnically true. There was a <em>literal</em> risk of fire when charging\nthe device, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Humane-Recalls-Charge-Case-Accessory-for-Ai-Pin-Due-to-Lithium-Battery-Fire-Hazard?ref=spyglass.org\">which led to a recall</a>.
