I’ve tried several services in the past, but honestly, there was always something off: either the channels I wanted would disappear or I’d be hit with constant buffering at the worst possible moments.</p> <p>But switching to SMARTSGI has been like night and day. The picture quality has been top-notch every single time, and – here’s the best part – absolutely no buffering. It’s such a relief, especially as someone who loves watching live sports. There’s nothing worse than trying to catch a game and missing big moments because of streaming issues, but I haven’t had a single hiccup since I started with SMARTSGI .</p> <p>They also have a really good range of international channels, which has been a nice bonus. The setup was smooth and simple, and
