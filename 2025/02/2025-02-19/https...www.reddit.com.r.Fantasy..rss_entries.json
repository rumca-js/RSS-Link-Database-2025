I think in order to fully appreciate a book like this, it is best to detach oneself from the very tropes it helped establish. Read it as if you have no previous notion of wood elves or dwarven mountain kings, or dragons guarding hoards of gold, and you might get a better picture of the story these things create as a whole.</p> <p>In many ways, this book differs quite a bit from many &quot;hero&#39;s journey&quot; storylines. It doesn&#39;t begin with some horrible tragedy where his home is destroyed, it begins in a warm and comfortable home that he is quite content to stay in. He isn&#39;t necessarily motivated by revenge or some noble ambition, but rather for gold. But there is one other thing that ultimately drives Mr Baggins to go on his quest. His mother&#39;s side of the family, the Tooks, were quite inclined to adventures unlike his father&#39;s Mr Baggin&#3",

I was wondering if you guys have recommendations for stories in which characters learn to treat their friends better than they have in the past. For those who have read Green Bone Saga, something like <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Kaul Hilo&#39;s arc, like how he grows to treat Niko better than Anden</span>, but in treatment of friends rather than treatment of family, would be perfect. Just something to inspire me and remind me that there is a bright light at the end of this tunnel.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Udy_Kumra\"> /u/Udy_Kumra </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iswao8/stories_about_characters_learning_to_be_better/",
