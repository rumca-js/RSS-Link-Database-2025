President Trump recently fired a swath of Inspectors General in a late night purge of government watchdogs. The former Inspectors General for USAID, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services, who were all recently dismissed, sit down with WSJ’s Damian Paletta to discuss why it’s important for this role to remain independent. They also discuss the long-term implications of the mass firing, the lawsuit against the Trump administration, Elon Musk’s DOGE and more.
