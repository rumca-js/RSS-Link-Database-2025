<p>The time is up for Skype, one of the O.G.s of online communication.</p>



<p>The once-popular 22-year-old communications software is being retired by Microsoft in May 2025, with the company’s Teams collaboration suite replacing its predecessor.</p>



<p>“Beginning March 2025, you will be able to sign into Microsoft Teams Free with your Skype credentials, and your chats and contacts will be right there ready for you,” according to a post on <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skype’s website</a>.</p>



<p>Teams will carry the free calling and messaging that was available in Skype, in addition to the former’s usual collaboration and teamwork features.

When users “prove they’re human” by clicking on the boxes containing traffic lights, crosswalks, buses and other objects specified in the challenge, that information is used to train models for Waymo’s self-drivi
