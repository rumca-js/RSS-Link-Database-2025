<p class="has-text-align-none">I get it, it can be hard to overcome your cynicism when faced with the conjunction of “roguelike” and “deckbuilder”, the two most pervasive buzzwords in indie gaming — especially in the wake of such perfect expressions of the form as <em>Slay the Spire</em> and <em>Balatro</em>. And it’s true that <em>Into the Restless Ruins</em>, which is currently available to play as a Steam Next Fest demo, isn’t trying too hard to differentiate itself with its pixel art and its dungeon-crawling premise. But it has one new idea, and it’s a really good one.</p>

In <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, players explore a new land — previously thought to be uninhabited — in the hopes of solving the mystery behind a new giant beast. <em>Wilds </em>has everything we expect from Monster Hunter games: challenging fights across lush landscapes, and the rewards of awesome armor sets and better gear carved directly from the last beast taken down.</p>
