<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> faithful have another option for times when a physical tabletop isn't feasible. Wizards of the Coast's Sigil is a 3D virtual tabletop (VTT) experience that borrows some elements from video games without straying too far from the joy of sitting around a table with like-minded cohorts. It <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1919-what-is-sigil-d-ds-new-immersive-3d-vtt" data-original-link="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1919-what-is-sigil-d-ds-new-immersive-3d-vtt">launched</a> publicly this week and is now available for anyone to try.</p>
<p>If you have no clue what a 3D VTT is, imagine a graphical recreation of all the hallmarks of tabletop D&amp;D: virtual versions of a game board, miniatures, dice, character sheets and so on. It isn't a full-on video game like <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/here-are-all-of

<p>Anyone looking for an alternative to Instagram might have a suitable candidate in <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/flashes-for-bluesky/id6741443033?l=en-GB" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/flashes-for-bluesky/id6741443033?l=en-GB">Flashes</a>, a recently launched app built on Bluesky that seems to get all the important basics right. Flashes technically launched on the App Store on February 24, but a series of updates released in the days after launch have made the app much easier to recommend.</p>
<p>If you remember an Instagram before Meta turned it into its Facebook replacement, you have the basic gist of what Flashes is. It's an app for sharing photos and videos, with some Bluesky-flavored wrinkles, like <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bluesky-now-lets-you-choose-your-own-algorit

<p>Square Enix just announced a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/goods/dq_golf/">new sub-brand called Dragon Quest Golf</a>, which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a team dedicated to making golf merchandise and accessories based on the long-standing JRPG franchise. As expected, one of the brand’s initial offerings is a golf ball based on the iconic blue Slime. This is typically the first enemy players encounter in a DQ game.</p>
<p>The company will showcase more merch at the 59th Japan Golf Fair on March 7, though Square Enix hasn’t yet revealed any other gear besides the aforementioned ball. I could see a golf bag based on a Weartiger or tees designed to resemble an Eggsoskeleton. Maybe a super-powerful driver named after a Golem? The possibilities are endless, though it’ll probably just show off a bunch of golf shirts and khakis with DQ branding.</p>

<p>Whether you want to back up the data on your PC, transfer videos from your Mac or offload a few games from your PlayStation 5, a portable SSD is a quick and easy way to expand your storage. These little bricks may cost more than traditional hard drives, but they’re significantly faster, lighter and more reliable. Figuring out the best portable SSD for you, though, isn’t as simple as just picking the one with the lowest price or the most space. (Well, it <em>can</em> be, but that wouldn’t be very efficient.) To help, we’ve weeded through the portable SSD market, tested a bunch of contenders and sorted out which ones offer the most value. You can find our top picks below, plus an overview of what to know before you buy.</p>
