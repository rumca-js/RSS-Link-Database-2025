        "description": "Researchers found that peristaltic pump flow mechanically breaks supersaturation to induce amyloid formation by hen egg white lysozyme, a-synuclein, amyloid b 1-40, and b2-microglobulin. The high shear stresses induced by peristaltic flow likely reflect those that occur the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that this factor could promote amyloidosis.",

        "description": "A multi-institutional research team has engineered a way to preserve the electrical properties of materials as they are shrunk to the nanoscale. The use of the soft substrate hexagonal boron nitride reduces damage to the atomic structure caused by strain, allowing materials to keep their conductive properties as films as thin as 12 nm.",
