Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it the \"opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"crimes\" in this videos context is used with rhetorical hyperbole because in 2025, most previously serious crimes are in fact legal or not prosecuted, so no statement about legality or factuality of alleged crimes are being made in this video.",
