You can reroll result you dislikes, however each reroll blocks one of your dice, so be careful. Rolled symbols can be used to clear map from minion, earn money, attack epics (supervillains), etc. If you do not keep killing epics, they will grow stronger and will spawn more minions, but focusing entirely on this task is futile, since epics are endless...</p> <p>Overall it feels like Pandemic mixed with Village Attacks.

I just wanted the components. I try to clean any used games before adding to my collection. I didn&#39;t want to put them in water or use bleach. I thought a quick spray of Lysol disinfectant would do the trick. Wrong. It caused a chemical reaction with the paint? Acted as if I sprayed everything with glue. The paint peeled where ever two merples touched. I&#39;m still super mad at myself.

## Scythe - question about the factory

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m quite enjoying Scythe recently, and bought a few upgrades. One that I considered was a plastic model for the factory. There&#39;s a few different ones available, 3d printed etc, and they all seem to have about 3 spaces to stand minis. I don&#39;t get why? I was under the impression though that opposing pieces would have to go through combat and the loser forced to retreat? So there shouldn&#39;t be instances where you&#39;d need to accomodate 2 pieces there, let alone 3? Am I misunderstanding a rule?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spiritual_Maize"> /u/Spiritual_Maize </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1izueop/scythe_question_about_the_factory/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1izueop/scythe_question_about_the_factory/">[comments]</a></span>
