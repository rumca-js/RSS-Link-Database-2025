I liked it so much that I also saw Happy Together, which did not disappoint in any way. I was already obsessed with Leslie Cheung after I saw Farewell My Concubin but seeing him play such a sexually explicit role after seeing him play a LGBT-related part in Farewell where it&#39;s more toned down and restrained, I loved it. </p> <p>And I became a huge fan of Faye Wong and Brigitte Lin. I mean, Tony Leung is in it, and he&#39;s always excellent, but for me, Brigitte Lin was so fascinating as a woman with a Blonde wig, being very Ninotchka-like, not showing any emotion and still being flirted by this guy, and I adore Faye Wong in this.

I think she really channels the vibe of the animation and brought Motoko to life. despite not being Japanese. You can tell she did her homework on the character and it wasn&#39;t just an easy paycheck</p> <p>I&#39;d say her biggest sin was being too big. she quickly became the female face of Hollywood, especially as an action star, aside from Black Widow I think Lucy came out before this and was critically panned. It also doesn&#39;t help that this movie wasn&#39;t great and didn&#39;t live up to the astronomical standards set by the anime. However, Scarjo did live up to it.
