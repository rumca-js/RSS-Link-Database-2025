Some non-book media I\u2019ve really enjoyed as well is Avatar (the Last Airbender), Hilda (Netflix), the Legend of Zelda (Majora\u2019s Mask was a banger), Pantheon (AMC, haven\u2019t watched second season yet), and stuff like that.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a huge fan of young adult content, or of the general modern style of fantasy (the trying to be gritty and edgy, having tough and masculine female protagonists, etc).

I did not really believe her at first hopefully I can give you a little sense. I got her Onyx Storm for Christmas and she really enjoyed it, for about a weekend until she finished it. Then, I told her about Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. She just finished the 5 book collection in a week while working her full-time job.</p> <p>She has read a lot of James Patterson, John Grisham, Lee Childs, and David Baldacci. She loves fantasy and action, but mostly just loves books with good plots. She is not too interested in world-building, mostly just a good story without too many explicit scenes. I would love any and all suggestions as she has exhausted most of the aforementioned authors and many other books.</p> <p>EDIT: Yes, she uses the library and e-books. She appreciates when I do a little research on these so I appreciate all the current suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",

Idk why that\u2019s just what I\u2019m in the mood of OKAY 2- a fantasy where the main plot is a \u201cquest\u201d and the main character is joined by a group of fun characters where at least one main character isn\u2019t a human. Dragons being involved is a plus. Similar to lord of the rings but more modern? 3- a fantasy that takes place in a castle. With sexy princes and a mean king. There are hundreds of these but I\u2019ve read most of them lol 4- a book (series?) similar to Bridgeton but less spice I want the DRAMAAAA okay that\u2019s all do your worst Reddit </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FlightTraditional717\"> /u/FlightTrad",

The book is dark and he is a villain that gets his way, he kills the mom with sleeping pills and finaly the brother, but as the story progresses he makes it look as everything is an accident and he is a good guy to the girl.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Okay I am a pretty picky reader my favorite book is Necessary Evil by David A. Van Meter. I am trying to read Stephen King\u2019s Salem Lot and while I continue reading I want to put it down it doesn\u2019t draw me into the story like Necessary Evil, which made me want to turn each page. I think I could convince myself to continue reading Salem\u2019s lot but just as easily be distracted by something new. Does anyone have any suggestions for a book/Author that are more in the same category of necessary evil? Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tasha_June\"> /u/Tasha_June </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1izx4ur/iso_book_to_read/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1izx4ur/iso_book_to_read/\">[comments]</a></span>",
