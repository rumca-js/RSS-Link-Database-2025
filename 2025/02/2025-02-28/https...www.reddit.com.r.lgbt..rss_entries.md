<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For my dear people all over the world, I know the world is becoming scarier right now. I know our rights are being abolished. I know we are being silenced. I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like to live in a country that is actively passing laws who hurt you as an individual. My country could be next, nobody&#39;s safe from drastic changes right now. We were already targets for the bigots before, the difference now is that they don&#39;t have to hide anymore. Everyday we fear death, torture and even rape for just existing. What did we do wrong? Absolutely nothing. We have every right to live our truth and fight for it. Please whatever you do, wherever you come from, whatever what your culture says, don&#39;t internalize all this transphobia, homophobia, sexism because you are beautiful just the way you are. My dear trans men. You&#39;re handsome. My dear trans woman. You&#39;re beautiful. My dear people whether you have a gender, multiples, none
