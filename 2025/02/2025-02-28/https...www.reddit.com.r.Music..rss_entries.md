<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The power that music has on my emotions has always been quite big, but this particular song triggers something different. It&#39;s a simple story, but I’ve never been able to get it out of my head. The song &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; by the Bee Gees was ruined for me after 9/11. </p> <p>The WTC plaza played a few calm, instrumental songs, and one of them was &quot;How Deep Is Your Love.&quot; I remember, when I was just a kid, seeing videos shot from the ground. Of the debris, the smoke and people waving out of the windows for help, all while this song was playing in the background. It was so eerie, and it’s ruined the song for me forever. </p> <p>Now, every time it comes on the radio, I feel sad. I keep thinking about how many people were trapped in those buildings and the song just keeps playing, as if nothing is happening. </p> <p>Does anyone else have a similar experience with a song?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr
