        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been comparing a few SEO tools and noticed a significant discrepancy in monthly search volume for a specific keyword between SEMrush and DataForSEO. DataForSEO apparently uses Google AdWords data, while SEMrush states they use a combination of sources. However, the difference is quite large\u201440 searches per month vs. 100. I haven&#39;t been able to confirm whether SEMrush excludes CPC data, which could explain the variance. I understand that different tools rely on distinct metrics and databases, but such inconsistencies make me question the accuracy of the search volume data. Since decisions are based on these numbers, I want to ensure I&#39;m using the most reliable source. Any insights on this would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/qwik3r\"> /u/qwik3r </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1izvrrr/semrush_data_discrepancy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",
