I enjoy Sanderson the most when I don\u2019t know everything about how the magic and gods are working. Also his prose are pretty bad compared to some of the others on this list.

It got me wondering if there are others of these Wayward Children adjacent stories hidden in other anthologies. I&#39;ve read her official WC short stories but I&#39;m making it a headcanon, and I think she would agree, that her story in this anthology is also in the Wayward Children universe. Has anyone read any of her other stories in anthologies that they think fit into the WC universe?

I\u2019ve given the wheel of time books a try and after 2 years I\u2019m finally picking up the second book but am running into the same problem where I feel like it\u2019s too unrealistic in how the characters react to their situation and environment. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t like hopeful feeling in books but I just don\u2019t like what feels like almost fake or too light hearted and when characters just feel fake. I\u2019m drawn way more to the darker reads and darker themes. I also feel more of a connection to a morally gray character but am also willing to try a story with a morally outstanding character as long as he/she goes through trauma or hardship and questions the goodness ",

Not even a single english book from Sanderson. </p> <p>After doing some research it seems that Kobo Plus wouldn&#39;t really be worth it if I want to read the more well known books. But maybe I&#39;m mistaken. It seems more worth it to just purchase separate books.</p> <p>Does anyone have more information for me, am I missing something, is Kobo Plus worth the cost in your opinion? I read 1-2 books per month on average. Would love to read more, but other obligations keep me from reading that much.</p>",

The toll of war on people\u2019s minds and morals, and especially the aftermath on the country and the innocents was difficult to read about, but an important lesson nonetheless. Although after pages of reading about misery and gore, I got a bit indifferent about it. </p> <p>My first negative is the way the main character goes from conflicted about war and hurting people, to all out psychopath. It a bit unbelievable to me. Especially her moodswings from feeling kinda guilty, to I don\u2019t care, I want power, I\u2019m the best, back to feeling guilty, had me rolling my eyes a few times and I didn\u2019t understand why some other characters kept following, and agreeing with her.</p> <p>My main negative is how a lot of conflict is set up in which our characters find themselves the underdog ",
