I have been able to compile lists of restaurants and get their home pages relatively easily, however I\u2019m at a loss for how to come up with a general solution that works for each small problem.<br/> I\u2019ve been trying to use a combination of scrapy splash and sometimes selenium. After building a few spiders in my project, I\u2019m just realizing 1) the infinite amount of differences that I\u2019ll encounter in navigating and scraping 2) the fact that any slight change will totally break each of these spiders.<br/> I\u2019ve got a kind of crazy idea to incorporate a ML model that is trained on finding menu pages from the home page, and then locating menu item, price description etc. I feel like I could use the first part for designing the scrapy request(s) and the latter for scraping info. I know this would require an almost impossible amount of annotation and labeling of exampl",
