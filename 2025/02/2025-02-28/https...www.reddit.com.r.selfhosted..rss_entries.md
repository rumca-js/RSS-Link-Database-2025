There have been quite a few posts here and there on reddit and elsewhere about android making its own DNS which makes local DNS and ad-blocking disappear. I would say I NEVER had this problem with pihole 5 but when I rolled back to it (aka turning my old pi3 back on) I found I still had the issue. Namely my Galaxy S22 and my wife&#39;s Pixel 7a create out of nothing an extra DNS that breaks things by not knowing about local DNS.

Something that would use remote cloud storage services like a NAS uses drives for example (so that if one of those services stops, that data gets automatically moved somewhere else). I have checked the awesome-self hosted list and haven&#39;t found anything that would match.

## Better Discord notifications to reduce clutter?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Right now I am sending notifications from my media server to a friends-only discord server for various events such as &quot;X requested&quot; all the way to &quot;X available&quot; events.</p> <p>It works well but the channel tends to be a bit spammy. </p> <p>The discord/webhook integrations out there for *arr apps only support adding new comments in channels. I briefly looked at other notification software out there but I could not find one that provides more fine-grain control over discord&#39;s advanced features such as threads / message editing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jugbot"> /u/Jugbot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1izvezg/better_discord_notifications_to_reduce_clutter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1izvezg/better_discord_notifications_to_reduce_clutter/">[comments]</a></span>

## Best Affordable Standalone Server for Secure Remote File Sharing & Storage (8TB–20TB, RAID 5+)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok going to try asking this.</p> <p>Starting from scratch with no existing infrastructure, what is the most affordable and cost-effective non-cloud server solution that can be deployed for at least 5+ years (with a minimum 2-year warranty)? The system must provide secure remote access over the internet (via app, virtual interface, or browser) for file sharing and storage, with read/write capabilities, access control, and edit logging. It should support at least 8TB (preferably up to 20TB) of actual usable storage with RAID 5 or better. The hardware must be new (not refurbished or second-hand) and must be a complete system—i.e., a full server (or a appropriate NAS) and HDD’s/SSD’s, rather than a setup involving a computer plus external hard drives and things added on to make it work. Sub $800 goal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/APCareServices"> /u/APCareServices </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/
