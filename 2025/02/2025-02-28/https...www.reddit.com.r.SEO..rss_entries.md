<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a local e-commerce and I basically handle all the tech/digital stuff. My background is in paid digital marketing and know enough to handle a WP + WooCommerce and site but I&#39;m not very experienced id SEO.</p> <p>This year I noticed that my sites positioning on Google started to gradually and consistently drop, from 10-12 for most of 2024 to 15-20 from november to january. So I decided to make a move and started changing content on the site, uploaded 5 blog entries and changed the category pages and product pages meta titles and descriptions and product descriptions, also deleted several old pages that weren&#39;t supposed to be published. I tried to make content more diverse as the previous ones were repetitive (I had a template and basically just changed the product name).</p> <p>The average position on Google started dropping consistently to 15 the first week, 25 the second week and now (the third) is on 35.</p> <p>Did I mess up?

## Is AI the Missing Piece in SEO or Are We Overestimating It?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AI in SEO has been evolving fast, and it&#39;s tempting to think if it is the missing piece in scaling SEO growth. With AI-driven tools, analysing search intent, automating keyword research, and optimising content structure, the content creation process has never been more efficient.<br/> One of the biggest advantage is real time content optimisation. Features like dynamic internal linking suggestions, NLP based keyword enrichment, and competitor insights keep the content efficient, valuable and competitive.<br/> That said, AI isn&#39;t about replacing human creativity. A performing content is a blend of AI insights fused with human storytelling and personal experiences to maintain originality, brand tone, and audience connection. So I believe the real question isn&#39;t if AI is the missing piece, it&#39;s how brands use it to scale their content creation and optimisation processes while maintaining quality and impact.

## SEMRush data discrepancy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been comparing a few SEO tools and noticed a significant discrepancy in monthly search volume for a specific keyword between SEMrush and DataForSEO. DataForSEO apparently uses Google AdWords data, while SEMrush states they use a combination of sources. However, the difference is quite large—40 searches per month vs. 100. I haven&#39;t been able to confirm whether SEMrush excludes CPC data, which could explain the variance. I understand that different tools rely on distinct metrics and databases, but such inconsistencies make me question the accuracy of the search volume data. Since decisions are based on these numbers, I want to ensure I&#39;m using the most reliable source. Any insights on this would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/qwik3r"> /u/qwik3r </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1izvrrr/semrush_data_discrepancy/">[link]</a></span> &#32;
