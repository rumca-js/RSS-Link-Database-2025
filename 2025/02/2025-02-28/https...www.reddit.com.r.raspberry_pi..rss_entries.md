<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Bit of a beginner, I have a RPI-4b that I&#39;m trying to do a headless setup for. So far, I&#39;ve managed to SSH into the Pi and it will return my pings however when I try to use VNCViewer to get the desktop it gives me an authentication error after entering the username and password. &quot;An authentication error occurred. See the VNC Server error log for details.&quot;. I&#39;ve tried on and off for a couple days to get past this but regardless of my attempts its still there.</p> <p>Whats really confusing me is that in one of my school projects we have another RPI-4b that was setup the same way by someone else and when connecting over wireless instead of ethernet i have no issues with VNCViewer.</p> <p>Any advice is greatly appreciated :))</p> <p>EDIT: All this is being done on a M2 Mac</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HooskyFloosky"> /u/HooskyFloosky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Would it be fine to leave a raspberry pi 3B+ on practically 24/7. It will just be on overnight and when I’m home during the day. It’s just running pi-hole but it’s the gui os version. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexMarkBartlett"> /u/AlexMarkBartlett </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1j0hypf/leaving_a_pi_on_overnight_and_all_day/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1j0hypf/leaving_a_pi_on_overnight_and_all_day/">[comments]</a></span>
