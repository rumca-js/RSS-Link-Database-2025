<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey linux users, just wanted to know your opinions about something so any comments will be appreciated. I have been living with windows for over 10 years, from windows xp to win 11 and as i learned more, i realized that windows is so bloated comparing to linux, tracks you, forces you to stuff, lots of useless services, telemetry and... but linux seems to be just like an upgraded DOS. I play games most of the time with my gaming laptop and i was wondering...</p> <p>Is it really better than windows for a gamer? Are the performances the same or maybe slightly better in linux? Whats the best linux for gaming? Am i really missing something if i don&#39;t give linux a try? And many other questions...</p> <p>Thanks everyone :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Viper_CL"> /u/Viper_CL </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j0kzk4/i_dont_know_if_i_want_to_switch/">[link]</a></span

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I fell into another rabbit hole while researching some stuff regarding KDE Plasma. I was trying out the automatic password less login, but found out that all my credentials and logins are still visible and accessible in Firefox, but not in Chromium browsers, which prompts you to unlock the wallet of the system. Seems like a huge attack vector to me, attackers can simply steal your saved passwords and cookies with a sophisticated attack with or without hardware access. In a perfect world, passwords and cookies are stored in the system wallet (or at least the master key), which is unlocked upon user login (like every other app). Chrome and Chromium browsers supports password encryption already, and even cookie encryption on Windows just recently (probably because of the many cookie stealing attempts). What is your opinion on this matter?</p> <p>Some arguments I found online: &quot;Just encrypt your whole drive!&quot;. This would protect you only fro

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the past 6 to 7 months, I gave Wayland a real shot. It was the longest I’ve ever stuck with it, and honestly, it was way more usable than my previous attempts. But over time, small issues piled up, leading me back to Xorg.</p> <p>A major frustration was Crusader, my favorite file manager, which just doesn’t work well on Wayland. I tried alternatives like Thunar and Nemo, but nothing quite replaces Crusader for me. Sure, that’s an application issue more than Wayland’s fault, but at the end of the day, I need my setup to just work.</p> <p>OBS was another pain point. Window capture would randomly break due to portal issues. Restarting the portal or switching to a different one sometimes helped, but why should I have to fight my system to do basic things?</p> <p>I also realized that Wayland’s window manager scene is lacking. Hyperland is the main option, but it’s controlled by one dev, and that worries me. There’s no real ecosystem of diverse, well-p
