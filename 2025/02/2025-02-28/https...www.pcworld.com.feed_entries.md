<p>The best webcam makes <em>you</em> look your best — for less. Most laptops ship with a 720p webcam, so a 1080p webcam or even a 4K webcam can make you stand out by comparison.</p>



<p>I haven’t tested every one of these webcams, just most of them — and I describe how I test under my recommendations. You can also refer to my separate story on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/394379/windows-hello-webcams-you-can-buy-right-now.html">best Windows Hello webcams</a> for recommendations that aid videoconferencing <em>and</em> log you into your PC.

But as any casual glance at the news will tell you, laws don’t apply if no one is enforcing them. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is taking a fresh look at this annoying issue, with an eye to expanding enforcement to streaming services.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-409843A1.pdf">a press release yesterday</a> (PDF), the FCC is inviting public comment on proposed rules to expand its enforcement of the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/enforcement/areas/sound-volume-commercials-calm-act">CALM Act of 2012</a>, wherein Congress codified the law that stopped commercials from blasting at higher and higher volumes relative to the scheduled programming around them.
