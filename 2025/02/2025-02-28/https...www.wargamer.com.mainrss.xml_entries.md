								<p>There’s a brand new <strong>Pokémon Pocket</strong> set, Triumphant Light, out today and of course the biggest chase card for this release is the one slap bang on the front of all the packs: Arceus Ex. What’s really interesting about Arceus, though, is not the card itself, but the enormous number of other cards that are designed to support this Pokémon deity.</p>
