I built an AI dream interpreter on WhatsApp that uses classical interpretations from Ibn Sirin, a renowned 8th-century Islamic dream scholar, as its knowledge base.</p> <p>Key features: • Tradition meets tech: It uses Ibn Sirin’s traditional dream interpretation framework, offering insights with a rich historical foundation. • Easy to use: Just send a message describing your dream via WhatsApp, and you’ll receive an interpretation in seconds. • Free interpretations: Enjoy 5 free dream interpretations per month with no fees or sign-ups required. • Private &amp; convenient: Your dream remains private in a one-on-one WhatsApp chat, like texting a knowledgeable friend who’s available 24/7.</p> <p>I tried it with a couple of my own dreams, and the interpretations were surprisingly insightful and aligned with what I know from Islamic dream literature.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’ve never really enjoyed analyzing my chess games, but I know it&#39;s a crucial part in getting better. I feel like the reason I hate analysis is because I often don’t actually understand the best move, despite the engine insisting it’s correct. Most engines just show &quot;Best Move&quot;, highlight an eval bar, and move on. But they don’t explain what went wrong or why I made a mistake in the first place.</p> <p>That’s what got me thinking: What if game review felt as easy as chatting with a coach? So I&#39;ve been building an LLM-powered chess analysis tool that:</p> <ul> <li>Finds the turning points in your game automatically.</li> <li>Explains WHY a move was bad, instead of just showing the best one.</li> <li>Lets you chat with an AI to ask questions about your mistakes.</li> </ul> <p>Honestly, seeing my critical mistakes explained in plain English (not just eval bars) made game analysis way more fun—and actually useful.</

And I know what you&#39;re thinking—wow, another one of these? Well, yes, it is another one, but this one is different. Most video downloaders just take you to a third-party site to download the video (especially on Firefox), so I figured, with my programming knowledge, I&#39;d just make my own simple 1-click solution.</p> <p>And well, here it is! I&#39;m still working on it, and there are a few more features in the backlog waiting to be comple

## YC’s Co-Founder Matching Sucks – Let’s Build Something Better

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Alright, I hate Y Combinator’s Co-Founder Matching, and I know I’m not alone. It’s supposed to help you find a co-founder, but instead, it’s just a time-wasting, frustrating mess. Here’s why it sucks:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Too many ghosters</strong> – People sign up, chat for a bit, and then disappear. If I wanted to be ignored, I’d just text my crush.</li> <li><strong>Idea dictators</strong> – Half the people there don’t actually want a co-founder, they want a free employee to build <em>their</em> vision.</li> <li><strong>Zero real filters</strong> – It’s impossible to tell who’s actually serious, who has the skills, or if they’re even real.</li> <li><strong>More LinkedIn than Tinder</strong> – Finding a co-founder is like dating. But YC’s platform is like filling out a boring job application instead of actually <em>connecting</em> with someone.</li> </ul> <p>I think we can do <strong>way better.</strong> If enough people fill out this <strong>quic
