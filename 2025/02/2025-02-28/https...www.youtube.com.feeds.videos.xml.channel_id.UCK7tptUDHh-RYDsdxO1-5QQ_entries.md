Many provisions of President Trump’s signature 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democrats warn that extending the cuts will come at the expense of programs that help Americans, with the Committee for a Responsible Budget estimating that Trump’s tax priorities would reduce government revenues between $5-11 trillion over 10 years. So how have the cuts affected individuals and businesses since 2017?

WSJ spoke to three economists who specialize in corporate taxes, pass-through business taxes and taxes for individuals about the fiscal impact of the cuts.
