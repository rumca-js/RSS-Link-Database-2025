            <p>With the release of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows11arm64">Windows 11 for Arm ISO</a>, it's easier than ever to get an officially-supported install of Windows on many different Arm PCsâ€”now including a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://worproject.com/">Windows on R</a> seems like it has run out of steam, as many open source initiatives do, after years of being bludgeoned with support requests being the only way to really get Windows going on a Pi.</p>

<p>But GitHub user (and <em>high-schooler</em>) Botspot just emailed me his <a href="https://github.com/Botspot/bvm">BVM</a> project, short for 'Botspot Virtual Machine'.</p>
