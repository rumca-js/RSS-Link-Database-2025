<p>Fifteen minutes after “hanging up” with Sesame’s new “lifelike” AI, and I’m still freaked out.</p>



<p>So-called “conversations” with AI don’t do a lot for me, especially where text is concerned. With voice chats, such as the new options for Google Gemini and Microsoft’s Copilot, all voice does is save some typing. While Google and Microsoft designed its assistants to be helpful, they’re not especially personable — or sometimes, they’re just artificially cheery.</p>



<p>Sesame’s model, however, is a simple one: “We believe in a future where computers are lifelike,” according to the company’s mission statement. </p>



<p>Sesame wants to build an AI companion, with a natural human voice. Eventually, it wants to design realistic eyewear to put that companion right in your ear, and let it see what you do. It’s very much in keeping with the movie <em>Her</

<p>Good monitors don’t have to cost a ton, as this Asus TUF model proves. Now available for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-VG27AQ1A-Supports-Compatible-DisplayPort/dp/B08CZ8QJTX/">new best price of $169 on Amazon</a>, that’s a 32 percent discount that makes it all the more affordable.</p>

<p>The Acer Nitro V is consistently up there as one of the best-selling gaming laptops, mainly because it packs hearty gaming parts into a low-priced package. Today, Target is offering one of its most affordable variants for even less, giving you a Ryzen 7 7735HS octa-core processor, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 4060 GPU <a href="https://www.target.com/p/acer-nitro-v-15-15-6-gaming-notebook-full-hd-amd-ryzen-7-7735hs-16-gb-1-tb-ssd-english-keyboard-black-manufacturer-refurbished/-/A-93593156">for just $624.99</a>.</p>



<p>This version of the 15-inch laptop is refurbished, but according to the listing, it comes with Acer’s standard 1-year warranty (which means that Acer did the refurbishing). For $305 off its original retail price, I’d say that’s a pretty good trade-off. The base 16GB of RAM and 1TB SSD are already pretty generous for any gaming laptop under a gr

<p>If you’re like me, I bet your desk is overcrowded with power strips, chargers, and too many cables. If so, then this Anker charging station will solve a lot of that for you — and it won’t cost you much at all.</p>



<p>Right now, Anker’s 6-device charging station is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charging-Station-Included/dp/B0CM6V5GL2/">on sale for $30 on Amazon</a>. That’s a nice 25 percent off its original $40 MSRP!</p>



<p>This tiny little charging block has six ports for charging up to six devices at a time. That means you’ll only need one outlet for six phones, tablets, laptops, and whatever else — you can toss the rest of your chargers in a drawer and forget about them. This thing has three USB-C ports (one 30W and two 20W) and three USB-A ports (one 18W and two 12W), and you can assign them however you wish.</p>

<p>Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is one of the most popular ChromeOS devices around, thanks to its Surface-style tablet form factor, small size, and even smaller price. The latest model is currently on sale with a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/156612234603">refurbished unit on eBay for just $259.99</a>. That’s $130 off the original price — and it’s the upgraded model with 8GB of RAM, too.</p>



<p>This newest model Chromebook Duet is an 11-inch tablet powered by ChromeOS, and it includes a kickstand and a keyboard cover in the box. It’s a fantastic alternative to Microsoft’s Surface Go, delivering excellent value, surprisingly good typing, and a battery that’ll last you all day (or two or three) thanks to its Arm-based hardware. The upgraded 8GB of RAM in this version is an important extra, since even Chromebooks tend to chug if you overload them with browser

Between pent-up demand from PC gamers and Nvidia selling every GPU it can to the bubbling AI industry, new models are going out of stock in a matter of minutes — and it looks like the situation isn’t going to improve any time soon, as the biggest AI company around wants even more hardware.</p>



<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1895203654103351462">the social network formerly known as Twitter</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-has-run-out-of-gpus-says-sam-altman-gpt-4-5-rollout-delayed-due-to-lack-of-processing-power">Tom’s Hardware</a>) to say that OpenAI’s ChatGPT version 4.5 is re

<p>We’re not just talking a few devices, mind you. Oh no, Amazon goes <em>big </em>at these events, aiming a firehose of products at the quivering journalists in attendance. The parade goes at a breathless pace, one after another, so fast that you can barely keep up. </p>

<p>A webcam is indispensable for video conferencing. However, other applications can also access the camera, which means there’s a potential risk that a malicious intruder is in the system and watching your every move. Creepy. If you don’t need the camera or want to deny access to other people using the computer, you’ll want to make a change to the registry.</p>

<p>Encrypting your system’s hard drive is a great way to protect your laptop if it ever gets stolen. During the encryption process, readable data (aka plain text) is converted into unreadable character strings (aka cipher text). Only with the correct password can you reverse this process and restore the original data. It acts as a digital lock that prevents unwanted access to sensitive information.</p>

<p>AMD shuffled Radeon’s branding this generation to mirror Nvidia’s; the Radeon RX 9070 XT will thus compete with the RTX 5070 Ti, while the Radeon RX 9070 takes aim at the 9070.</p>



<p>Normally, I’d infuse this preview with analysis and commentary, but AMD declined to share 9070 pricing with press in a pre-announcement briefing. It’ll be revealed in the company’s Radeon RX 9070 stream this morning. Since pricing is so crucial to the story of the Radeon RX 9070, I’ll skip most

<p>A lot of attention gets spent on the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3219792/best-antivirus-for-windows-pc.html">best paid antivirus suites</a>, but free antivirus solutions are worth discussion, too. After all, free versions are based on their paid counterparts.</p>



<p>Good news is, when you see a free alternative to a paid version you like, you can safely assume the antivirus protection level is similar—save for any specific malware types the free version doesn’t cover. The bigger difference is the number of features available to you.</p>



<p>To create this list of the top free antivirus programs, we looked at the top mainstream antivirus suites for Windows and selected the ones that offer a free version, as not all of them do. Then we looked at how well these suites performed in third-party detection tests. We also made sure they weren’t r
