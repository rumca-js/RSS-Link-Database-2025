Jeremy Strong was a significant feature of my primary school years with his 100 Mile an Hour Dog series and also My Brother&#39;s Famous Bottom series. He was an author who brought much joy to young children from (particularly) the early 90s onwards with his silly humour. His final work Fox Goes North which was published posthumously is apparently more sombre than his previous works.

At first, I found it to be a cozy yet fairly predictable read, seemingly geared towards young adults. But then I reached the part where Sal first agrees to show Linus his room and the latter helps him move his writing setup\u2014and everything changed. From that moment on, I was completely captivated, unable to put it down. </p> <p>Another highlight in the book that left a gag in my throat was when Arthur changes in front of the crowd to protect Linus. </p> <p>There were many more passages that left my eyes misty and my lips curled into a smile (though, to be fair, I do tear up easily!). This book is the perfect escape into a fantasy world that\u2019s warm, fuzzy, and filled with heart.
