<p>Donatella’s references to brother Gianni’s last collection in her latest show fuel rumours of possible departure</p><p>It is not just the dresses on the Versace catwalk that are for sale this Milan fashion week, but Versace itself. One of the most glamorous names in fashion is up for grabs, with Prada, its longtime rival for Milan bragging rights, thought to be close to purchasing the company. The prospect of a sale raises the question of whether Donatella, designer since the death of her brother in 1997, will remain as creative lead.</p><p>Versace without Donatella is hard to imagine. She remains a hands-on designer, and the lightning rod through which Versace’s energy is conducted. “Everyone should have a little Versace attitude,” she said before this show, held under the iron shelter of a historic tram depot in Milan where, as a concession to guest’s skimpy outfits, the benches were heated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/28/milano-fashion-week-not-jus

<p>Tennis has been awash for nearly 60 years with stellar rivalries, especially on the men’s side. But it’s becoming clear the next great one might not be around the corner</p><p>The Australian Open exists on its own in the tennis calendar at the start of the year – not really connected to what came before or what ensues immediately after; it’s nearly five months removed from both the US Open that precedes it and the French Open that follows it. For most followers of the sport, the real start of the calendar year tennis season, for both men and women, is the PNB Paribas event at Indian Wells, which starts on Wednesday. Long considered the sport’s “fifth slam”, the tournament starts a torrid nonstop stretch of seven months of intense competition. As this long winter slowly loses its grip on the country, fans will revel in watching the best men and women competing under the hot desert sun.</p><p>But, unfortunately, the men’s side of the draw will be somewhat lacking because of the abse

<p><strong>(Krets)<br></strong>Anders Hana, Olva Christer Rossebø and Åshild Vetrhus take inspiration from Norway’s rugged Rogaland in these tracks sourced from early-to-mid 20th century recordings</p><p>A new Norwegian folk label, Krets, arrives with an arresting debut release – an “anarchistic” set of songs, dances, ballads and psalms from the rugged south-western county of Rogaland.</p><p>Malmin, a duo of experimental musician Anders Hana and folk-rock and cajun-pop instrumentalist Olav Christer Rossebø, write in their album’s liner notes of the Rogaland elders whose performance style inspired them, and how “their hunt to resonate with the depth of the human soul spared no means”. Fittingly, these nine tracks largely sound like deliciously diabolical spells. Some are scraped on eight-string harding fiddles, others plucked or picked on mouth-harps, microtonal mandolins and guitars, where extra frets help the musicians play the tones between semitones. All are sourced from early-to-

<p>For the first time in English, the sensational memoirs of Josephine Baker – cabaret star, activist and spy</p><p>‘Who else could ever have had a story like hers?” writes Ijeoma Oluo in the foreword to Josephine Baker’s memoir<em>. </em>“The dancer, the singer, the ingenue, the scandal maker, the activist, the spy – Josephine Baker lived at least 10 lives in one.” Translated gorgeously into English for the first time by Anam Zafar and Sophie Lewis, Fearless and Free comprises stories and reflections in Baker’s own voice, drawn from conversations with the French writer Marcel Sauvage that began in 1926 and continued for more than 20 years afterwards. They cover her early life in St Louis, her adventures in Europe and eventual transformation into, as Sauvage puts it, an “actress and French citizen of worldwide renown”.</p><p>Memoirs that span a lifetime can lack narrative drive. “Life, when you think about it later,” says Baker, “is a series of images … a film in your heart.” And yet

Later, from the backseat of the presidential limousine, AKA The Beast, he paced the 41-car field around the oval track before the race. The sight of that 20,000lb machine sticking to the track’s banked lanes at 70 mph blew away the crowd all over again. “This is your favorite president,” he told the drivers via their in-car radio system. “I’m a really big fan of you people. You’re talented people and great people and great Americans.” The shock and awe spectacle couldn’t have been more fitting of a man who has been taking the country f

<p>The mercurial boxing savant returns to Brooklyn on Saturday with another big payday and signature knockout expected. But the real question is what comes next</p><p>Gervonta Davis leaned back from the microphone, a slow grin creeping onto his face, brimming with the earned confidence of a man who’s seen this all before. “You know what I come to do, man,” the World Boxing Association’s lightweight champion said. “You know why I’m here. I don’t want to say too much. [His mother] is over there in the corner. Got to keep it polite, but y’all know: <em>fireworks</em>.”</p><p>It was the same styling of laconic menace he’s dispensed at nearly every press conference before his fights, and yet it still sent a quiet ripple through the Barclays Center atrium on Thursday afternoon. Because when Davis says it, history has shown he’s standing on business. Thirty bouts, 30 wins, 28 knockouts. World titles at 130lb, 135lb and 140lb while selling out arenas from coast to coast. There’s a reason why

<p>This 1980s-set debut novel takes place over 24 hours as the ripple effects of a teacher’s death are explored</p><p>Dark Like Under, Alice Chadwick’s ambitious and affecting debut novel, begins and ends at midnight. The 24 hours in&nbsp;between, while at times sunlit and sweltering, hang heavy with the shadow cast by the night before.</p><p>That shadow is the death of Mr Ardennes. The story is set in England in the 1980s and it begins with Robin and Jonah, two teenagers at the local grammar school, bumping into Mr Ardennes, a well-liked teacher at the school. It is Sunday night – or Monday morning – and they have slipped away from a party. They meet on the banks of the weir, where he is taking one of his regular late night walks, and exchange pleasantries. He appears distracted. “He looked a bit rough,” observes Jonah. His hands seem oddly heavy in his pockets, “like weights”. At the next morning’s school assembly, his death is announced.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/bo
