<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following a project called Plebbit, which is building a decentralized, censorship-resistant alternative to Reddit, and I wanted to get your thoughts on its architecture and technical design. They&#39;ve recently released a client called Seedit, that aims to replicate the old.reddit UI, but on a fully peer-to-peer foundation.</p> <p>What Makes it Different:</p> <p>Unlike traditional social media platforms, or even federated alternatives like Mastodon, Plebbit is designed to be truly P2P. It&#39;s built on top of IPFS and libp2p, so there are no central servers, no single points of failure, and (in theory) no way to censor or shut down communities. It&#39;s a completely different approach compared to the likes of Farcaster and nostr that rely on hubs or relays, as Plebbit aims to connect peers directly and automatically.</p> <p>Key Technical Aspects:</p> <p>* Content Addressing (IPFS): All content (posts, comments, subplebbit data) is ide

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/programming">r/programming</a> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We recently cooked up a small TypeScript utility that tackles an old database annoyance: ordering lists without tedious reindexing or conflict checks.</p> <p>What‚Äôs the problem? Think of inserting an item into the middle of a big list. If you store positions as integers, you might have to shuffle every index downstream. We wanted a simpler solution‚Äîone that yields O(1) insertion and deletion with minimal friction.</p> <p>Our approach- order as strings: Instead of integer indexes, each list item gets a ‚Äústamp‚Äù‚Äîa string that‚Äôs infinitely splittable. So you can insert new stamps ‚Äúbetween‚Äù existing ones without renumbering the whole list.</p> <p>Core functions: - start() and end() generate stamps for adding items at the beginning or end of your list. - between(stampA, stampB) generates a new stamp between two existing ones.</p> <p>Practical upshot: You store these strings in a DB column, sort by them, a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For example, i seen a book called Data Cartels: The companies that control and monopolize our information by Sarah Lamdan. Havent read it yet but from the reviews it seems to keep us well informed about how important data is to a lot of businesses. Is there any books that you would recommend of similar ilk? It can be any genre really as long as the theme is anything tech. Interested to hear the responses!
