<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Idk if this is the right sub to ask this as it&#39;s a legit copy of windows 11 but I figured if anyone would know it&#39;d be you people. (Since unlocking windows features or disabling windows crap by alternative means is in your wheelhouse)</p> <p>How do I make windows 11 stop prompting me to &quot;Finish Setting up your device&quot;? </p> <p>I use my PC for gaming only and am not gonna use office, onedrive, homegroup or any of that crap ever. </p> <p>How to I stop getting prompted every three days? (it breaks some games&#39; fullscreen when it pops up requiring a relaunch)</p> <p>And please... Do NOT tell me to switch to linux. I prefer windows&#39; simplicity in things like modding or piracy. And I do not care that linux can be anything you want it to be and gives you more control. It&#39;s less streamlined and I&#39;m not interested. (Now... If it came with Xenia as a wife.
