So while the left believes the compassionate thing to do is to allow the opposite sex to steal titles away from women, it is a slap in the face to female rights everyone. </p><p>One teen athlete is speaking out after her school began investigating her for allegedly “misgendering” a trans athlete, aka a dude.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Washington teen refuses to compete against trans basketball player, faces civil rights complaint <a href="https://t.co/S3J3Ra6c9E">https://t.co/S3J3Ra6c9E</a><br/>— Fox News (@FoxNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1895374099179782194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2025</a></blockqu

Thus, racism was relabeled as “equity” and progressives jumped on that bandwagon as if that was the morally superior thing to do. However, one of the big issues with that is that it’s not legal to discriminate just because you don’t like how light or dark someone's skin color is. Thus, one high school in Minnesota learned the hard way after being forced to cancel a “no-whites” student field trip.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Minnesota high school forced to cancel no-whites student trip after civil rights complaint <a href="https://t.co/dPBWJYJNxi">https://t.co/dPBWJYJNxi</a><br/>— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mail

Get the f*ck out of here with that. Don't even put it out into the universe. Jennings is much more valuable as the lone voice of reason on CNN than as a junior US Senator. If not for Scottso, the tens of people who watch CNN might be led to believe the Commander-in-Chief doesn't control the military, and the Bureaucratic Branch of government supersedes the other three branches of government... that ackshually are the branches of government.</p><p>You know how we got here. Progressive non-profits funded by progressive billionaires get a progressive professor or two to claim we are in a constitutional crisis, which lets the New York Times claim "experts" are saying Trump is causing a constitutional crisis, which lets Democrats and the media (

Earlier this month, Vance told an audience of Europeans how much they su-diddly-uck when it comes to protecting citizens' free speech. A reporter asked if JD wanted to repeat any of it to Starmer's face.</p><p>Here's one of the clips in question.
