I really enjoyed the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings (especially the Hobbit). Other books I‚Äôve enjoyed are the Wingfeather Saga (everything about it was great). Some non-book media I‚Äôve really enjoyed as well is Avatar (the Last Airbender), Hilda (Netflix), the Legend of Zelda (Majora‚Äôs Mask was a banger), Pantheon (AMC, haven‚Äôt watched second season yet), and stuff like that.</p> <p>I‚Äôm not a huge fan of young adult content, or of the general modern style of fantasy (the trying to be gritty and edgy, having tough and masculine female protagonists, etc). I‚Äôm also not the biggest fan of sci-fi, but I have enjoyed it in the past, so if you have some great recommendations, I‚Äôd like those.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/queilef"> /u/queilef </a> <br/

I got her Onyx Storm for Christmas and she really enjoyed it, for about a weekend until she finished it. Then, I told her about Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. She just finished the 5 book collection in a week while working her full-time job.</p> <p>She has read a lot of James Patterson, John Grisham, Lee Childs, and David Baldacci. She loves fantasy and action, but mostly just loves books with good plots. She is not too interested in world-building, mostly just a good story without too many explicit scenes. I would love any and all suggestions as she has exhausted most of the aforementioned authors and many other books.</p> <p>EDIT: Yes, she uses the library and e-books.

## Novels on immigration and multiculturalism - but from the "native" perspective?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read plenty of books that deal with immigration and multiculturalism from the standpoint of the migrant or 2nd generation migrant and their emotional universe. I am just wandering if there are any interesting novels that deal with similar themes but from the perspective of the &#39;native&#39; (for lack of a better phrase) and how they deal with and interact with immigrants and newcomers in their neighbourhood. The closest I can think of is perhaps Michel Houellebecq&#39;s Submission. Other than that there&#39;s virtually none that I can think of.</p> <p>I&#39;m clearly not interested in white supremacist propaganda, but interesting stories that deal with these themes in a nuanced, interesting and engaging manner. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blackjacobin_97"> /u/blackjacobin_97 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggest

His mom is kind of sad about it. He is actually nothing to the girl, she is the sister of his friend, he is also wealthier than them. As the story progresses we know that he got near his friend because he was a super weird child and got obssesed with her when they were kids, so he couldn&#39;t just play with her he got close to the brother to always be near her. The book is dark and he is a villain that gets his way, he kills the mom with sleeping pills and finaly the brother, but as the story progresses he makes it look as everything is an accident and he is a good guy to the girl. I do also remember there was something about doing something to a girl (not mfc) using her brother to make it look like it was the bro the one that was a crazy killer
