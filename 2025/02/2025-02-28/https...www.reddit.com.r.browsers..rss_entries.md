<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me Firefox is the best browser, it has allowed me to have a unique user experience with exclusive features such as user.css, plus we all know that it is the only way to escape the monopoly of Chromium. I&#39;ve been a Firefox user since 2010 but I feel like this time the death of the browser is near and without Firefox the Internet will become whatever Google and Big tech wants (Brave will not save you).</p> <p>I don&#39;t know to what extent it will be possible to sustain the development of Firefox if Mozilla abandons it, but I think it&#39;s important that users unite and support the fork that is most ready to support. It&#39;s not just Gecko, but the mobile app and extension store, as well as the synchronization system that needs to be rescued (I think a p2p alternative without a centralized server might be a good option).</p> <p>What do you think? What fork could be a good candidate?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="

But it&#39;s been hard finding android alternatives.</p> <p>Practically none of the Firefox forks are available for android, and the one I found had a subscription behind it.</p> <p>I liked Arc for a while, but fell out of it due to how its tab management and bookmarks are set up.</p> <p>Brave seemed promising, but it feels a bit too cluttered, and I didn&#39;t want to deal with its whole crypto thing.</p> <p>I used DuckDuckGo before moving to Firefox, but I left it because of its lackluster search results.</p> <p>Vivaldi had potential, but it&#39;s similar to Brave. Too cluttered.</p> <p>I&#39;m considering moving to Opera, but I&#39;m concerned about some spyware allegations, which I&#39;m not sure whether or not actually have anything behind them.</p> <p>So, is there some alternative I&#39;ve yet to find?
