<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a better term for this, but in a few pieces of media I&#39;ve consumed there&#39;s a point in the story where there&#39;s a major world-changing shift (not a gradual change or a cataclysm so much as a grand reveal or unlocking of something that previously existed) that has a big impact on not just the characters but their society as a whole, are there any good examples of this in fantasy? In other media the ones that come to mind are The Expanse and Attack on Titan. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HackingYourUmwelt"> /u/HackingYourUmwelt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j0l9zt/booksseries_with_a_topology_change/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j0l9zt/booksseries_with_a_topology_change/">[comments]</a></span>

It‚Äôs objectively reasonably fine with a lot to like, even if it does suffer from a serious identity crisis.

Given that servants are seen more as furniture than people, it feels hopeless, until one day she runs into a faerie.

Each duology/trilogy will be from the point of view of 1 character and all will take place in the same world, just in different places or different points in time.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always felt more comfortable writing in first person. For me personally, it&#39;s more natural. On top of that, I do like feeling like I&#39;m in the story instead of just observing. The only time I use third person is when the POV character is knocked out for some reason so for a short time, the POV would have to be from someone else. Though I rarely do this.</p> <p>But recently, I learned that there are some people who think first person is overrated? Like I&#39;ve heard publishers prefer third person and third person is actually preferred in fantasy writing (though I guess not always, ACOTAR was in first person, I think, but still)? I read one article where they said third person was professional and firs

## Fantasy books on kobo plus

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When my mother passed away I inherited her Kobo e-reader. Now that I&#39;ve finished WOT (which was in my local library) I&#39;m looking to move more towards using the e-reader. Want to have the benefits of the ease of use, compared to constantly having to hold a 1.000 pages thick book.</p> <p>Now my library has a really bad online selection of books. For example, there&#39;s only a collection of 7 Sanderson books in Dutch (I&#39;m from the Netherlands). Not even a single english book from Sanderson. </p> <p>After doing some research it seems that Kobo Plus wouldn&#39;t really be worth it if I want to read the more well known books. But maybe I&#39;m mistaken. It seems more worth it to just purchase separate books.</p> <p>Does anyone have more information for me, am I missing something, is Kobo Plus worth the cost in your opinion? I read 1-2 books per month on average. Would love to read more, but other obligations keep me from reading that much.</p>

The toll of war on people‚Äôs minds and morals, and especially the aftermath on the country and the innocents was difficult to read about, but an important lesson nonetheless. Although after pages of reading about misery and gore, I got a bit indifferent about it. </p> <p>My first negative is the way the main character goes from conflicted about war and hurting people, to all out psychopath. It a bit unbelievable to me.
