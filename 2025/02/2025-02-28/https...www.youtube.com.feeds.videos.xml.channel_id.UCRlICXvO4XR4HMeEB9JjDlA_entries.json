        "description": "The Wandering Albatross, a majestic creature, is sadly no stranger to a spot of trouble \u2013 courtesy of longline fishing and plastic pollution. They often mistake plastic for lunch, feed it to their chicks, and, well, end up with a one-way ticket to oblivion. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, they frequently get tangled in fishing hooks, only to drown in the process. Truly tragic, really. Yet, despite all this, the Albatross continues to inspire tales of wonder and defiance, reminding us that even when life throws a million challenges our way, we can always pause for a moment and marvel at the bird gliding effortlessly over the ocean, proving that limits are clearly for the birds\u2026",
