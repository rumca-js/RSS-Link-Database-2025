Brought to you by Raycon.\n\n\n#monkeyman #johnwick #videoessay #keanureeves \n\n\nEveryone\u2019s comparing Dev Patel\u2019s Monkey Man to Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick\u2014but are they really the same? In this deep dive, we break down the brutal action, fight choreography, and cinematic style that set these two films apart.\n\nFrom Chad Stahelski\u2019s sleek gun-fu to Dev Patel\u2019s raw, visceral combat, both films deliver high-intensity action but with completely different flavors. We\u2019ll explore how stunt work, cinematography, and fight direction shape their unique identities and why Monkey Man is NOT just another John Wick copycat.",
