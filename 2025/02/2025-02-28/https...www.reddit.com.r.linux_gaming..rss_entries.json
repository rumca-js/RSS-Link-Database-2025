It would open up a window and then disappear while still running in the background OR just straight up freeze everything once the window loaded. This happened across Proton GE 9_25, Experimental and Hotfix. i did try some older GE versions aswell but APPARENTLY and i just learned this each Proton version counts as a &quot;new pc&quot; in the eyes of denuvo. So currently i am now locked out of attempting any fixes for Wilds for 24 hours. Does anyone have any suggestions on how i could potentially fix my crashing that i could try once the denuvo anti tamper is up? btw i have an amd gpu and tried setting amdvlk in the steam launch settings but that did nothing, no pc or window crashing, but just a black screen eternally.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",

Most are preforming well, with some requiring some working a little better than others (Ubuntu is great but FPS is definitely lacking when compared to the others) Been using openSUSE for a bit and... it just works and the performance is about the same as Cachy and Bazzite. I&#39;m very surprised by it, it&#39;s got rollback features, the Yast system makes system admin super easy, it&#39;s rolling release, very stable, can use flatpak, and surprisingly can use pacman. Gaming wise I just added the Nvidia repos for proprietary drivers and frame gen, DLSS, and HDR are all working! Really feels like the good parts of ARCH and Fedora mixed into one.</p> <p>Oh and it&#39;s not really important for gaming but those of us that run multiple OS&#39;s the bootloader detects the other OS&#39;s and adds it to the boot menu automatically.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",
