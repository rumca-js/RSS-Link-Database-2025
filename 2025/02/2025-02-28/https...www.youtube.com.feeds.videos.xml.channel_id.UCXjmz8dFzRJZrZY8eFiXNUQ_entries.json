        "description": "The Academy Awards\u2014better known as The Oscars\u2014have long been considered the most prestigious honor in Hollywood. Every year, the best films, actors, and directors compete for cinematic glory. But as viewership declined and blockbuster films gained dominance, the Academy made a desperate attempt to stay relevant\u2014introducing a fan-voted award to recognize popular films.  To say this decision was controversial would be an understatement. Oscar purists and industry insiders rejected the idea, while the general audience was left unimpressed. After one disastrous run, the award was quietly scrapped, never to be seen again.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Do you think the Oscars should bring back a fan-voted category?
