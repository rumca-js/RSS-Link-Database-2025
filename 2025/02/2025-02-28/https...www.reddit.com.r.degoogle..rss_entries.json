My current phone is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, but I won&#39;t have it much longer anyway. I&#39;d really prefer a smaller phone which is why I like the Unihertz Jelly Max but I&#39;m not sure how to degoogle that. I was also looking at the fairphone 4 e/os because of it being completely degoogled and more private. If anyone has the fairphone I&#39;d like to hear about your experiences. Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chaotic0range\"> /u/Chaotic0range </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1j03exb/is_there_anyway_to_degoogle_a_jelly_phone_max_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1j03exb/is_there_anyway_to_degoogle_a_jelly_phone_max_or/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Don\u2019t come for me I\u2019m honestly asking because I\u2019m trying to be more cognizant of what I\u2019m using these days. Hence why I\u2019m joining this subreddit. I have deleted all my google. Used duckduckgo for a month and decided I hate her and now I\u2019m using qwant. Any suggestions for a smooth exit with gmail?
