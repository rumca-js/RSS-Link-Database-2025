<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Suppose I&#39;m in a site A which makes a ajax request to site B then this one set me a cookie inside site A, can site A read my cookie or just site B? If so can any subdomain from A,B read my cookies? it&#39;s very badly explained, if just site B can read it why is third party cookies &quot;That bad&quot;?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-District-2098"> /u/Ok-District-2098 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1j0cgsu/what_kind_of_domain_can_actually_read_a_third/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1j0cgsu/what_kind_of_domain_can_actually_read_a_third/">[comments]</a></span>
