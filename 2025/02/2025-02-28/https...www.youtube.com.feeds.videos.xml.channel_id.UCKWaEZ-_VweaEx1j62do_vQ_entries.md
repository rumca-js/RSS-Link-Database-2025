Granite 3.2 is officially here! In episode 44 of Mixture of Experts, host Tim Hwang is joined by Kate Soule, Maya Murad and Kaoutar El Maghraoui to debrief a few big AI announcements. Last week we covered small vision-language models (VLMs), and this week Granite 3.2 dropped with  new VLMs, enhanced reasoning capabilities, and more! Kate takes us under the hood to understand the new features and how they were created. Next, Anthropic dropped a new intelligence model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and a new agentic coding tool, Claude Code. Why did Anthropic release these separately? Then, as we cannot have an episode without covering agents, Maya takes us through the new BeeAI agents! Finally, can fine tuning on a malicious task lead to much broader misalignment? Our experts analyze a new paper released on ‘Emergent misalignment.’ All that and more on this week's episode!
