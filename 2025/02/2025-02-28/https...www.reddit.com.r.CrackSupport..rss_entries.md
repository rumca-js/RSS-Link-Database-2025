I had to buy rdr2 on sale for a friend but my card declined, and now that it isn&#39;t on sale anymore none of us has enough money to spend on it. I was wondering if somebody might have known of a safe website where he could download it for free without getting any type of malware, spyware or viruses in general.</p> <p>I already know about some websites: Koyso, Steamunlocked and Steamrip, that were classified as safe websites from a lot of other people here on reddit. I was wondering if they are REALLY safe, though, or if there is a safer website with as many games as the ones I just mentioned, because I really do not want my friend to get a virus because of me ahahah. Anyway, if somebody knows something I&#39;d be very thankful if you told me!!!! Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puciapiciu"> /u/Puciapiciu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd
