Its team talk rage, panic attacks and being bowled over by a 14-year-old</p><p>The first few minutes of Netflix\u2019s new drama Adolescence are among the most incredible you will ever see. Two police officers drive to a house, smash its doors in, sweep from room to room and apprehend a teenage boy suspected of murdering a female classmate. They load him into a van, drive to a police station then process him for arrest.</p><p>On the surface this sounds like any workaday drama, but the incredible thing about Adolescence is this: the whole sequence is conducted in one take. From car to house to van to station, the camera never leaves the action. Even more incredibly, the entire series follows in kind. There are four episodes, each without a single edit.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/28/is-this-the-most-terrifying-tv-show-of-our-times-adolescence-the-drama-that-will-horrify-a",
