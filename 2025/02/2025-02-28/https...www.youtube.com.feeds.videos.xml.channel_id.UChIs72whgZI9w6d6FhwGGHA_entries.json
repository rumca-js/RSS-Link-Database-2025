        "description": "Sponsor: Thermaltake Tower 600 Case on Amazon https://geni.us/wjtN\nAMD has, for a second time now, announced its RX 9070 and 9070 XT -- but this time, we have prices. The AMD RX 9070 will be a 56 CU card priced at $550, with the RX 9070 XT $50 higher at $600 total, creating only a $50 gap between them. The 9070 XT is a 64 CU card, the two have the same VRAM capacity at 16GB, and power is about 80W apart. We'll have full benchmarks and reviews of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT soon, including testing against the NVIDIA RTX 5070, 5070 Ti, 5080, 5090, and plenty of prior generation GPUs from both AMD and NVIDIA (and now also Intel). Release date for the AMD RX 9070 and 9070 XT RDNA 4 GPUs is March 6, 2025. The release date for the RTX 5070 is March 5, 2025.\n\nWatch our \"AMD, Don't Screw This Up\" video about the pricing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekKQyrgkd3c\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
