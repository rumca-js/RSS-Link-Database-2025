Amazon dominates the book industryâ€”from eBooks and audiobooks to print sales and self-publishing. Big thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring today's video. Be sure to checkout https://www.squarespace.com/danielgreene But behind its convenience is a monopoly thatâ€™s hurting authors, publishers, and readers. From slashing royalties and manipulating algorithms to downgrading Kindles and removing ownership of digital books, Amazonâ€™s grip on the industry is making reading worse for everyone.
