Very long. Backside-numbingly long. Which is as you might expect of a decades-spanning tale of a Holocaust survivor architect’s bruising encounter with the American dream. Still, that three-and-a-half hour run time seems to have been presented as Exhibit A in the case against Brady Corbet’s film; that it’s too grand, too ambitious, too full of itself. It’s got a bloody interval, for Christ’s sake! Who does this Corbet fella think he is?</p><p>Which seems strange, because a lot of what the film has been criticised for is usually seen as an asset.

This adaptation is suitably grand and sprawling – an explosion of summertime colour and a fine advertisement for rural Sicily. It tells the story of Don Fabrizio Corbera, a landed prince attempting to hold back the tides of change as Garibaldi’s revolutionary army threatens what he considers his family’s ancestral birthright. Netflix has its cake and eats it, paying lip service to history while leaning heavily into the plentiful sex, sun and scenery, delivering the goods as a lush, stylish costume drama. <em><br>

<p>Sheriffs search home in New Mexico after bodies discovered but say no sign of struggle, foul play or evidence of gas leak</p><p>Investigators in Santa Fe, New Mexico, are continuing to search for answers after Gene Hackman, an Oscar winner who graced the silver screen for more than 60 years, and his wife, the classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, were found dead at their home under suspicious circumstances.</p><p>A maintenance worker found the couple’s bodies at their home on Wednesday, along with one of their three dogs, who was also found dead. The front door was open, although the Santa Fe county sheriff’s office has said there were no signs of foul play, and no obvious evidence of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning. But the scene was strange enough that the sheriff’s office sought a search warrant on Wednesday evening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/gene-hackman-wife-death-investigation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>British politicians think they exercise a moderating force on strongmen. In practice, ‘diplomacy’ and ‘pragmatism’ only ease their path</p><p>Why is Westminster, supposedly one of the world’s great centres of democratic moderation, so welcoming to far-right foreign governments? For more than a century, since the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini, authoritarians have often found allies, apologists or a deliberate absence of criticism in the Commons, despite our parliament’s self-image as a historic enemy of fascism.</p><p>One reason for this forgiving attitude is that foreign policy is a pragmatic business, and Britain has increasingly become a country that can’t afford to make enemies. The Starmer government’s determination to see no evil in the Trump administration can be partly explained in those terms.</p><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/britain-politics-authoritarian-leaders-trump-mussolini">Continue read

<p>With more spending going to defence, the latest budget cut will take Britain’s aid contribution to its lowest for a quarter of a century</p><p>Keir Starmer’s decision this week to slash Britain’s overseas aid budget and divert to defence spending will take UK aid to developing countries to its lowest level in a generation.
