The Amazon boss has never been an overtly\npolitical man, except to the extent that he supports whatever\nhelps him stay rich and take over the world with his robotic form\nof ultra-capitalism. But he is not inclined to spend his time on\nthe phone haranguing Post editors about coverage decisions. When\nyou are worth close to $200 billion, your time is too valuable\nfor that.</p>\n\n<p>There is no guarantee, however, that that will always be\ntrue.
