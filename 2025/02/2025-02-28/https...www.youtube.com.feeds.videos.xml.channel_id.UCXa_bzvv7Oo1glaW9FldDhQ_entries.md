Monster Hunter Wilds isn't the first game in the franchise to run on the RE Engine. However, compared to Monster Hunter Rise, it operates on a completely different scale with complex ecosystems, higher fidelity, dynamic weather systems, and seamless travel between environments.

Considering open-world-like games are the Achilles' heel of RE Engine, it's interesting to see how Wilds performs on PC and PS5. Even without meeting the requirements for 4K/60 FPS at Ultra settings, it still delivers a respectable frame rate with everything maxed out. Furthermore, the fidelity and art direction of the title truly shine.

It's a different story altogether on PS5. Despite improvements over the beta in terms of frame rate, Performance Mode still struggles with image quality and aliasing, on top of excessive pop-in and asset loading. Resolution and Balanced Mode fare better, though they suffer from many of the same issues.

There's a lot to like about Monster Hunter Wilds, which is out today for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. While reviews somewhat agree on the difficulty being on the easy side and technical issues on consoles, the action RPG delivers where it counts, namely the combat.

It's no small feat, especially considering previous titles in the franchise were exceptional in that regard, especially World and Rise. However, Monster Hunter Wilds goes above and beyond with its responsiveness, delivering a visceral experience that's also easy to get into. Each weapon offers the same nuance you've come to expect, but with the wounds and Focus Mode adding more dimension.

The monster line-up also doesn't disappoint in terms of how it tests your knowledge of each weapon. Check out what makes Monster Hunter Wilds' combat the very best in the series.

The Pokemon Company, Nintendo, and Game Freak have finally shown us more of Pokemon Legends: Z-A, the follow up to 2022’s surprisingly compelling reinvention of the Pokemon formula. 

While the title had been announced last year, we hadn’t seen any of it until now, so speculation about the exact nature and structure it would take has been running rampant. Now, however, we’ve finally got our first look at the game as part of the recent Pokemon Presents presentation, which provided us some concrete details – and there’s a fair bit to chew on here, from the single city present day setting to a brand new battle system. 

All of this suggests that the spirit of experimentation that marked the first Legends game will stay alive in this game as well. Here is a look at ten new things we learned about it.
