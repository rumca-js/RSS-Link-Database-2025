I’d say over 90% are just spam, but there are definitely some legit ones mixed in there too. This is up from about 1700/mo. last year.</p> <p>Right now we&#39;re using Proofpoint so we started looking at the CLEAR add-on. We&#39;re also looking at Abnormal, Sublime, and Material who all have some URP related features. To me, they all look decent on paper, but reviews online are mixed. Seems like they help cut down a good amount of manual work but are known to have issues with accuracy. This got me thinking... why aren’t there more managed services for this? I’ve found a few, just not as many as I expected. Feels like an easy layup for some of these MSSPs/MDRs.</p> <p>Am I missing something here? </p> <p>Maybe we shouldn&#39;t care as much about looking at every reported email, or the accuracy of having a tool do i

But if there isn&#39;t a significant amount of cloud or highly distributed resources, why pay the extra money to offload the work to a SSE that your firewall is already doing and is better positioned for all of your east west traffic?
