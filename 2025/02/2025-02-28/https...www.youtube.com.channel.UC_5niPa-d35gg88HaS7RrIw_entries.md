HE IS A MANDRILL‼️‼️‼️ Be the first to watch #Mufasa: The Lion King at home today. 

Exploring the unlikely rise of the beloved king of the Pride Lands, “Mufasa: The Lion King” enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny—their bonds will be tested as they work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe.

In ONE MONTH, get ready for a road trip to remember.
Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Road Trip is available March 28, only on @disneyplus. 

Alexander Garcia (Thom Nemer) has always believed he has the worst luck in the world, so when his mom Val (Eva Longoria) devises a plan to bring her seemingly disconnected family on a fancy vacation to Mexico City aboard a luxury RV as part of her travel writing job, he is sure it will end in disaster. Despite his fears, the family – including dad Frank (Jesse Garcia), teen sister Mia (Paulina Chávez), Grandma Lidia (Rose Portillo), and Grandpa Gil (Cheech Marin) – set out, only to find absolutely everything is going chaotically, hilariously wrong. When the family discovers an ancient, cursed idol may be to blame, they must work together to return it to where it belongs.
