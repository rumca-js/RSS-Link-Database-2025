The key insight is that LLMs can build better responses incrementally while using fewer tokens overall.</p> <p>Key technical points: - Uses a three-stage drafting process: initial sketch, refinement, and final polish - Each stage builds on previous drafts while maintaining core reasoning - Implements specific prompting strategies to guide the drafting process - Tested against standard prompting and chain-of-thought methods</p> <p>Results from their experiments: - 40% reduction in total tokens used compared to baseline methods - Maintained or improved accuracy across multiple reasoning tasks - Particularly effective on math and logic problems - Showed consistent performance across different LLM architectures</p> <p>I think this approach c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’ve never really enjoyed analyzing my chess games, but I know it&#39;s a crucial part in getting better. I feel like the reason I hate analysis is because I often don’t actually understand the best move, despite the engine insisting it’s correct. Most engines just show &quot;Best Move&quot;, highlight an eval bar, and move on. But they don’t explain what went wrong or why I made a mistake in the first place.</p> <p>That’s what got me thinking: What if game review felt as easy as chatting with a coach? So I&#39;ve been building an LLM-powered chess analysis tool that:</p> <ul> <li>Finds the turning points in your game automatically.</li> <li>Explains WHY a move was bad, instead of just showing the best one.</li> <li>Lets you chat with an AI to ask questions about your mistakes.</li> </ul> <p>Honestly, seeing my critical mistakes explained in plain English (not just eval bars) made game analysis way more fun—and actually useful.</
