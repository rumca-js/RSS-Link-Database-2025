Over thousands of years, wolves with more tolerant temperaments may have had better access to resources and selectively bred with similar mates. This natural selection process might have led to the domesticated dogs we know today. While not definitive, the study provides insights into how early human-animal relationships evolved and how domestication may have occurred without direct human intervention.",
