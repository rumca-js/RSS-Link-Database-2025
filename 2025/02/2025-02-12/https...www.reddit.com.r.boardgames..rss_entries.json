There is a question, with 4 possible answers, but as a bonus on all of cards is something called team line where you have to sing a set of lyrics. It&#39;s a small after thought in the game itself but I think it&#39;s the most fun part. Is anyone aware of a music trivia game out there that is made solely of these types of questions where you need to sing actual song lyrics? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Twilightcampfighter1\"> /u/Twilightcampfighter1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1io0hw4/music_trivia_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1io0hw4/music_trivia_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My board game group is a huge fan of games like it and the hidden movement aspect of it looks interesting.</p> <p>However, the game has limited availability, and the Gamefound backing period already ended so I wanted to ask if y&#39;all had games that would scratch that itch. I heard they&#39;re making a Season 2 for it but it&#39;ll be a long time before that releases.</p> <p>A similar game our group has tried before is Betrayal at House on the Hill but we&#39;ve played it so many times already and are bored of it (the rules are also questionable at times). I&#39;ve heard some people highly recommend The Beast but I heard the game isn&#39;t as fun when there are more than 3 players. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IamaNinja21\"> /u/IamaNinja21 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ww",
