<p>A US judge has ruled in favor of Thomson Reuters in a AI training fight against Ross Intelligence, a legal AI startup, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610721/thomson-reuters-ross-intelligence-ai-copyright-infringement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Verge</a>. Thomson Reuters sued Ross Intelligence in 2020 for using the company’s legal research platform Westlaw to train Ross Intelligence’s AI without permission. Westlaw indexes large amounts of non-copyrighted material, but mixes it with its own content.</p>



<p>Ross Intelligence argued that the training should be classified under “fair use” practices, but the judge disagreed. Instead, the court held that Ro

<p>It’s already known that today’s generative AI (genAI) tools often have <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619076/bings-ai-chatbot-came-to-work-for-me-i-had-to-fire-it.html">trouble with basic facts</a>. Now, it’s clear they don’t well with current events either.</p>



<p>That’s the upshot of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/bbc-research-into-ai-assistants.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/documents/bbc-research-into-ai-assistants.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> test by the BBC</a>, which asked ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Perplexity to answer 100 questions using BBC articles as a source; more than half of the ans

<p>Reflecting the erosion of universality, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3511199/everything-we-know-about-apple-intelligence.html">Apple Intelligence</a> will now be coming to China, but rather than working with a US AI partner, the company will use Chinese-made AI tech from Alibaba.</p>



<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-partners-with-alibaba-to-develop-ai-features-for-iphone-users-in-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a></em>, Apple and Alibaba have already “submitted the co-developed features for approval to regulators.” The claim hasn’t yet been confirmed. If true, it would mean Alibaba’s Qwen model will

<p>The release of the latest version of the Chinese genAI bot DeepSeek last month <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3808579/chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-unveils-open-source-model-to-rival-openai-o1.html">upended the tech world</a> when its creators claimed it was built for only $6 million — far less than the hundreds of billions of dollars Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Meta, and others have poured into genAI development. </p>



<p>The shockwaves were immediate. GenAI-related stocks took a nosedive, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3810766/deepseek-triggers-shock-waves-for-ai-giants-but-the-disruption-wont-last.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/ar

<p>Windows 10 has less than a year left before it hits its end of support deadline. Starting in October 2025, you’ll have to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2507297/microsoft-adds-extended-consumer-support-for-windows-10-diehards.html" target="_blank">pay for security updates</a> if you want to keep using Microsoft’s nearly-nine-year-old operating system. That means now is the time to think about upgrading any Windows 10 PCs you’re still working with to the current Windows 11 OS.</p>



<p>If you believe the viral headlines, things are getting messy: Microsoft, the rumors say, is actually trying to <em>stop </em>people from grabbing free upgrades to Windows 11, and the company is even eli

<p>Look, if you’ve read this column for long now, you know I’m extremely guarded with my enthusiasm for Gemini and the other similar large-language-model AI answer-bots.</p>



<p>Plain and simple, they just <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2117752/google-gemini-ai.html#:~:text=The%20Gemini%20reliability%20problem"><em>aren’t</em> reliable as on-demand answer genies</a> — despite being positioned as exactly that — and they’ve got a nasty habit of coughing up inaccurate info with an astonishing amount of confidence.</p>



<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3806751/google-amazon-ai.html">said it before</a>, and I’ll say it again: If something is inaccurate or unrel

<p>Global enterprise technology spending is set to grow by 5.6% in 2025, reaching $4.9 trillion, as enterprises continue to prioritize investments in cybersecurity, cloud computing, generative AI, and digital transformation.</p>



<p>North America and the Asia-Pacific region are projected to be the fastest-growing markets, while software and IT services are projected to account for 70% of all global technology spending by 2029, according to a Forrester report.</p>

<p>It’s become increasing clear that <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3810687/cios-grapple-with-subpar-global-genai-models.html">quality plunges when moving from English to non-English-based large language models</a> (LLMs). They’re less accurate and there’s a serious lack of transparency around data training, both in terms of data volume and data quality.</p>



<p>The latter has long been a problem for generative AI (genAI) tools and platforms.</p>



<p>But enterprises aren’t paying less for less-productive models, even though the value they offer is diminished. So, why aren’t CIOs getting a price break for non-English models? Because without any data transparency, they rarely kno
