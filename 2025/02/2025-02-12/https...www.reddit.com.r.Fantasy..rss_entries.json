I fully intend to keep making my way through his past works but I&#39;d love to discover other authors to add to my wishlist.</p> <p>The main things I love about his writing are:</p> <ul> <li>His humor feels effortless and witty. </li> <li>Plots seem to move along quickly.

More about the contest and links at the bottom.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Oathsworn Legacy</strong> is a chonker of a book but its style of telling is what makes it feel very digestible in a one bite at a time kind of way. At the risk of repeating every reviewer out there- it\u2019s a collection of shorter tales that make up the whole picture. Very much like a season of television - Supernatural comes to mind here, because of the monster of the week feel in the shorter stories with an overreaching arc across them. I chose The Oathsworn Legacy to read over the holidays for that very reason. I thought it would be easier to keep up with self-contained stories like this while busy, and my plan worked well.</p> <p><strong>The Oathsworn Legacy</strong> had some cool ideas, I liked how the small-scale small-stakes stories turn rather large by the end of things. Also, I particularly liked the whole old-school feel ",

As someone who was born in China, my problem with it so far is that it reads like a badly researched fanfic based on the real Chinese history.

Like Keju is a real test in China, but it does not test 27 books; in fact, it only tests you on five books, and the books themselves are not hard to understand, but it\u2019s the way they quiz you that is tricky. So, why are you calling it Keju??? Just call it something else\u2026 </p> <p>And, they mention historical figures like Mengzi, who was a real Chinese philosopher, but he would NOT be in Keju because his philosophy is that you should live freely\u2026 like a hippie\u2026 the opposite of what a government entrance exam would want.",

From the beginning they were my favorite characters. The Watchers were an extremely interesting concept and I enjoyed their interactions. By the end of Fevered Star I thought Naranpa was leaving to figure out how to outsmart the gods her and Serapio avatar. </p> <p>Instead, she and Iktan go on to contribute almost nothing to the story. I thought Balam was gonna have Serapio on the ropes before Naranpa dragged him to the dream realm, but instead she just gets manipulated and then dies(?). </p> <p>I was super disappointed because everyone said this story was wrapped in a bow, but that\u2019s only true for Serapio and Xiala (and I guess Okoa). The two ex-Watchers contribute so little to this story, I wonder why even have these two in book 1. I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019d rather these two have died if this was their endings. </p> <p>Anyone else feel like this? Did anyone e",

For example, my favorite series of all time is The Amber Chronicles, which partly takes place on Earth, and in which the protagonist frequently travels to and from Earth. </p> <p>There\u2019s just something about a \u201cmore-than-human\u201d character who is from a different world traveling to Earth, or sharing his \u201csecret\u201d about his powers or another world to a regular person. Another half-decent example is City of Bones, but that\u2019s very YA, and barely fantasy. The Pendragon series is another I loved growing up. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know if that makes sense at all, or if anyone feels the same way, but are there any other books or series out there that do a similar thing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Purple-Evidence3084\"> /u/Purple-Evidence3084 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1inhz3t/any_fantasy_booksseries_",
