China’s $93 billion smart city of Xiongan is President Xi Jinping’s utopian legacy. But after seven years of development, one of the world’s most expensive infrastructure projects remains largely empty. Located 60 miles outside Beijing, Xiongan is designed to ease pressure on the overcrowded and congested Chinese capital of more than 20 million people.

WSJ examines the challenges facing the megaproject and how it is exposing the limits to President Xi’s rule.
