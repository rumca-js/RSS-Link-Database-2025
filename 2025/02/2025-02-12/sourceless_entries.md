This paper introduces a new data-structural object that we call the tiny pointer. In many applications, traditional $\log n $-bit pointers can be replaced with $o (\log n )$-bit tiny pointers at the cost of only a constant-factor time overhead. We develop a comprehensive theory of tiny pointers, and give optimal constructions for both fixed-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which all of the tiny pointers must be the same size) and variable-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which the average tiny-pointer size must be small, but some tiny pointers can be larger). If a tiny pointer references an element in an array filled to load factor $1 - 1 / k$, then the optimal tiny-pointer size is $Θ(\log \log \log n + \log k) $ bits in the fixed-size case, and $ Θ(\log k) $ expected bits in the variable-size case. Our tiny-pointer constructions also require us to revisit several classic problems having to do with balls and bins; these results may be of independent interest.

Growing interest has been seen in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and therapy. However, no modern studies have evaluated subjective and autonomic effects of different and pharmaceutically well-defined doses of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 16 healthy subjects (eight women, eight men) who underwent six 25 h sessions and received placebo, LSD (25, 50, 100, and 200 µg), and 200 µg LSD 1 h after administration of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg). Test days were separated by at least 10 days. Outcome measures included self-rating scales that evaluated subjective effects, autonomic effects, adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 24 h. The pharmacokinetic-subjective response relationship was evaluated. LSD showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination and dose-dependently induced su

## Models show intensifying wildfires in a warming world due to changes in vegetation and humidity; only a minor role for lightning
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250212151152.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250212151152.htm)

Climate scientists present a realistic supercomputer simulation that resolves the complex interactions between fire, vegetation, smoke and the atmosphere. The authors find that increasing greenhouse gas emissions will likely increase the global lightning frequency by about 1.6% per degree Celsius global warming, with regional hotspots in the eastern United States, Kenya, Uganda and Argentina. Locally this could intensify wildfire occurrences. However, the dominant drivers for the growing area burned by fires each year remain shifts in global humidity and a more rapid growth of vegetation, which can serve as wildfire fuel.
