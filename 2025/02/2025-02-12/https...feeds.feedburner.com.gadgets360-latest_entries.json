        "description": "A total of 259 rocket launches took place in 2024, continuing a four-year trend of increasing spaceflight activity. SpaceX led the surge with 132 Falcon 9 launches, contributing to satellite deployments for Starlink and military purposes. Other nations, including Russia and China, also expanded their launch operations. In 2025, new rockets from Blue Origin, Sierra Space, and Rocket Lab will enter service, alongside regulatory changes to ease commercial spaceflight. European and Australian companies are advancing independent launch capabilities, reflecting a growing focus on sovereign space access.",

        "description": "A significant solar storm in May 2024 led to the creation of two temporary radiation belts, detected by the CIRBE satellite in June. One belt contained high-energy electrons, while the other was rich in protons, a rare occurrence. While the electron belt dissipated in three months, the proton-dominated belt remains, potentially affecting space missions. This discovery highlights the long-term effects of solar activity on Earth's magnetosphere, with implications for satellite operations and astronaut safety. Scientists continue to monitor space weather to understand its impact on technology and human exploration.",

Researchers found coins, jewellery and relics possibly used in religious offerings. Geochemical analysis indicates animal sacrifices, while architectural findings suggest ritual structures.

Christian missionaries condemned such practices, calling the offerings \"devil\u2019s money.\" This site remains one of the best-preserved examples of pagan worship in the region.",
