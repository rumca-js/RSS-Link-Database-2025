In many cases, smart locks dispense with physical keys altogether in favor of PINs, fingerprints, NFC tags, smartphone apps\u2013even your smartphone or smart watch. And with some of the latest models, you can even unlock your door with just your face! Smart locks deliver lots of other benefits, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They invariably have logging systems, so you can keep track of who\u2019s coming and going\u2013and when. That\u2019s incredibly useful whether you have a teenager who tends to break curfew or merely want to give temporary access to houseguests, service providers, or Airbnb guests. Smart locks are an incredible upgrade over the old way of doing things, and these are our top picks in several categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-headi",

(It comes with a two-year warranty from Allstate.) Other highlights include a 512GB SSD, a 15.6-inch screen with a zippy 144Hz refresh rate, and a backlit keyboard. Those specs should be more than enough to play the latest games, though graphically intense titles (like the recent <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>) might need some lower graphics settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll ",
