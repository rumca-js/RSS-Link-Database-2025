        "description": "Hazelight Studios\u2019 next game, after their accolade hoarding game of the year It Takes Two, is coming March 6th to PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and like its predecessor this is a strictly co-operative experience, either on the couch or online. \n\nSuch is the flashiness of Hazelight Studios\u2019 presentation, Split Fiction looks like another high-quality experience underpinned by variety, imagination, fun, and emotional storytelling. \n\nThe gimmick here is that both playable characters operate within two disparate worlds of written fiction; they are novelists in sci-fi and fantasy, and as the game takes place in simulations of their written works, players of Split Fiction can expect to experience numerous worlds which jump between the two genres. Will this be another game of the year contender for the Swedish studio? We think so.",
