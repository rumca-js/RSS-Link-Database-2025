<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>MacLean was my favorite author in my teens in the 70s and 80s. Since then his books have followed me through several moves but have been rarely read, except maybe H.M.S. Ulysses. </p> <p>Lately I’ve started to re-read them again and I can see the reason I, and quite a large number of other readers, liked them all those decades ago. The stories are quite outdated, writing is rather naive and the characters, specially in later books, thinner than paper they are printed on. Still, the actual stories are interesting for quick read and some of them manage to get under my skin to create an emotional response.</p> <p>Considering that he was one of the biggest sellers in several countries for years, it is interesting that his works are rarely mentioned anymore. Thus my question - are his works still known today or were they solely a product of their time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Veetupeetu"> /u/V

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>She did it again.</strong> Another book. Another list of painfully real, beautifully flawed, and <em>desperately</em> in need of therapy characters.</p> <p>Halfway through <em>Intermezzo</em>, I was already buzzing—<em>how is she going to end this?</em> How will it all tie together? The anticipation was real, and let me tell you—the ending did <em>not</em> disappoint.</p> <p>One thing that stood out was how distinct each character’s voice felt. Maybe it’s just me, but when Ivan or Naomi spoke, their dialogues had this raw simplicity—like you could <em>feel</em> their naivety in the way they were written. Meanwhile, Margaret and Peter? Layers on layers. Every conversation felt like a chess game played by two emotionally exhausted grandmasters. Messy, brilliant, and just <em>so</em> Rooney.</p> <p>Now, my <em>one</em> complaint (which is really just my own wishful thinking): I wanted a more <em>satisfying</em> resolution for Peter, Sylvia, and
