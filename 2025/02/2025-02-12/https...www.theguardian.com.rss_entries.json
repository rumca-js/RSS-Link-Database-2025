A painter is murdered with a hammer blow to the head and a chisel to the heart. It looks as though someone has painted over a section of the frescoes he has been labouring on for years at the church of San Lorenzo. But who could have killed old Jacopo da Pontormo, and why?</p><p>So begins this historical epistolary detective novel, stuffed with real-life Renaissance artists behaving badly. Investigating the murder at the behest of the duke, Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, is Giorgio Vasari, painter and author of The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.
