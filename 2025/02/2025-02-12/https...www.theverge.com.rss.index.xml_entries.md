<p class="has-text-align-none">Crytek is laying off around 15 percent of its 400 employees, affecting development teams and shared services. The announcement comes months after Crytek put the development of its next <em>Crysis </em>game “on hold” in Q3, 2024.</p>

The Galaxy A56 is rumored to launch in March, right around the same time as rival devices from Apple and Google.</p>
