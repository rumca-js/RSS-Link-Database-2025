<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just recently got into Linux because I wanted try something different and being an owner of an AMD GPU(and CPU) I was told it would run my application better than Windows 11 would. So far I&#39;ve noticed a big improvement in productivity applications and even PC games. I&#39;ve never tried a Nvidia GPU on Linux so that&#39;s why I posed this question.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Awkward-Iron-921"> /u/Awkward-Iron-921 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1io0jsz/what_do_you_feel_works_better_with_linux_amd_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1io0jsz/what_do_you_feel_works_better_with_linux_amd_or/">[comments]</a></span>

I just do work stuff on it though and never have a chance to actually play around with it.</p> <p>It&#39;s a fairly good one lol (Ryzen 7 7800x3d, 64gb ram, nvidia 4070, 2 x4tb ssd) so it should be capable of running anything I throw at it. I stuck Mint on there but just wondering if there&#39;s any other distros I should try instead. </p> <p>I don&#39;t have anything in particular I need to do with it just looking to futz around with it but who knows? If MS keeps adding garbage to Windows maybe I&#39;ll start using it more.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GregP74"> /u/GregP74 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1io015w/what_distro_for_higher_end_pc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1io015w/what_distro_for_higher_end_pc/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There ares some niche in software really important. Maybe they seem nerdy fields but full industries depends on well standarized auxiliary software that can&#39;t be enjoy in Linux just for the skin of the teeth. One of them is music production. Linux has amazing available DAWs as Ardour or Reaper. nd Ubuntu Studio... wow. That shit is really incredible with his insane low-latency rate even in very old computers.</p> <p>But DAWs need FX and most of the best are privative in VST3 format (I know Steinberg privative as well). Calf plugins, for example are far away from, for example, pro-Q3 o TDR.</p> <p>I know that one can use Carla and other bridges, but this implies inconvenience for the non-expert user. All the DAWs are very similar in their performance, and current desktop version of Linux distros are wonderful. Last Linux Mint, for example, has reach an incredibly user-friendly and robust level. </p> <p>But almost studios, producers and musicians u

Will send image of what&#39;s on my screen rn, but essentially what happened was I was downloading some stuff to get PS2 emulator running( I think it was called &quot;flex&quot; or something, don&#39;t remember it was just on some video and I got it through the terminal). After a couple hours, my computer kept on inputting left and backspace(but only in certain circumstances, like it wouldn&#39;t for videos), even after I unplugged my keyboard and all other input. Then, I decided to restart my PC, logged in and got the image attached.

## How do you, or do you vet if a software will paywall features or "enshittify"?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obviously we all want to avoid enshittified (aggressively monetized) software or at least get our money&#39;s worth. I&#39;m looking at self-hosting software right now and one I&#39;m looking has a pricing page but only for cloud (no other paywalled features) and is open source. I tried looking up future plans and didn&#39;t find much, so it doesn&#39;t seem like it will enshittify. (not related) I had thought about switching to Omnivore for a long time but then they merged with ElevenLabs and the rest is history.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTwelveYearOld"> /u/TheTwelveYearOld </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ingrld/how_do_you_or_do_you_vet_if_a_software_will/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ingrld/how_do_you_or_do_you_vet_if_a_software_will/">[comments]</a></span>
