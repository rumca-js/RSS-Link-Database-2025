<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So first I downloaded fitgirl repack, which ran great and all but didnt have online support, and was the steam release while the fix from online-fix is the Microsoft Store release. So I redownloaded the game from online-fix and now the online works, but the game runs horrible even the menus are in slow motion.
