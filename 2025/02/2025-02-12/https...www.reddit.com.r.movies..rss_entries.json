Haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it since, the main thing for me was just the atmosphere of it all. The setting of them being in Antarctica with nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, is practically perfect for a horror movie. Arguably the best character (and in general) writing I\u2019ve seen from a horror movie, they did everything right that they could, they were a group of scientists and they all acted like it. All came up with perfect plans to survive and figure out the monster. The movie didn\u2019t have to rely on dumb characters to move the plot forward, they instead gave us incredibly smart characters that ended up having no choice but to fail in the end. Plus that ending, so masterfully done, cliffhangers suck until it\u2019s something like that. Keeps you thinking about the movie long, long after you\u2019re done watching it. Absolute 10/10 in my book.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

It was basically envisioned as this: one Hobbit film, then two Lord of the Rings films under Miramax but UA actually owned the film rights to The Hobbit so they basically just decided to do two Lord of the Rings films and do The Hobbit down the road as a prequel.</p> <p>Well, Peter Jackson tried to talk Miramax into doing three films but there were intent on only doing two Lord of the Rings films, the first film covering Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers and the second film covering Return of the King. And Jackson agreed to it for a while. Then somehow during pre-production, Disney CEO Michael Eisner looked at the budget which was $75M a piece for these two films. So basically, after that: Miramax wanted to tell the whole story all in one film. Here&#39;s what changes that Ja",
