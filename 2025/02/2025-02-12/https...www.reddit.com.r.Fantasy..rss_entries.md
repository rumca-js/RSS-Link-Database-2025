More about the contest and links at the bottom.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Oathsworn Legacy</strong> is a chonker of a book but its style of telling is what makes it feel very digestible in a one bite at a time kind of way. At the risk of repeating every reviewer out there- it’s a collection of shorter tales that make up the whole picture. Very much like a season of television - Supernatural comes to mind here, because of the monster of the week feel in the shorter stories with an overreaching arc across them. I chose The Oathsworn Legacy to read over the holidays for that very reason. I thought it would be easier to keep up with self-contained stories like this while busy, and my plan worked well.</p> <p><strong>The Oathsworn Legacy</strong> had some cool ideas, I liked how the small-scale small-stakes stories turn rather large by the end of things. Also, I particularly liked the whole old-school feel

Overall this makes the story much more intriguing for me, as the author is pouring something very personal in the story.</p> <p>I also really enjoyed The Forever War by Joe haldeman (SF) which was inspired by the authors personal processing of the Vietnam war. </p> <p>I slowly come to realise that this kind of personal touch makes a book/story stand out for me.</p> <p>Do you know of more authors and storys who are heavily influenced by personal experience and if yes in which kind?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am still only in the beginning, but this bothers me so much. As someone who was born in China, my problem with it so far is that it reads like a badly researched fanfic based on the real Chinese history. I would had been fine if they just created a totally different world with some elements inspired by the Chinese culture like Jasmine throne, but no, it’s a weird mix of things that is loosely real, but mostly weird and makes no sense. Like Keju is a real test in China, but it does not test 27 books; in fact, it only tests you on five books, and the books themselves are not hard to understand, but it’s the way they quiz you that is tricky. So, why are you calling it Keju??? Just call it something else… </p> <p>And, they mention historical figures like Mengzi, who was a real Chinese philosopher, but he would NOT be in Keju because his philosophy is that you should live freely… like a hippie… the opposite of what a government entrance exam would want.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically the title.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always kind of been a reader but over the last year or so I&#39;ve been getting way more into it and reading a bunch, especially fantasy. I&#39;m at the point now where I&#39;ve read most of the popular/mainstream stuff (Sanderson, Rothfuss, Jordan, Feist etc) and now I need recs for slightly less well-known books. </p> <p>There&#39;s often posts on here asking for the &#39;most obscure fantasy recommendations&#39; and I&#39;ve written down and even ordered some of these, but really I&#39;m looking for the more mid-level stuff, not super obscure but not super well-known either. Also, if possible, the longer the better.</p> <p>Hope this makes sense</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SPX2013"> /u/SPX2013 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1inkf2r/mediumobscurity_recs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finished the Between Earth and Sky trilogy and I’m disappointed by Naranpa and Iktan’s ending. From the beginning they were my favorite characters. The Watchers were an extremely interesting concept and I enjoyed their interactions. By the end of Fevered Star I thought Naranpa was leaving to figure out how to outsmart the gods her and Serapio avatar. </p> <p>Instead, she and Iktan go on to contribute almost nothing to the story. I thought Balam was gonna have Serapio on the ropes before Naranpa dragged him to the dream realm, but instead she just gets manipulated and then dies(?). </p> <p>I was super disappointed because everyone said this story was wrapped in a bow, but that’s only true for Serapio and Xiala (and I guess Okoa). The two ex-Watchers contribute so little to this story, I wonder why even have these two in book 1. I’m not kidding, I’d rather these two have died if this was their endings. </p> <p>Anyone else feel like this? Did anyone e

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I LOVE when fantasy books take place partly in or crossover to Earth. For example, my favorite series of all time is The Amber Chronicles, which partly takes place on Earth, and in which the protagonist frequently travels to and from Earth. </p> <p>There’s just something about a “more-than-human” character who is from a different world traveling to Earth, or sharing his “secret” about his powers or another world to a regular person. Another half-decent example is City of Bones, but that’s very YA, and barely fantasy. The Pendragon series is another I loved growing up. </p> <p>I don’t know if that makes sense at all, or if anyone feels the same way, but are there any other books or series out there that do a similar thing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Purple-Evidence3084"> /u/Purple-Evidence3084 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1inhz3t/any_fantasy_booksseries_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I was curious if anyone knew of any fantasy novels where the antagonists were using irregular warfare tactics (terrorist attacks, sabotage, etc). I feel like usually in fantasy novels it’s the reverse more often—little guy using hit and run tactics to stand up to the evil king/overlord, and was curious if anyone had seen the reverse.

I don’t know how I am going to follow it. I just checked out <strong>The Will of the Many</strong> and I am hoping that one is different enough to not pale in comparison.
