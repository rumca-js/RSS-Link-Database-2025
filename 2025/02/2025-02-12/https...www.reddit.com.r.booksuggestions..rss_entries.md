The only other piece of media I&#39;ve encountered that also had me encounter this emotion was &quot;Everything Everywhere All At Once.&quot; It&#39;s a hard feeling to describe, but I think the best description I&#39;ve been able to distill is &quot;sublime&quot;:</p> <p>&quot;Of a feature of nature or art: that fills the mind with a sense of overwhelming grandeur or irresistible power; that inspires awe, great reverence, or other high emotion, by reason of its beauty, vastness, or grandeur.&quot;</p> <p>I&#39;ve been trying to scratch an itch for a book to read that has these kinds of qualities and evokes these kinds of feelings.

If anyone thinks there are books with similar characters however not a ghost storyline I wouldn’t mind either. Also I dislike a lot of spice and would rather it be a bit more about friendship/ romance slow burn. </p> <p>Just wanting something I can read that reminds me of the show, sorry if i didn’t explain it right, it’s easier if you have watched the show xxx. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zealotofalchemie"> /u/zealotofalchemie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1inmcqw/books_like_julie_and_the_phantoms/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksugge
