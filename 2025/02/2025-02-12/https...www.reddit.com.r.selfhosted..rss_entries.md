It ships with a slick WebUI, but that&#39;s not all, it features an OpenAPI Swagger RestClient and follows the RESTful design best practices, so you can easily automate link generation from your commandline with curl one-liners. And we&#39;re not even finished yet. If you are a true OG self-hoster, you want to monitor your applications - chances are you that with Grafana (and maybe prometheus as TimeseriesDB). Flink exposes a Prometheus /metrics endpoint, where you can nicely query how many links Flink has shorten, how often Links are visited (and/or QR Codes are scanned).</p> <p>Flink

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently started using <a href="https://github.com/henrygd/beszel">Beszel </a>to monitor a few hosts in my homelab. I was cynical about it at first because why would we need it if we have Grafana + Prometheus, but I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by how straightforward it is to set up and use.</p> <p>While Prometheus + Grafana combo offers a lot more, Beszel provides a simple, lightweight option that works great for getting a basic overview of your systems. And I feel their docs are more accessible to beginners.</p> <p>If you&#39;re new to monitoring or don&#39;t have any tools in place yet, I recommend giving Beszel a try.</p> <p>I also wrote a <a href="https://selfhost.esc.sh/simple-monitoring-with-beszel/">blog post</a> detailing my setup process, which you might find helpful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/m4nz"> /u/m4nz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>It&#39;s been like half of a year and like 10 unsuccessful attempts to establish xray - &gt; pi-hole - &gt; unbound DNS requests. While xray -&gt; unbound scheme works (with 127.0.0.1:53) - I can&#39;t integrate pi-hole here as Unbound refuses to leave 53 port alone. Config below.</p> <p>My VPS on Debian 12 is almost virgin - just xray, nginx unbound, pi-hole, lightphd, ufw, custom SSH port + SSH key, BBR, RTT and that&#39;s all - seems like nothing can force unbound to stick to 53.</p> <p>I also unsuccesfully tried looking for solutions with ChatGPT. Am I missing something?</p> <p>forward-zone:</p> <p>name: &quot;.&quot;</p> <p>forward-addr: <a href="http://1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a> # Cloudflare DNS</p> <p>forward-addr: <a href="http://8.8.8.8">8.8.8.8</a> # Google DNS</p> <p>forward-addr: <a href="http://8.8.4.4">8.8.4.4</a> # Google DNS</p> <p>server:</p> <p># interface</p> <p>interface: <a href="http://127.0.0.1">127.0.0.1</a></p> <p>tls-po
