The on-prem network is obviously segmented into different subnets, and we also have a POC with a micro-segmentation vendor for it to limit lateral movement.</p> <p>In the cloud, it seems like there are 2 frontiers - network and identity. Getting access to a role with access to a resource makes it accessible from pretty much anywhere (from an attackers endpoint for example).<br/> The vendor we are looking at only takes into account the network aspect.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering how do you approach network and identity lateral movement risks in the cloud?<br/> 1) Is network micro-segmenting in the cloud something worth looking into?<br/> 2) Do you enforce role policies so they can only be assumed from specific resources, using IAM Trust Relationships for example? (essentially &quot;identity microsegmentation&quot;)</p> <p>Thanks f",

In particular I don&#39;t know how to distinguish between info sec risks and other organisational risks OR I don&#39;t have enough confidence in my definition to argue against others opinion. Hoping to get some clarity.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always understood it from a GRC perspective that: - an information security risk is the potential impact to an organisation (operational, financial, reputational, legal) that may arise from a threat exploiting a vulnerability in the organisation&#39;s environment which compromises the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the organisation&#39;s information asset(s).</p> <p>Where CIA Triad is defined as - confidentiality = is when information is only accessible to authorised individuals<br/> - integrity = is when information is complete, accurate and trust",
