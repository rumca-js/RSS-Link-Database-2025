Since then his books have followed me through several moves but have been rarely read, except maybe H.M.S. Ulysses. </p> <p>Lately I\u2019ve started to re-read them again and I can see the reason I, and quite a large number of other readers, liked them all those decades ago. The stories are quite outdated, writing is rather naive and the characters, specially in later books, thinner than paper they are printed on. Still, the actual stories are interesting for quick read and some of them manage to get under my skin to create an emotional response.</p> <p>Considering that he was one of the biggest sellers in several countries for years, it is interesting that his works are rarely mentioned anymore. Thus my question - are his works still known today or were they solely a product of their time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Veetupeetu\"> /u/V",
