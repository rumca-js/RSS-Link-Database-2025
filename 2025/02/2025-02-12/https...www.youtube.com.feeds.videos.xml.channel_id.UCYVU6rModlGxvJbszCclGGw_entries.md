The politicians are claiming that Tiktok is a threat. Exactly what the threat is is not specifically stated so I will analyze in terms of a Doxxing threat, Cybersecurity Threat, Privacy Threat, Psyop Threat, Military Threat. We will also compare this to other social media apps so we understand exactly what we can construe as a danger. This is completely unbiased with  no political baggage applied. This analysis will be done using an understanding of data science.
