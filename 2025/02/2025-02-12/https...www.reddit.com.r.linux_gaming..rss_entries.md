I had never really been a <em>fan</em> of Windows, but since I do a lot of gaming I felt stuck there. After getting a Steam Deck a while back, I realized just how mature Proton had gotten and how much compatibility was there. So I decided to finally get away from Windows once and (hopefully) for all.</p> <p><strong>Build/Distro Choices</strong></p> <p>Since I was intentionally building a PC for Linux, I got an AMD GPU. I got an AMD CPU as well, but mostly just because they&#39;re currently the best option. I kept a close eye on stock listings for a while and wa

I last installed a Linux distro over a year ago, so I decided to make this post and just ask about the state of it.</p> <p>My use cases would thus be:</p> <ul> <li><p>Heavily modding games, especially via Nexusmods collections and the vortex mod manager or, in case of Skyrim, via wabbajack. I am also dependent on ultra widescreen mods and programs for games to correctly display a 3440x1440 resolution, like Flawless Widescreen.</p></li> <li><p>Using cheat engine tables to enable randomizers and other gimmicks in games.</p></li> </ul> <p>These are the only 2 cases that Linux couldn&#39;t solve last time I had it as a daily driver.</p> <p>How is the state of it in 2025? Any experiences similar to mine where you had to improvise? Are those cases already possible with Linux? Any feedback would
