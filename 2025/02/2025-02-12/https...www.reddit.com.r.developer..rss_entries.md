<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’m the founder of an innovative music label and community focused on empowering independent artists. Our vision is to build a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology, DAO principles, and AI to give the community a direct say in what music gets released—all while challenging traditional industry gatekeeping.</p> <p>Right now, I’m operating on a shoestring budget and need a technical partner who’s experienced in:</p> <p>• <strong>Blockchain &amp; DAO frameworks:</strong> (focusing on decentralization, not specific cryptocurrencies or investment strategies)</p> <p>• <strong>App Development:</strong> Building robust, user-friendly applications.</p> <p>• <strong>AI Integration:</strong> Creating smart, responsive systems that enhance community engagement.</p> <p>I’m looking for someone excited to collaborate on this project initially on a partnership or equity basis, with the promise of future paid work as we grow.
