<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I have a very specific request. I&#39;m looking for retro games (2008-ish and earlier) that involve home customization/interior design but don&#39;t necessarily focus on it. Some examples I&#39;m thinking of are the early Animal Crossing series, and Sims 2 DS (i love that this one is plot-based but has an interior design element). I&#39;m open to any platform! Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/moodypup313"> /u/moodypup313 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1io12t4/retro_games_that_involve_interior_designhome/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1io12t4/retro_games_that_involve_interior_designhome/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back in the day, arcades were all the craze here in Bulgaria just like anywhere else. The difference is obviously not every place had the money to purchase original machines and we had a lot of bootleg ones. There was one that I still remember after 25+ years - it was Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, the difference is that underneath the coinslot you could see a Sega Genesis with the cartridge. Yet the came still worked with tokens somehow, if my memory serves me correct. The button layout was also arcade style, joysticks and all that. The display was a normal tilted arcade one, not a TV plugged inside. So anyone has an idea how they managed to do that and where can I find more information? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dwartbg9"> /u/dwartbg9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1inr8g4/im_still_trying_to_find_photo_or_figure_out_how_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa

The basic gameplay is extremely simple but finding your way to each house, figuring out what each item does, and dealing with horrible weapon optimization makes it quite hard.

But dying late game and having to slowly walk aaallll the way back the same exact route just to get back where you were is not fun. It will test your patience and willingness to persist.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is somewhat of a sad gaming story, but I wanted to share it and maybe you can share your own similar stories.</p> <p>Circa 1994, I would have been around 14 years old and my brother 13. I also had another brother who often gamed with us though he was a bit younger at around 10 years old at the time. This story is about the brother who was 1 year younger than me.</p> <p>We played Mortal Kombat II on the SNES a lot. My brother usually chose Liu Kang, because most of his special moves were easy forward-forward-button inputs, and he developed a tactic of simply spamming his special moves over and over again. And as stupid as it sounds, we couldn&#39;t beat him. He&#39;d rack up 50-win streaks on us at times (as I swapped the controller with the younger one after each game), which actually allowed him to fight Noob Saibot in the SNES port. After a while I was tired of losing to that playstyle, and just started practicing the game as much as I could w

The best memory I had is that it had a purple tint, and there were these screens that would pop up at the bottom corner of the screen that would be all static then a person would show up on the screen and talk.

Id still like to be able to use this as a traditional computer at times.</p> <p>While cleaning my room I came across my family&#39;s old Alienware gaming PC. These days its not really up for many modern games, however it can still run lots of gamecube games via dolphin emulator, and I am sure other consoles would be possible as well! What I am wondering is whether or not there is a way I can set Windows 10 up to be operated by just a controller. Something like controller the cursor with a joystick, left/right click with A/B for example, and a way to bring up a virtual keyboard when clicking on a text box in the same way that a game console usually does. If this isnt really something that is realistic i am willing to look into installing an all new OS (I&#39;ve seen Batocera recommended a lot and it looks lovely). My main quest
