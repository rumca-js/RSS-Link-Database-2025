The bot said i could wait for someone to chat and i would get a mail when someone would be available. In 3 days, no one came to chat and i got no mail. Their support page gives errors, seemingly there&#39;s no-one there.<br/> But their server is still working, black friday deal, 6 months unlimited for 17.50 E since 2 years now so very cheap.
