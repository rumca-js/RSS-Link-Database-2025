<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello i&#39;m new to Usenet I went with Eweka for 6 months as one of my providers and did a 3-day trial with Hitnews. They have offered me a coupon for 50% off and was just curious would that be a good deal or should I just stick with one provider? They both would be the unlimited plan. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kaian1723"> /u/Kaian1723 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1intxy5/providers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1intxy5/providers/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I asked a question about their octane vpn which does not work anymore and will be closed in june. The bot said i could wait for someone to chat and i would get a mail when someone would be available. In 3 days, no one came to chat and i got no mail. Their support page gives errors, seemingly there&#39;s no-one there.<br/> But their server is still working, black friday deal, 6 months unlimited for 17.50 E since 2 years now so very cheap. Any thundernews users here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JeanCremers"> /u/JeanCremers </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1inrem4/thundernews_support_does_not_react_anymore_seems/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1inrem4/thundernews_support_does_not_react_anymore_seems/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A long time ago people were suggesting Frugal Usenet, so I got a subscription and have been very happy with it for a while.</p> <p>A few months ago I&#39;ve noticed that many files were incomplete, even ones that were about a month old.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a common problem across different providers or if it&#39;s isolated to Frugal.</p> <p>My subscription to Frugal expired a week or so ago and I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s a better alternative for an affordable provider with good retention and SSL.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeremy_Dewitte"> /u/Jeremy_Dewitte </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1inh3yg/is_there_a_new_favorite_provider/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1inh3yg/is_there_a_new_favorite_provider/">[comments]</a></span>
