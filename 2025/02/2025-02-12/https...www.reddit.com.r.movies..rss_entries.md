<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>“What’s the most you ever lost on a coin toss?”</p> <p>What a movie. An allegorical piece of art that doesn&#39;t follow the conventional storytelling of a thriller/action. It takes us on a classic cat-and-mouse journey throughout the first 2 acts of the film. Those 2 acts providing you with a constant feeling of suspense and dread. No movie I&#39;ve seen has been able to keep me on my toes as much as this one.</p> <p>The tone gets set right off the bat with a brutal first kill, followed by a very clean, calm kill. This shows us Javier&#39;s character as a brutal and dangerous villain, yet being portrayed as a calm, airy person. That drastic contrast between the chaotic and cruel plot to go with the calm, tranquil atmosphere is such a unique yet effective mix and keeps you glued to the screen, wanting more.</p> <p>This clever contrast of two completely different feelings is portrayed many times throughout the film. We get a more chaotic, tense &quot;

## Peter Sarsgaard in Jarhead (2005)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently watched this again and thought Sarsgaard&#39;s performance after the Major (Dennis Haysbert) denies both of them the shot was the peak of the movie. Troy, played by Saarsgard, immediately goes into a rage and is literally in tears because of how badly he wanted his first kill. </p> <p>It goes to show you that the movie didn&#39;t even need a climatic, intense sniper shot for it to be an explosive scene because Sarsgaard and Haysbert&#39;s acting was <em>So on point</em> </p> <p>It&#39;s obvious that Marine snipers need more restraint than this, but I suppose that&#39;s sort of beside the point. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gilette_bayonete"> /u/gilette_bayonete </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1inoh3r/peter_sarsgaard_in_jarhead_2005/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1inoh3r/peter_sarsgaard_in_jarhead_20

He falls in love with a woman that&#39;s professional driver and car racer which I believe his dad is also a former pro racer. (Edit: Spoiler removed)</p> <p>Rings any bell ? It&#39;s not a mainstream movie at all. I&#39;ve seen it somewhere in the 2015-2020 era at this little cinema club that presents mostly.

Is this some sort of movie trope like hanging up phone calls without saying goodbye? Why is this? Does it seem to be more &quot;action oriented&quot; than using a normal brushing motion?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What are some movies you&#39;ve enjoyed with sad or anxious characters? I mean movies that take a light and humorous approach to dealing with issues like anxiety, depression, loss, and other similar issues. I recently saw a film about loss but the movie was way too depressing and I did not finish watching it, so got me thinking that it&#39;s best to try to find films that while they let you face the reality the approach is not all serious and humorless.</p> <p>Little Miss Sunshine does it so well. I mean it deals with <span class="md-spoiler-text">suicide attempt</span>for God&#39;s sakes, that&#39;s how it begins! Not exactly funny. Serious stuff.

When I was younger, I loved movies, watched many, and generally kept up with them and watched many of the classics and most notable movies.

Whether it be beautifully shot, a fantastic and engaging story, emotional or impactful, the reasoning behind it is up to you. Please keep your list to ideally around 5 movies, and please no MCU or other superhero movies (no hate whatsoever! just not my thing). This doesn&#39;t have to be your *personal* top 5 of the last 20 years, just movies you think are particularly important and should be watched. If I may sway your limited choices/recommendations in a particular direction, I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just had the privilege of watching this film all the way through for the first time last night. Haven’t stopped thinking about it since, the main thing for me was just the atmosphere of it all. The setting of them being in Antarctica with nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, is practically perfect for a horror movie. Arguably the best character (and in general) writing I’ve seen from a horror movie, they did everything right that they could, they were a group of scientists and they all acted like it. All came up with perfect plans to survive and figure out the monster. The movie didn’t have to rely on dumb characters to move the plot forward, they instead gave us incredibly smart characters that ended up having no choice but to fail in the end. Plus that ending, so masterfully done, cliffhangers suck until it’s something like that. Keeps you thinking about the movie long, long after you’re done watching it. Absolute 10/10 in my book.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically, back in 1997 after Peter Jackson&#39;s original version of King Kong got cancelled, Jackson moved onto Lord of the Rings when it was already set up at Miramax. It was basically envisioned as this: one Hobbit film, then two Lord of the Rings films under Miramax but UA actually owned the film rights to The Hobbit so they basically just decided to do two Lord of the Rings films and do The Hobbit down the road as a prequel.</p> <p>Well, Peter Jackson tried to talk Miramax into doing three films but there were intent on only doing two Lord of the Rings films, the first film covering Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers and the second film covering Return of the King. And Jackson agreed to it for a while. Then somehow during pre-production, Disney CEO Michael Eisner looked at the budget which was $75M a piece for these two films. So basically, after that: Miramax wanted to tell the whole story all in one film. Here&#39;s what changes that Ja
