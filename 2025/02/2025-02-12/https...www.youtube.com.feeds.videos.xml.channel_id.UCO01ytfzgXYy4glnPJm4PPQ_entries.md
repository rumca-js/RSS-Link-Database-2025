Today on the Matt Walsh Show, out-of-control, tyrannical, power-hungry judges are attempting to override Trump and claim total control over the executive branch. We’ll talk about why Trump's only choice is to ignore the lawless orders these judges are issuing and dare them to do something about it. Also, JD Vance attends a summit on AI. He says the Trump Administration plans to take the lead on AI, which is good. But taking the lead also means putting up guardrails. And a left-wing protest goes wildly off the rails in truly horrifying ways, that I will force you to witness. And the morbidly obese woman suing Lyft made an appearance on The Breakfast Club. Her whole case—and their furniture—fell apart almost immediately.
