<p>Snowflake on Wednesday announced the public preview of Cortex Agents, a set of APIs built on top of the Snowflake Intelligence platform, a low-code offering that was first <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3603375/snowflake-bares-its-agentic-ai-plans-by-showcasing-its-intelligence-platform.html">launched</a> in November at Build, the company’s annual developer conference.</p>



<p>Asked at a press and analyst briefing held earlier this week how the most recent launch differs from what was introduced at Build, Baris Gultekin, head of AI at Snowflake, responded, “it is not a repeat” and that the agents are what Software Intelligence, which will be in private preview soon, builds on.</p>

<p>I’ve been developing software for many years now. Decades. I’ve learned a lot along the way, and I dare to think that I’ve collected some wisdom about software development worth sharing with others. At some point, you think “Yeah, I’ve got a grip on this thing.”<br><br>And every once in a while, you have some revelation that is the culmination of what you’ve learned along the way. I’ll never forget the moment I understood dependency injection. <em>Of</em> <em>course</em> you would want to pass in an abstraction rather than create an implementation!<br><br>I had a similar revelation this week. I’m sure there are plenty of sager developers among you who have already figured this out, but it struc

<p>Rust shares many concepts with other languages intended for systems programming. For instance, Rust distinguishes between memory allocated from the stack and memory allocated from the heap. It also ensures that variables declared within a scope are unavailable outside of that scope.</p>



<p>But Rust implements these behaviors in its own way, with significant implications for how memory management works. Rust uses a variety of <em>ownership</em> metaphors to describe how resources are created, retained, and disposed of during a program’s lifetime. Learning how to work with Rust’s concept of ownership is an important rite of initiation for Rust programmers. This quick guide will help you get st

<p>Microsoft Threat Intelligence in December observed a “threat actor” using a publicly available ASP.NET machine key to inject malicious code and fetch the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/november-2024%E2%80%93godzilla-webshell-analyst-note.pdf">Godzilla</a> post-exploitation framework, a “backdoor” web shell used by intruders to execute commands and manipulate files. The company then identified more than 3,000 publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys—i.e., keys that were disclosed in code documentation and repositories—that could be used in these types of attacks, called ViewState code injection attacks.</p>



<p>In response, Microsoft Threat Intelligence is warning organization
