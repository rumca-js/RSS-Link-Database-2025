## Could youtube monitoring free speech? Comments and deletions of channels without violations?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing some researching because I&#39;m trying to understand why all of a sudden youtube is taking away comment&#39;s that are morale, educational and none threatening? Just comment&#39;s that have a difference of opinion? Are we being monitored? Has youtube allowed an agency to come in and dictate how we should think? I&#39;ve had comment&#39;s taking away that aren&#39;t in any violation. All my comment&#39;s have a morale high road and I will comment on comment&#39;s that show hate, and racism and educate them in a humble and politically correct manner. I only once used the word s#it but so did many other commenter&#39;s, including the content creator. And yet I&#39;m flagged? Im not accusing youtube of anything. However I have reservations on the direction youtube is taking. Im not the only one who feels this way. There are other reddit pages that express thoughts on suppression of freedom of speech in youtube comment&#39;s and video

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>YouTube needs to change their commercial volume settings. If a 5 second commercial is coming on every couple of minutes, there is no reason it should be playing at twice or three times the volume of the movie. My ears do not deserve this. Plus, if I remove my AirPods, the sound will either play out loud or pause the movie and then I have to press play. </p> <p>This is a matter of bad setup on YouTube team&#39;s part. Any app should have good functionality and app developers should listen to consumer responses, especially when it has been such a long-term and detrimental issue such as the number of complaints over many years of people&#39;s eardrums being blasted by the commercial volume. Very disappointed in YouTube. Saw that one person had a doctor confirm their ear damage was because of loud volume and it happened directly after a very loud YouTube commercial. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/a
