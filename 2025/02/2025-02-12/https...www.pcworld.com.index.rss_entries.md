<p>Smart entry locks are the biggest improvement to home security since the lock-and-key system was invented more than a thousand years ago. In many cases, smart locks dispense with physical keys altogether in favor of PINs, fingerprints, NFC tags, smartphone apps–even your smartphone or smart watch. And with some of the latest models, you can even unlock your door with just your face! Smart locks deliver lots of other benefits, too.</p>



<p>They invariably have logging systems, so you can keep track of who’s coming and going–and when. That’s incredibly useful whether you have a teenager who tends to break curfew or merely want to give temporary access to houseguests, service providers, or Airbnb guests. Smart locks are an incredible upgrade over the old way of doing things, and these are our top picks in several categories.</p>

<p>If you’re like me and you consistently forget to turn off your lights, only to remember them when you’re cozy in bed, then you might benefit from upgrading to smart bulbs. Smart bulbs are a great first step for any home because they’re inexpensive yet so practical.</p>



<p>Right now, you can get this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant/dp/B07QWB3J8W/">4-pack of Philips Hue 60W smart LED bulbs for just $37 on Amazon</a>, which is 26 percent off its usual $50. At a little over $9 per bulb, you might be balking — but you’d be surprised how useful these can be. Once you try, you’ll never go back.</p>



<p>These soft white LED bulbs only use 10W each but offer equivalent brightness to 60W incandescents. They’re dimmable, too, so they’re versatile for any space in your home, whether that’s your living room, dining table,

<p>Old Faithful is going off again. Acer’s Nitro V is consistently one of the best-selling gaming laptops out there, because it offers some solid specs that can often be found well below the $1,000 mark. Today you can get it with a 13th-gen Core i7 processor, an RTX 4060 graphics card, and 16GB of RAM <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266896713942">for just $639.99 on eBay</a>.</p>



<p>That’s a pretty fantastic price for a mid-range gaming laptop, even if it is a refurbished model. (It comes with a two-year warranty from Allstate.) Other highlights include a 512GB SSD, a 15.6-inch screen with a zippy 144Hz refresh rate, and a backlit keyboard. Those specs should be more than enough to play the latest games, though graphically intense titles (like the recent <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>) might need some lower graphics settings.</p>

<p>You know about captcha tests, right? The anti-bot checks that can be found all over the internet, usually when you log into accounts or post comments? The picture puzzles and mysterious symbol sequences that are supposed to weed out the bots from humans?</p>



<p>Turns out, those captcha tests have been pretty useful for a while now. Modern bots have long been able to outsmart many captcha tests, and it’s getting worse thanks to the proliferation of AI.</p>



<p>So, why are there still so many captchas on the web? Apparently, they serve a different purpose now. Instead of identifying and blocking bots, they’re being used to collect user data, according to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsBP21-XpI">YouTube channel named Chuppl</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106717-google-recaptcha-not-only-useless-also-basically-spywar

<p>First of all, there is no need to panic about this date. Windows 10 will theoretically continue to run indefinitely, as Microsoft is not discontinuing the functionality of the operating system, there will “only” be no more updates from November. This means that you can continue to use Windows 10 in principle, but no more security gaps will be closed, for example.</p>

<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-set-finalize-first-custom-chip-design-this-year-2025-02-10/">Reuters</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/a-i/316979/openai-is-reportedly-working-on-first-in-house-ai-chip">Thurrott</a>), OpenAI could finalize the design of its first 3nm AI chip in the coming months, with the goal of starting mass production at TSMC in 2026.</p>



<p>The chip is being developed by a team of 40 OpenAI employees in collaboration with Broadcom. The project is being led by Richard Ho, OpenAI’s new head of hardware, who previously worked on solutions for Google’s infrastructure and cloud services.</p>



<p>According to Reuters, OpenAI’s chip will be able to both train and run AI models, but initially it’ll be used mainly for inference (running AI models) and to a limited extent with

<p>USB-C is the one connection to rule them all. Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can act as USB hub, giving you additional ports for connecting various USB devices, but the monitor’s USB-C port can also serve as a video-input alternative to HDMI or DisplayPort; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>



<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface. See our buyers’ guide below our recommendations to better understand the nuances.</p>

<p>Hard drives, with physically spinning platters, are kind of a thing of the past for most PC users. I don’t think I’ve seen a new laptop that uses a hard drive over an SSD in years, even in the ultra-budget category. But if you need absolutely outrageous amounts of disk space for long-term storage purposes, you still can’t beat an HDD.</p>



<p>And right now, you can get a gargantuan 28TB hard drive — <em>yes, twenty-eight terabytes</em> — <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296879436001">on eBay for $389.99</a>.</p>



<p>That’s so much storage that it’s hard for me to even imagine. I think every piece of information I’ve ever recorded in my life — every photo, video, article, novel, and hastily-completed college essay — wouldn’t fill up 28TB. According to some napkin math, I could fit all 400+ PC games in my Steam collection on it several times over. Of co

<p>Adobe said today that it’s bringing AI-generated video, aka the Firefly Video Model, to Adobe Premiere Pro plus its Firefly generative art service. Unlike its generative AI image capabilities, however, it won’t be free.</p>



<p>AI-generated video has been available for months. In December, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2551773/openai-releases-sora-its-ai-powered-video-generator.html">OpenAI released Sora</a>, its ability to craft AI video clips of several seconds from a text prompt.

<p>Despite being the new hotness in online multiplayer, I haven’t been especially grabbed by <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Maybe it’s my lack of excitement for Marvel properties post-Endgame, maybe I’m wary of a free-to-play game from NetEase getting its pernicious hooks in me. Maybe I was just so betrayed by <em>Overwatch 2 </em>that I’m off the idea of a team-based shooter altogether.</p>



<p>But I’ll tell you what <em>Marvel Rivals </em>can do to get my attention: Give me that rug that <em>Overwatch 2</em> pulled out from under me. And a new rumor says it might do just that. </p>

<p>Picture this: You’ve just invested in a smart battery-powered camera to bring your home security into the 21st century. Installation is a breeze; there are no wires to worry about. You just charge it up and stick it wherever you see fit. It has a sensor, and it’ll automatically record clips whenever it detects movement.</p>



<p>Later that day, you miss a parcel, the driver has left it “somewhere safe” but you can’t find it. No problem, your new camera will have picked it up. So, you go to check the footage, but the sensor triggered too late and the recording ended too early. You still have no idea where the package is. It’s not ideal.</p>



<p>Eventually, you find it, but it’s pretty irritating that your camera couldn’t help. So, you decide to activate the always-on continuous recording mode. Then, the reality sets in. Your storage is completely full af
