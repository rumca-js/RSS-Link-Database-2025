I believe that SEO remains my biggest challenge/opportunity for customer acquisition at the moment, but I wanted to ask specifically if my product will inherently always have pages not indexed because of similar content.</p> <p>Background: I and the businesses I work with can publish a recurring event, which creates 10 different events/pages with the same information except for the event dates. The page title is differentiated because of the dates, and the URL slug has the unique date as well.</p> <p>What I&#39;m currently seeing is 36% of my pages fall under the &quot;Discovered - Currently Not Indexed&quot; bucket. When recurring events used to only be 5 weeks out, this was closer to 20%. Last index request was Feb 1. Do you think this is just because there are too many pages and google didn&#39;t get around to indexing them all, or becaus

I followed all best practices, like:</p> <ul> <li>DNS, CDN, and mail updates</li> <li>301 redirects</li> <li>SEO structure review</li> <li>Setting up and updating Search Console, Analytics, GTM, etc.</li> <li>Submitting sitemaps and updating robots.txt</li> <li>Using the Site Migration tool in Search Console</li> </ul> <p>Now, our Search Console has been showing <em>&quot;The site is currently moving to...&quot;</em> for the last three months.</p> <p>During this process, we managed to keep our rankings on the old domain for about a month.

What you’ll get will be superficial and lacking true insight.</li> <li>What you can really do is ask a model to create text abstract-by-abstract and go through multiple feedback iterations anyway.</li> <li>As for tools (again, I mean Jasper, Copyai, and others of that kind—not fine-tuning systems, etc.), I think they are totally useless.
