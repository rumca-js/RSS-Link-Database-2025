<p>Fremont adopts sweeping law that bans camping on public property and makes ‘aiding, abetting’ encampments illegal</p><p>A northern California city passed a law targeting unhoused people that will ban camping on public property and make “permitting, aiding, [or] abetting” encampments illegal – a provision that has caused worry among non-profits and advocates.</p><p>The city council in Fremont, California, adopted the sweeping new ordinance – which has been described as one of the strictest in the state – on Tuesday with Fremont’s mayor arguing such action was necessary to ensure residents’ health and safety in the Bay Area community of 226,000. City officials were insistent that the law would not be used to target aid workers, but declined to clarify that point in the ordinance itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/fremont-california-unhoused-law">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Court theatre, London<br></strong>A wonderfully precise ensemble cast make this sci-fi vision of resurrection and immortality stab directly at the heart</p><p>What makes a life? Kandinsky theatre company’s bruising sci-fi drama sweeps us thrillingly from 1803, when scientists electrocute a corpse to simulate stuttering new life, to 2074, when private tech companies experiment with downloading brain scans of the dead to infallible new bodies. A smartly composed exploration of greed, loss and the loneliness of eternity, More Life is an incredibly human play about technology.</p><p>Victor (Marc Elliott) is our futuristic Frankenstein, a bulldozing consultant obsessed with progress, preservation and a dead woman he hopes will be the first success in his company’s experiments. As Vic brings Bridget (Alison Halstead) to a kind of life, the wonderfully precise ensemble watches as she tries on her new body. Under James Yeatman’s delicate direction, the voice is dislocated, a

<p><strong>Courtauld Gallery, London<br></strong>Is there an ulterior motive to this drearily grand exhibition of paintings borrowed from a Swiss collection? Could it be to show how vastly superior the Courtauld’s own works are?</p><p>The bland title of this show reads a bit like a confession, in terms of how little it has to say. Goya to Impressionism – so? Why do we need to see the troubled Spanish painter of war and witchcraft juxtaposed with soft scenes by Renoir and Sisley? No reason, except they all belong to a collection whose home in Winterthur, Switzerland, is closed for renovation, meaning the Courtauld can borrow them as a job lot. The trouble is that the Oskar Reinhart Collection is too similar to the Courtauld’s own to be an overly exciting proposition.</p><p>Both hoards were gathered in the early-20th century by wealthy private collectors with a penchant for French art of the late 1800s, yet by and large Samuel Courtauld got the best stuff.

<p><strong>Orange Tree theatre, London<br></strong>There are laugh-aloud gags and spiky dialogue as Roger Allam and Peter Forbes star in Howard Brenton’s play about the 1942 encounter</p><p>In the 1970s, Howard Brenton wrote The Churchill Play, provoking furious newspaper pieces and a testy TV encounter with Melvyn Bragg. In a future (1984) totalitarian Britain, internees at the Churchill internment camp staged a play in which the second world war leader rose from lying in state to endure insults including: “People won the war. He just got pissed with Stalin.”</p><p>That reference was to peace conferences from 1943-45, also including President Roosevelt. But, five decades on, Brenton has written about a lesser-known, frequently inebriated August 1942 encounter between the British and Russian leaders at a time when, as Churchill in Moscow presents it, each ally feared the other was about to lose to Hitler.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/feb/12/churchill-in-moscow-

But to the surprise of some supporters, it took half an hour for anyone in the environment-rooted party to mention the climate.</p><p>Germany’s Greens are fighting to hold on to power after four years in a coalition government where they have been pilloried by other parties, and during which their core issue of climate action has slipped down the political agenda. Though the party is still far from being considered a <em>Volkspartei</em> – a main party whose voters span demographic groups and issues – the Greens have sought to boost their mainstream appeal with talk of beefing up security and bringing down rents and bills.</p> <a href="https://www.th

<p>This tragically unfinished account of the Russian invasion of Ukraine bears witness to both grave crimes and the strength of the human spirit</p><p>It is expected that a book review will be written with some degree of critical distance, but, in this case, distance is not possible. On 27 June, 2023, Victoria Amelina, author of Looking at Women Looking at War, was in a restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk when it was hit by a Russian missile. She died of her injuries a few days later, leaving the book she was working on unfinished. Shock and grief at her killing continues to reverberate among those close to her, and among her wider circle of friends, of whom I was one. She was 37 and the mother of a young son.</p><p>The full-scale Russian invasion transformed every aspect of Amelina’s life. At the beginning of the war she threw herself into humanitarian work, as refugees from the east and south arrived in her home city of Lviv. But she soon began to realise that sh

<p>The 1975 adaptation of Ira Levin’s influential sci-fi thriller has its share of unnerving moments but its brainwashed housewives concept is still in search of a better vehicle</p><p>The funniest running joke in The Stepford Wives, a horror/satire about a village teeming with glamorous homemakers with pristine kitchens and serene grins, is that the men are all wildly overmatched. They’re like the nerds who got the prom queens, except even nerds have an expected level of intelligence and personality, however socially awkward they might appear. These drips are better understood as nondescript: a few of them are balding and another has a speech impediment, but they are united mostly in feeling entitled to the docile beauty their junior executive salaries should afford them. When two women new to town overhear a Stepford wife in the throes of passion – “You’re the king, Frank!” – they know something’s up.</p><p>Adapted from novelist Ira Levin’s follow-up to Rosemary’s Baby, The Stepfor

<p>Before the German club face Celtic in a Champions League playoff we recount a rich history that goes back decades </p><p>Given Bayern Munich’s lengthy and storied history in European competition, it may come as no surprise that they have jousted with Scottish clubs over several decades. But the variation and drama attached to many of those fixtures gives cause for contemplation as the German team return to Glasgow for a Champions League playoff against Celtic.</p><p>Bayern are heavy favourites to progress, largely because of the economic tilt towards clubs of their standing in the modern era. It was not always thus, however, as a glance at the record books outlines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/12/bayern-munich-celtic-champions-league-play-offs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plus: clubs making big profits on ageing players and the WSL teams playing each other four times in 13 days</p><p><strong>“Magdeburg were top of the 2.Bundesliga on Friday night after 19 games of the season … despite not having won a single home game,”</strong> wrote James Plain a couple of weeks ago. <strong>“It should have been hung in the Louvre – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jan/28/we-wont-come-again-dazed-visitors-fed-up-with-overcrowded-louvre-paris">crowds notwithstanding</a>.

When it comes to a romantic meal, we can plan ahead, make an effort and present something a bit special or, more often than not, it’s a mad dash to the kitchen and a ready, steady, cook approach. Duck legs will probably require a trip to the butchers, but the potato hash can be made with things you probably have at home already (or can easily find at the corner shop). Whatever your approach, the result must be delicious enough to say those three precious words: I love you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/12/spiced-duck-legs-greek-potato-hash-honey-co-recipes-valentines-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This account of humanity’s magical yet toxic relationship with rocks and minerals is filled with glittering details</p><p>One summer, a couple of millennia ago, the 14-year-old high priest of a meteor-worshiping cult in Syria learned that his cousin, Emperor Caracalla of Rome, had died and that he was to be installed in his place. The teenage priest – later known as Emperor Elagabalus – brought his cult’s sacred stone with him to the capital, where he gave it a goddess for a bride, built it an enormous temple on the Palatine Hill, and ordered Romans to worship it above all other deities. His rule was brief. After four wild years, he was beheaded by his own soldiers and his body was dumped in a sewer. As for the stone, its final resting place is unknown.</p><p>Rocks, minerals, metals – these materials from the depths of the Earth and from distant space – have inspired reverence and horror, wonder and greed.

She had painted a picture of London, a city she had never been to, as a place of wonders.</p><p>“You won’t need to use your legs to walk there – they have machines that move for you,” she said. My eyes bulged with excitement. I had never seen such machines on the streets of Addis Ababa.

<p>Pep Guardiola had a plan with his Norwegian striker at the centre, but it was no match for Carlo Ancelotti’s aura</p><p>Almost, but also, somehow, nowhere near. For Manchester City this was once again an exercise in how to fall apart. For an hour at the Etihad Stadium, City became a flickering version of their best selves, driven on by a selection of creaking first-choice defensive parts lashed together and made to march four abreast into the sun for as long as their limbs could stand.</p><p>By the time Real Madrid scored their first goal of this game on 60 minutes, half of that string‑and‑brown‑paper back four had either gone off or was already limping. Rico Lewis was being twirled around the place by Vinícius Júnior like a child at a wedding reception disco. And half an hour later, as Jude Bellingham scored to make it 3-2 to Madrid, City’s hopes of making the post‑playoff second knockout phase of this competition had narrowed to a fine point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

Our critic sees a spine, a hand, an owl, a sea monster – or does he?</p><p>Psychedelic art has an image problem. Picture it and you may see tie-dyed fabrics, muzzy portraits of Jimi Hendrix, endless vistas of magenta. By the end of the 1960s, the wave of drug experimentation that started with Aldous Huxley and the beat generation had inspired a lot of great music – but very little good art.</p><p>The writer and artist Henri Michaux had several advantages that helped him transcend all that mediocrity. He was born in Belgium – not California – in 1899 and lived an avant garde life in Paris where in the 1920s he was photographed by Claude Cahun and hung out with the surrealists. He inherited a tradition of bohemian drug experimentation that went right back to poet Charles Baudelaire and his fellow members of the Hashish Eaters Club, Victor Hugo and
