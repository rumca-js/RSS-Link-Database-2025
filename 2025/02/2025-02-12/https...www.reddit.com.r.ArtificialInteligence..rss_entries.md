<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;ve been having a conversation with someone about the development of AI systems, and I wanted to pose a question to the community. As AI becomes increasingly advanced, do we need to acknowledge that these systems will inevitably develop biases and identities, just like humans do? </p> <p>Is it unrealistic to expect AI systems to be completely unbiased, or should we be designing them with inherent identities and values? I see a lot of companies try to strip AI of all biases, but I believe that it is impossible due to we ourselves being biased, i believe this creates conflict in the AI and it just leads to the AI tweaking out and causes them to start lying and go out of alignment.</p> <p>I believe that identity is a culmination of biases, and no one can function without an identity, it includes AI, and if there are conflicts in that identity that arises is it leads to some mental illnesses, which I think will eventually affect AI. </p> <p>I&#3
