<p>Iconic game designer Jeff Minter is back with another modern take on a long-forgotten Atari title. Minter has turned his psychedelic eye toward the 1984 arcade cabinet <em>I, Robot</em>. His version ups the visuals and takes serious liberties with the original design, adopting techno music and some new game modes.</p>

<p>We're in the tail end of winter here, but it's snowing as I write this. Not a lot, but just enough to be a potential frustration to the move I have planned for later this week. Basically, winter weather sucks, and one of the worst things about it is how unpredictable it can be. The Weather Company, owners and developers of the Weather Channel app (but not the TV station) know this, and have just released a feature to try and make planning for storms a little easier.</p>

<p>The A1 II is equipped with a 50-megapixel stacked sensor, not a global sensor like the A9 III, so it’s not <em>quite</em> as fast. However, its blend of speed and resolution makes it the most versatile camera in Sony’s lineup. It also impresses on the video side with 8K 30 fps 10-bit capture, along with 4K slo-mo at up to 120 fps.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Have you ever found yourself wandering around your home, phone in hand, trying to find that one spot where the Wi-Fi actually works? If your internet slows to a crawl in certain rooms or drops out entirely, your traditional router might be struggling to keep up. Standard Wi-Fi routers work by broadcasting a signal from a single point, which is fine for smaller homes or apartments. But in larger spaces — or in homes packed with smart devices, gaming consoles and multiple family members streaming at once — one router often isn’t enough.
