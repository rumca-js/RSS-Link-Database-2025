<p><strong>Updated on February 12, 2025:</strong> As of yesterday, Microsoft has silently forced all PCs running Windows 10 21H2 and Windows 10 22H2 to install the new Outlook app. Our original story that anticipated this move, which you can read below, has been updated accordingly.</p>

<p>For several months now, Microsoft has been urging Windows users to switch over to the new Outlook app, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2551776/classic-outlook-gets-an-official-death-date-microsoft.html">classic Outlook recently getting an official “death date”</a>.

<p>VLC isn’t just one of the most capable video player apps out there, but one of the most popular PC apps of all time. It’s entirely free, it’s open-source, and it’s so widely loved by nearly everyone. No surprise that it’s one of our top picks for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/443089/best-free-software-for-pc.html">best free PC software</a>.</p>



<p>The thing is, most people just use it to play video files. It handles most video formats and codecs right out of the box, so it’s reliable and effective. But it can do so much more than that.</p>



<p>VLC has so many interesting features, like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2575337/vlc-celebrates-6-billion-downloads-with-ai-subtitles.html">upcoming ability to generate subtitles on the fly using AI</a>. Sadly, a lot of these features have flown under the radar and people don’t know abo

<p>There’s no escape. Artificial intelligence is creeping into Windows, and with it comes increased OS storage requirements.</p>



<p>For a long time, the minimum storage spec for Windows 11 was 64GB. With <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2382750/7-vital-things-to-know-before-buying-a-windows-copilot-laptop.html">newer Copilot+ PCs</a>, that’s been bumped up to 256GB. But it doesn’t end here. This is just for the OS itself. As more developers implement AI models into their apps, you’re going to need <em>even more storage</em> — to handle the system <em>and</em> the apps.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what all this means and why it’s happening. If you want to use system AI features (like Windows Recall) and locally hosted generative AI models (like DeepSeek) and diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion), then you <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/24
