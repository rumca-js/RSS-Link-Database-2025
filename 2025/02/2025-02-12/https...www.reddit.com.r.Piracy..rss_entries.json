Using my credit card and after authentication it just drops me back to the checkout. I emailed the admin and they suggested I buy a voucher from a reseller, filesharingshop.com. </p> <p>Off I go to filesharingshop. Choosing 30 day I select credit card but I get \u2018no options are available in your country\u2019 so I\u2019m limited to PayPal. Using this option I\u2019m presented a PayPal invoice to pay, but the details are suspicious as the company name, address and email don\u2019t say filesharingshop. In fact they seem to almost be randomly generated as the address is not real and the logo is generated. Also, it seems to rotate if I try again in 30 mins it\u2019ll be a different business and PayPal invoice emails go to different people. Is it safe? Any other ways to pay for fakirdebrid?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",

Hell, I had it running well from an external drive to my laptop with a decent graphics card.</p> <p>I decided to (support the developers), bought a Steam key and installed on the main PC first. I am horrified at how butt it is running. First, it didn&#39;t pre-load the textures like the FG install, then it stuttered and dropped to single digit frames so often I turned it off. Literally unplayable, texture loading every two seconds. </p> <p>Is the Steam game install responsible? Are there FG files left-over causing a conflict?

Naturally, racing games on a keyboard proved to be too difficult. And of course i cannot afford a steering setup. So i installed a PC remote application on my mobile phone and started using my phone as a steering wheel for playing games using the phone&#39;s gyroscope.

However, I installed FH4 from Fitgirl yesterday and when i opened the Controls menu, <em>there was no wheel tab</em>, only a controller and a keyboard option. After that, I installed an Xbox360 emulator to make my phone, which was emulating a vjoy device, emulate an xbox 360 controller as well.
