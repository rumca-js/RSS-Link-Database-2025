## Anyone used Fakirdebrid and filesharingshop.com?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just found Fakirdebrid and it seems to fit my needs for premium downloads and torrent however I can’t seem to checkout. Using my credit card and after authentication it just drops me back to the checkout. I emailed the admin and they suggested I buy a voucher from a reseller, filesharingshop.com. </p> <p>Off I go to filesharingshop. Choosing 30 day I select credit card but I get ‘no options are available in your country’ so I’m limited to PayPal. Using this option I’m presented a PayPal invoice to pay, but the details are suspicious as the company name, address and email don’t say filesharingshop. In fact they seem to almost be randomly generated as the address is not real and the logo is generated. Also, it seems to rotate if I try again in 30 mins it’ll be a different business and PayPal invoice emails go to different people. Is it safe? Any other ways to pay for fakirdebrid?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I borrowed FFVII Rebirth from the internet and have had it running great on steamdeck (caveats of course), and the main PC with 3060ti. Hell, I had it running well from an external drive to my laptop with a decent graphics card.</p> <p>I decided to (support the developers), bought a Steam key and installed on the main PC first. I am horrified at how butt it is running. First, it didn&#39;t pre-load the textures like the FG install, then it stuttered and dropped to single digit frames so often I turned it off. Literally unplayable, texture loading every two seconds. </p> <p>Is the Steam game install responsible? Are there FG files left-over causing a conflict? Help me understand this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asault2"> /u/asault2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1io40a9/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth_fitgirl_runs_better/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="h

Even then, I need help.</p> <p>I think my intentions are very clear, I just don&#39;t know how to get it done. NewPipe doesn&#39;t work anymore for this and of the multiple video downloader I tried, not a single one got this stupid job done. I saw many people bringing up Tampermonkey, but I genuinely have no clue how to get that stuff working (digital stuff really isn&#39;t my strongest skillset, I&#39;m actually glad to be able to work with Exel at least). I also don&#39;t really want to try to create another account in a different country, I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;d work out since my VPN has kinda been disappointing me with any attempt at getting through local restrictions.</p> <p>So yeah, if anyone can help me I&#39;d be very thankful</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello pirates. I have run into a very peculiar problem. So i have a PC and i recently started playing a lot of racing games. Naturally, racing games on a keyboard proved to be too difficult. And of course i cannot afford a steering setup. So i installed a PC remote application on my mobile phone and started using my phone as a steering wheel for playing games using the phone&#39;s gyroscope. Now this arrangement worked perfectly fine with most games. I used to go to Options/Settings&gt;Controls&gt;Wheel and the game would detect my phone as a steering wheel. However, I installed FH4 from Fitgirl yesterday and when i opened the Controls menu, <em>there was no wheel tab</em>, only a controller and a keyboard option. After that, I installed an Xbox360 emulator to make my phone, which was emulating a vjoy device, emulate an xbox 360 controller as well. Then i rebinded the Left Trigger/stick with my phone&#39;s gyroscope for the x axis. But when i started
