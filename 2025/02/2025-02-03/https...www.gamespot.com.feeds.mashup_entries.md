<p>With tariffs by the US set to take effect on Tuesday, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expressed concern about how they may affect the video game industry. In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/esa-statement-on-proposed-tariffs/">statement on its website</a>, the ESA warned that import taxes on gaming devices would "negatively impact hundreds of millions of Americans."</p><p>The ESA, the trade association representing most of the major publishers in gaming, said that tariffs would "harm the [game] industry’s significant contributions to the US economy." The ESA ended the statement by saying it was looking forward to "working with the [Trump] Administration and Congress to find ways to sustain the economic growth" supported by the game industry. According to the ESA, total video game sales in the US <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-consumer-spending-on-video-games-totaled-58-7-billion-in-2024/">reached $58.7 billion in 2024</a>.</p><p>The US government is set to enact

<p>Civilization VII reviews have gone live, and the new entry in the series is proving to be quite divisive with critics. A 4X turn-based strategy game, Civilization VII offers a familiar foundation for returning players, as you'll pick an influential leader from human history, expand an empire through various eras, and aim to reach multiple societal milestones along the way.</p><p>The difference here is that developer Firaxis shakes up that formula with big changes, with these tweaks ranging from impactful to possibly controversial for veterans of the series. It's also worth noting that all of these reviews were done on PC, the platform that's generally considered to be the best for traditional 4X strategy games like this. The game is also coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch, so it remains to be seen how well the experience translates to consoles.</p><p>"For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through eac

<p>Microsoft has embarked on a new multiplatform direction for several of its Xbox games, and former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden believes that this new initiative could work in the company's favor if handled correctly--much like it has for Sega. Layden believes that Microsoft can benefit from having a wider market to sell its games to as part of its new multiplatform strategy, but the downside to this is that it could possibly make it harder for the company to attract more people to its platform.</p><p>"Multiplatform is a strategy, particularly in a world where the cost of development is increasing dramatically," Layden said to YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/UAcM-xmUegs?t=2968">Kiwi Talks</a>. "Multiplatform means widening your addressable market, as the marketing guys say. How do you create the fear of missing out, trying to do that by bringing everyone to your platform? Saying, 'If you're not here you're missing out,' but if it's available on all platforms, that's one
