While MLB said the investigation did not uncover evidence Hoberg personally bet on baseball or manipulated games, MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill recommended in May last year that Hoberg be fired. Commissioner Rob Manfred said Monday he upheld Hill\u2019s decision. Among the highest-rated umpires at judging the strike zone, Hoberg can apply for reinstatement no earlier than 2026 spring training.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/03/mlb-fires-umpire-pat-hoberg-over-shared-account-with-frie",

As a fan of the original Civilization, a complex turn-based strategy sim about building vast kingdoms through thousands of years of human history, I was keen to review the sequel and my editor let me. Reader, I became completely addicted. I played the game for two weeks non-stop, leaving many pages of the magazine unwritten. This earned me a very severe written warning. In short, Sid Meier\u2019s series almost ended my career in games writing \u2013 which is perhaps why I didn\u2019t review the following four instalments.

Simply chuck everything in there, turn it on and a few hours later dinner is effortlessly served. No fuss, just delicious meals.</p><p>But there are a few basic slow cooker rules that you need to abide by. First, the liquid: unlike the oven or hob, a slow cooker doesn\u2019t lose as much liquid through evaporation, so even if a dish looks as if it\u2019s not saucy enough, trust me, it very probably is, in which case adding a load of extra stock or water will just leave you with soup, which is ideal only if you\u2019re actually making soup.
