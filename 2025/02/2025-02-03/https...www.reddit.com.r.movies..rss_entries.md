<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The last time I saw Kelly&#39;s Heroes was about twenty years ago. I recently rewatched it and re-discovered what a fantastic movie it is.</p> <p>The all star cast is perfect. Clint Eastwood is amazing as Kelly, Telly Savalas as Big Joe, Don Rickles of course, and Donald Sutherland as Oddball steals every scene he&#39;s in. I LOVE Oddball. And Carroll O&#39;Conner as the general &quot;GET ME MY UNIFORM!&quot; </p> <p>There are so many goofy funny moments that are all taken seriously, Big Joe admonishing his men and telling them to buld a bar in the farmhouse, &quot;But we don&#39;t have no booze. We&#39;ll get some booze!&quot; the Captain driving off with a yacht after warning them about looting, Oddball&#39;s &quot;boys&quot; all lounging around while Kelly looks like he&#39;s trying not to laugh, &quot;Get out of here, the game&#39;s on!&quot; </p> <p>And the battles are really well done and realistic, and you could really relate to Kelly and his

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So me and my husband love to watch movies together, but he’s the kind of person who figures out the plot/plot twist before it actually happens. In every kind of movie whether it’s an action movie, a rom-com, a mystery. Everything. </p> <p>I need a movie that will genuinely stump him. Something so out of left- field he didn’t even see it coming. Nothing super scary though, we’re not horror film people. </p> <p>I can’t even begin to give a list of movies we have watched bc there are so many. But to give an instance of how wide across genres it goes: we watched “crazy, stupid love” the other night and he pretty much guessed some of the ending. We watched the first “Knives Out” last night. He guessed it too. Granted these may not be too hard to follow and predict, but he does it it nearly every movie.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HuntAny7768"> /u/HuntAny7768 </a> <br/> <

## Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd doesn't get the credit it deserves

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fair to say Tim Burton&#39;s career isn&#39;t what it once was. In the 90s and early noughties, he was one of the most powerful directors in Hollywood. The quality of his output began to take a gradual dive throughout the 2000s, sadly, and post 2010, his films seemed to become more child orientated.</p> <p>I feel like Sweeney Todd is one film that doesn&#39;t get the credit it deserves, however. It feels like the epitome of what Burton was building towards in his career. A deliciously grim gothic tale about famous Victorian serial killer. While also being a fun quirky musical.</p> <p>In 2007, Burton, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen were all arguably at the height of their fame. Absolutely stellar cast, with the likes of Timothy Spall as a bonus.</p> <p>The cinematography and the set design is best he ever had. Just looks glorious. Some spectacular shots and filmmaking techniques at work. It&#39;s got all

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Starman is everything I&#39;d want in a sci-fi romantic movie. This is the movie that made me understand what love is, the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen is incredible, you genuinely believe their bond, but at the same time, it&#39;s such a sad movie. </p> <p>What might seem a movie about an Alien. Starman/Scott (Jeff Bridges), taking human form and holding his female companion, Jenny (Allen) hostage for most of the film, ends up being a picture about an alien life form learning how it is to be a human while at the same time, a broken woman starts to accept the loss of her husband/partner, the alien having taken his appearance which adds greater gravitas. Jenny barely having survived the death of Scott, now faces another loss, Starman/Scott whom she learns to love and starts to yearn to leave Earth with him. All the time, they&#39;re being chased after by the Government. </p> <p>Crucial for the movie, it&#39;s Jack Nitzsche&#39;s epic

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was always fascinated by the effects of a nuclear war in Britain. I looked at old documentaries and informational films such as Protect and Survive when I was younger. I thought about how to protect myself and my family should the worse happen. I was thinking to myself that &quot;We could survive this with proper planning.&quot; </p> <p>I&#39;m not correct. The mortality rate of a nuclear war in the UK was estimated at 53% of the UK population, some 29 million people, according to Square Leg. Chances are, I wouldn&#39;t even be safe. I used to live near RAF Menwith Hill, a missile warning site, and one of the primary targets for a first strike. But I still believed that I would be one of the &quot;lucky ones&quot; and would survive the nuclear explosions and fallout. </p> <p>Last night, I watched the film Threads from 1984, which seriously made me reconsider my position.</p> <p>The film is split into three acts: the time before the bombs, the short

Any movie that fits that is welcome, but I&#39;m specifically looking for good examples in the mafia and yakuza genres. “Breaking Bad” would be an absolutely perfect example in the world of television.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stickbob123"> /u/stickbob123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1igcje4/climbing_the_ladder_of_organized_crime_film_recs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1igcje4/climbing_the_ladder_of_organized_crime_film_recs/">[comments]</a></span>
