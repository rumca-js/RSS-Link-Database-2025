<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>An evil-maid rootkit is a type of stealthy malware that is physically installed on a device, by an attacker with temporary access. The term comes from the idea that even a hotel maid—or any unauthorized person—could install it while the owner is away. This kind of rootkit is designed to compromise system security at a deep level, often targeting bootloaders, firmware, or encryption mechanisms to intercept passwords, decrypt sensitive data, or install backdoors for remote access.</p> <p>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/umutcamliyurt/Tails_or_Jails">https://github.com/umutcamliyurt/Tails_or_Jails</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/0TheNemesis0"> /u/0TheNemesis0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ignwod/an_evilmaid_rootkit_for_tails_os/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ignwod/an_evilmaid_rootkit_for_tails_os
