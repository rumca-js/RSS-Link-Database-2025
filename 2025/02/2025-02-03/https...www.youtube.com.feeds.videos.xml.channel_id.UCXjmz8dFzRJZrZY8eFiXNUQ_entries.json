        "description": "Since the debut of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker have mastered the art of satire across TV, film, and even Broadway. From South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut to The Book of Mormon, everything they touch seems to turn to gold. But when they decided to take on puppetry with Team America: World Police, their signature fast-paced production pipeline came to a screeching halt. The process behind Team America World Police was such a disaster that the film nearly didn\u2019t get finished. Despite the challenges, they pulled it off\u2014creating one of the biggest cult classics in comedy history.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Do you think Team America: World Police is one of the greatest satirical comedies ever made?
