Im kind of looking for a similar headset to the index to use with vive trackers that just has higher res displays and is base station tracked. Is the Pimax Crystal any good with the base station tracking face plate? Or are there significant drawbacks that make it not worth it? Most reviews I can find are at least 5-8 months old, and was wondering if the issues mentioned in those reviews have been resolved. I have a bigscreen beyond, but the lenses and fov leave a lot to be desired.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Autistic_GoofBall\"> /u/Autistic_GoofBall </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1igwijn/is_the_pimax_crystal_light_any_good_with_base/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1igwijn/is_the_pimax_crystal_light_any",

I just want a low budget video headset for my Android cell phone to see, what the camera sees, in order to film things from certain angles where I cannot easily position myself comfortably to see the display. Like that I could for example inspect the bottom of my car simply with a selfie stick, instead of laying down and crawling under the car. I am using a xiaomi 11t pro and the Samsung a35 5g. I am hoping to find a video headset, that works with one of those, in a low budget area around 100 euro or hopefully not more than 200.

The issue was the visual kept coming up which started to annoy me. </p> <p>- Every DIY hotfix was only temporary since updates reset it.</p> <p>- Unbareable lag for both light games and videos when it didn&#39;t work on a good system (RTX 3070, Ryzen 5800x, 4x8 GB Ram 3600mhz, Samsung Evo 970)</p> <p>- Video quality not its best.

Would i see any benefits in VR? I&#39;m pretty sure i would get more frames on flatscreen as i use a 2560x1080p monitor, but would i notice anything in PCVR? Using a quest3 with 6ghz wifi via VirtualDesktop.</p> <p>I&#39;m more than satisfied how games run in flat screen, but not rly in VR side. So if that would make no visible upgrade i might go for the GPU first, since cpu isnt that important for VR.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gazop\"> /u/Gazop </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/co",

I read everyone hyping it up to be one of the best vr games but playing the first area (the lab facilities) was kind of boring. Once you leave and start traveling to new areas it really gets fun. Especially the later half. I went from kind of hating on it a little to really loving it. The gameplay was fun the whole way through just the environment was bland at first. Cant wait for the dlc and im also going to play the remaster of the first one. </p> <p>Did anyone else feel that the game has a slow start? The variety in weapons is really fun. I like traveling to all the different places. It\u2019s a charming game!

So when I use VR on my quest 3 to connect to my notebook it should be also possible that steam VR is just working. Also UEVR should easily be possible on the GeforceNow system if it is allowed to install it there. </p> <p>Why is VR and I mean really VR not supported on GeforceNow?
