The podcast takes you behind the scenes of our organisation \u2013 and lets you listen to our ideas taking form.\n\nWe long for love to last forever, and yet experience shows us that it seems often and perhaps always to end. John and Alain ask why love can die and resist the thought that it must, arriving at a host of suggestion for how we can protect our loves from the corrosive effects of ingratitude and neglect.\n\nTo hear full episodes, subscribe to The School of Life app today.\n\nhttps://www.theschooloflife.com/subscription/",

The podcast takes you behind the scenes of our organisation \u2013 and lets you listen to our ideas taking form.\n \nIn this episode, Alain and John explore our longings for friendship and the painful sense that we frequently don\u2019t quite have the friends we would like - and can\u2019t easily access the sort of topics that can unlock true sincerity and interest. Alain and John, friends themselves, share both their loneliness and their insights into what what can help to build fulfilling connections.\n\nTo hear full episodes, subscribe to The School of Life app today.\n\nhttps://www.theschooloflife.com/subscription/",

They explore why we\u2019re so resistant to attempts to \u2018correct\u2019 our behaviour, the role of humour in teaching, and why getting someone to change might be as difficult as climbing K2 in one\u2019s slippers\u2026\n\nTo hear full episodes, subscribe to The School of Life app today.\n\nhttps://www.theschooloflife.com/subscription/",
