A new study published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics reveals a potential discrepancy in the expected clumpiness of cosmic structures. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analysed data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Their findings suggest a lower-than-expected density fluctuation (σ8), raising questions about cosmic evolution. While not yet statistically significant, the anomaly could point to new physics. Future observations, including those from the Simons Observatory, will refine these insights.

Chinese astronauts aboard the Tiangong space station have made a significant breakthrough by successfully producing oxygen and rocket fuel through artificial photosynthesis. Using carbon dioxide and water, the process mimics the natural photosynthesis found in plants, with the potential to produce methane or formic acid with minor adjustments. Unlike electrolysis, which consumes a large portion of the International Space Station’s power, this technique is energy-efficient and could be vital for China’s plans to establish a lunar base by 2035. This innovation supports long-term space missions, reducing dependence on Earth for supplies.
