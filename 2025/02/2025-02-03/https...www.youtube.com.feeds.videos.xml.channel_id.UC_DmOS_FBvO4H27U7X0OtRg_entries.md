Ever tried Interviewing a Voodoo Spirit? It wasn't easy. Voodoo is a deeply rooted spiritual tradition in Benin, recognized as an official religion. Originating in West Africa, it involves the worship of spirits and ancestors, rituals, drumming, and trance ceremonies. Voodoo plays a central role in West African culture, influencing art, music, and daily life. In this video we were assaulted by a spirit, and then we fell down a rabbit hole of beatings, alcohol, and sacrifice. Anyway, enjoy the adventure!
