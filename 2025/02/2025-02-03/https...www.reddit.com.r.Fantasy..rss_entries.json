I was thinking about something like Avatar the last Airbender, with a similar elementar magic system and with a found family. And yes I\u2019ve read the Avatar novels, but I was thinking of a more adult version.

I\u2019m specifically looking for something similar to The Roots of Chaos series, since I enjoyed it so much and I really like the worldbuilding and the medium/slow pace of the whole story, where we get to see the characters in their day to day lives and the politics of the world. I know a bunch of classic Adult High Fantasy books that match those requirements, but they don\u2019t have a main sapphic romance (or any at all). I don\u2019t need the romance to be the main focus as long as it has some focus, I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s standalone or a series, but please only High Fantasy! I know we have some amazing books that are also Sci-Fi (like TLT series) and urban fantasy, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for. Also it should be adult, I have nothing against YA but I\u2019d like more complexity to the plot.</p> <p>For reference I\u2019ve already read Gideon the Ninth and Baru Cormorant (loved both but I\u2019d say they are not proper fantasy boo",

Being a fantasy/sci fi reader, I ended up on this sub Reddit. Every time I have posed a question or made a comment, people have responded with respect and been so helpful. There have been a couple times I have misquoted or confused authors and folks just gently redirected rather than trying to make me feel stupid. I don\u2019t hang out on Reddit a ton, but I can tell you from what I have seen that this is not the case in other communities I have seen. In fact, this is one of the only places I feel comfortable posting, or interacting with posts at all.

But when it comes to science fiction, we have Dune, which is a towering giant, yet it doesn\u2019t seem to hold the same monopoly over the genre.

Is it because fantasy leans more heavily on mythology and classic adventure structures that Tolkien refined? Or is it because science fiction, by its nature, is more diverse in its expressions and themes?</p> <p>What do you think? Do you also feel like there\u2019s a \u201cTolkien shadow\u201d over fantasy, while sci-fi gets to be more experimental?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been into fantasy for a long time now but recently they all read very, very similarly. All the new \u2018romantasy\u2019 books feature identical headstrong protagonists with romance stories that are almost always enemies to lovers. When A Court of Thorns and Roses came out, I really loved it but I do think that Sarah J. Maas has become so incredibly popular that every romantic interest reads as a carbon copy of Rhysand and every protagonist a copy of Aelin. As a result I feel like I have to search in the epic/dark fantasy section as a way to completely escape the romantasy feel. Is it just me that feels this way? Let me know any recommendations you have please I need help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/reservoir_phrog\"> /u/reservoir_phrog </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igccnm/need_fresh_fantasy_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

(I know its probably not for quite a while, but something more specific than &#39;the end of the year&#39; would be appreciated) I have missed every single one so far despite being in this sub for years. I always see it like a week or 2 later when the polling is already closed. I really don&#39;t want to miss the next one!</p> <p>Also, a note for everyone who puts the poll together - would be cool to leave the voting open for longer so that there is a higher chance of more people being able to vote!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Any-Syllabub8168\"> /u/Any-Syllabub8168 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igbpkr/top_fantasy_novels_polls/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igbpkr/top_fantasy_novels_polls/\">[comments]</a></span>",
