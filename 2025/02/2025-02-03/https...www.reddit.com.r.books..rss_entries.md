<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading Murder in Vienna by E.C. R. Lorac (published 1956), specifically the British Library Crime Classics paperback reprint (2024). At the beginning there&#39;s a standard boilerplate about how stereotypes and attitudes expressed in the book may not match publishing standards today etc. </p> <p>However, it ends by saying, &quot;therefore, the following novel is presented as it was originally published with two edits to the text and minor edits made for consistency of style and sense.&quot; </p> <p>The consistency of style and sense part I get. I&#39;ve done a bit of vintage manuscript editing myself and the majority of the work was in the vein of adding and removing commas. (BTW I&#39;m not too impressed with the proofreading in this book collection; I&#39;ve noticed several typos. But that&#39;s neither here not there lol)</p> <p>It&#39;s the &quot;two edits to the text&quot; piece that&#39;s throwing my curiosity into overdrive. If they h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I went into this knowing it wasn’t the most popular sequel. I don’t really like going into books with pre conceived notions. I was pleasantly at how much I enjoyed it despite being a much slower pace than Annihilation. I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is the fact that I love the inexplicable aspects of these stories. </p> <p>The southern reaches mismanagement of Area X and Centrals real lack of caring about the issue is apparent in the southern reach HQ. It’s run down, clearly funds have been reallocated and mismanaged into things that are of larger concern to the government. Area X is an anomaly that has no clear motive, can’t be reasoned or negotiated with and is beyond our understanding, it “cleanses” areas and completely changes them. Through this mismanagement or some greater force at play the borders of Area X begin to grow out of the little bit of control they had over it. </p> <p>My interpretation of this is that it represents our gove

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There definitely will be some spoilers in this, so read with caution. I really enjoyed this short but impactful novel. However, I am trying to connect the message behind the trial &amp; affair. There was so much focus on the affair that I felt like I was missing the bigger picture. Was it all to spark conversation on people and the choices they make and why they do something? I would love to see what others thought or how they interpreted the novel as a whole. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lit_junkie"> /u/lit_junkie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1igvekz/i_just_finished_the_body_in_question_by_jill/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1igvekz/i_just_finished_the_body_in_question_by_jill/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Before I delve into spoilers, I highly recommend Heaven as the perfect entrypoint into Mieko Kawakami&#39;s novels. It&#39;s short, sweet and perfectly captures the bittersweet humanity so potent in her stories.</p> <p><strong>Bullying is bad (duh)</strong></p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a &quot;hot take,&quot; but I genuinely adore Heaven as a story about overcoming trauma and abuse. I&#39;ve read so much praise about how &quot;bleak&quot; and &quot;oppressive&quot; the book feels, but I think those aren&#39;t even the book&#39;s strongest points The story even goes out of its way to showcase how pointless most bullying actually is.</p> <p>Ninomiya, the main bully, does it purely to power trip. The book makes a point of having Ninomiya do these things in full view of the class, or his gang. Despite his &quot;ace&quot; status, he constantly needs validation from his peers to feel powerful. Meanwhile, his second, Momose, is a nihilistic edgelord t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is actually a companion book to a novel I read earlier this year called Isaac&#39;s Song. In that one, a young man named Isaac pens a series of personal diaries about growing up gay under his abusive father Jacob. DCFM is the reverse, with Jacob writing a series of letters to Isaac on his deathbed telling his life story from losing his brother as a child in rural Arkansas to married life in Kansas City and living alone after seperating from his wife. As you&#39;d expect it&#39;s really sad to read. Jacob is well aware of how badly he&#39;s driven away everyone who loved him and as much as he wants to reconnect with his son, is too afraid of what might happen to actually reach out. Jacob is not a good person, he flat out admits it but he also tried really hard in his later years to be better and explain why he treated Isaac the way he did and whether or not he deserves forgiveness or even peace of mind is something left up to the reader in both n

I do agree that the book does bring up some amazing questions such as what makes us human and sequences that just made me blow my mind (the toad and the fake police station). </p> <p>Or was it just a simple story of a man who was able to rekindle his failing relationship with his wife through emotionally traumatic events? I tried to see what he was saying about religion through Mercerism but I was just dumbstruck, especially that Oregon sequence.

When I saw the cover in my YA Lit class syllabus (I&#39;m 27 and NOT one to hate a book just because it&#39;s required reading; for example, I hate poetry but the first novel we read in this class was in verse and I adored it) and read the prologue, I thought it was going to be AWESOME...</p> <p>And then I continued reading. Oh my gosh, what a concept wasted on poor, boring execution. It could have been INCREDIBLE, but even I, a person who tends to enjoy being told rather than shown because the brain doesn&#39;t have to piece things together (I&#39;m a tired college student okay?xD), quickly got tired of the info dumps.
