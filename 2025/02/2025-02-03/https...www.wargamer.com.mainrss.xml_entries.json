Sure, having a plus one version of your weapon, or an amulet that grants crucial damage resistances, could be essential to surviving a perilous quest - but will it make you smile? Will it, even for a moment, lighten the crushing weight of our existence on this pale blue dot? Maybe - I\u2019m not the boss of you - but I hope these stupid joke items have a better chance of raising chuckles around your table.</p>\n \t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tContinue reading <a href=\"https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/u",
