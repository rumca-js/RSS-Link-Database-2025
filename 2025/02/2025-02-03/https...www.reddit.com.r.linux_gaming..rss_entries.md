<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello reddit, I have been running Arch on my computer for about a year now. And I have most definitely been loving it. That being said I do have some programs and games that I miss. Obviously not enough to drop Linux though, so i would like to dual-boot. Thus, I bought a second drive (I do not want windows to ever touch Linux) to install it. I&#39;m not sure how relevent this is, but my motherboard is a &quot;X670E AORUS PRO X.&quot;</p> <p>Now that the context is out of the way I can move on to the actual question. Should I go with Windows 11 because 10 is nearing end of life? Do I need to do anything special with partitions and mounting or can I just install the drive? Will I be able to boot into windows with grub? Is their any other stuff I need to know that I might miss? </p> <p>Thank you for your patience and for taking the time to read this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hanged-Fool"> /u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok so basically I mainly play on a Steam Deck, specifically with the “switch to desktop” feature. I play Minecraft PvP in which I use a technic called “Double-Click”, in which the debounce time of the mouse is very low and this allows one click to register as two. So, I need to know how to change the debounce time, since the mouse software can’t be installed on linux, and I basically don’t know nothing about linux! I searched something up and maybe I found the solution with libinput on this post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/s/2CC1WSxDHN">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/s/2CC1WSxDHN</a><br/> But I don’t understand how do I do the commands on the terminal!
