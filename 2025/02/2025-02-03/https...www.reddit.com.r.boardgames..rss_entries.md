## A Netflix movie based on The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last year, Netflix released a movie based on The Werewolves of Miller&#39;s Hollow. They don&#39;t advertise it as such for the English-speaking market, because the English title is Family Pack. But the original French title is Loups-Garous (Werewolves), and it is clearly licensed from The Werewolves of Miller&#39;s Hollow – it uses the artwork from the board game cover and all.</p> <p>The movie is… well, pretty awful. It&#39;s a family movie and the creators clearly have no idea what makes The Werewolves interesting, so they just poorly rip off Jumanji. I did chuckle a handful of times, though, so at least there&#39;s that.</p> <p>So I don&#39;t recommend it as a good movie at all, but if you want to see the newest board game adaptation, you can check it out (especially if you have kids). And I thought it&#39;d be a fun fact for folks here to know.</p> <p>BTW: I kept trying to also add the movie poster to the post, but for some reason the bot keeps

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday I played the Total War Rome board game plus some expansion/additional content (I know it added tactics cards, unsure if anything else came from it), and there were a lot of rules questions that we couldn&#39;t easily figure out, including some rules that we probably misunderstood because they seemed like really poor design choices if we were playing them correctly. So I&#39;m hoping someone here might know the answers to these questions.</p> <p>(*) How do you determine what gets hit in combat when a stack of units is attacked? I know smirmishers need to hit skirmishers if possible, and wounds prioritize already wounded units, but outside of those specific scenarios who/what decides what gets hit? Also, how does this work for skirmishers given that they only exist for the first round? Can they absorb hits that MCUs would otherwise take from non-skirmisher units? </p> <p>(<em>) We had a *lot</em> of questions about unit placement in combat, a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I thought I’d share some recent thoughts on Wingspan, curious if others feel similarly..</p> <p>I bought Wingspan early on in my board gaming journey, and at first, I really enjoyed it. It was great for two-players, the artwork is stunning, the engine-building mechanics are satisfying, and it has a relaxing, welcoming feel that made it easy to introduce to new players. But after 15 months and a lot more experience with different games, I’ve realized I don’t enjoy Wingspan as much as I once did.</p> <p>Last night, we had some friends over who are newer to board games, and they wanted to learn Wingspan. Since we hadn’t played in ages, we figured, “Why not? Let’s dust it off.” Teaching naturally slowed things down a bit, but overall, they really enjoyed learning and playing the game (and I don’t think that was just lip service). That said, I was struck by how much downtime there was at four players and, more than that, how little player interact

The strategy and bluffing mechanics surprised me, and each game plays out so differently that it never feels stale.

I don&#39;t remember much information about the game, but here&#39;s what I have:</p> <p>It&#39;s a small box, not big/expensive;</p> <p>Probably Asian or Japanese themed, I can&#39;t say the theme was Samurai/Ninja for sure, but it was something similar;</p> <p>I think your goal was to fight other clans;</p> <p>The game had a unique art style, I think it was similar to “Tatsu”;</p> <p>You could probably play it alone or with someone else (not sure about this one);</p> <p>Clean box art (probably some kind of landscape?).</p> <p>That&#39;s all I could remember, sorry if it didn&#39;t help much, I&#39;ve been looking for this game for 3 days already^^&#39;</p> </div><!--

So I wanted to post here so that maybe other people could help share in the excitement. I am trying to make the game through the site thegamecrafter.com.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Played some games of <strong>Voidfall</strong> and something I think should be appreciated is how Agenda cards (basically contracts) not only give you victory points when fulfilled, but also give you an extra action on the turn they&#39;re played. This is a big deal in a game where you normally have 2 actions per turn (3 if you spend a trade token) and it&#39;s very satisfying when you can effectively combine that extra action with your normal actions.</p> <p>Another game I love is <strong>Nucleum</strong> and it&#39;s great when you unlock technologies that give you extra benefits when taking an action, or really just the fact that you can purchase improved actions that make later turns much more powerful than the early ones.</p> <p>What other heavy euros are based on getting more powerful actions and/or chaining those actions in better ways?
