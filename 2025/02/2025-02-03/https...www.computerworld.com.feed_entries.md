<p>US President Donald J. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese-made computing equipment are slated to go into effect tonight — but at a much lower rate than he initially threatened.</p>



<p>The 10% tariff will do much less damage than the 100% version that had been touted — and there are other factors that will mitigate its impact on enterprise IT budgets.</p>



<p>Ranjit Atwal , Gartner senior director analyst, has been modelling the likely evolution of PC prices this year. Even without the tariffs, he was forecasting average PC prices would rise by around 4% because of inflation and a move to AI PCs; those models typically include more expensive processors with neural processing units (NPUs) and a mini

<p>As part of Microsoft’s big push into AI services, the company has created a new department called the Advanced Planning Unit (APU). Employees of the APU will, among other things, study the effects of AI on society and make recommendations about which products are worth investing resources in.</p>

<p>Apple’s iPhone business isn’t just about new product sales. The second-user and services markets need to be considered, too. Not only does the company command the first market, but it continues to generate healthy services-related revenue on every iPhone used — an estimated $72 per user, per year, according to Morgan Stanley.</p>



<p>There’s little doubt the revenue generated by these services can help the company navigate challenging economic times, and it doesn’t matter if the device itself is first- or second-hand, so long as users sign up for services. </p>
