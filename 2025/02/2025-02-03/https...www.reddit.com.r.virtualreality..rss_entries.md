<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought my Quest 3 about three weeks ago. I noticed yesterday that the left thumbstick was making clicky noises when I simply tapping/touching it (without actually moving it). Did some research online and apparently this defect is prevalent. Since I now became aware of the issue I tried to listen to my right thumbstick...it&#39;s there, but a lot less audible. Like I really just hear it if I focus on it and it&#39;s closer to my ear vs the left which is a lot louder</p> <p>I reached out to Meta and they agreed to replace both controllers with possibly refurbished controllers.</p> <p>Besides the fact that it&#39;s disappointing to get a refurbished for something just a few weeks old within the return window, I was wondering if controllers with no clicks noises exist at all (how rare?). Or do all of them have but some are just louder than others? I&#39;m not sure if I should replace the right controller since I truly wouldn&#39;t have known if it wasn

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am not sure, whether this is the right subreddit to ask, because what I need is not really about virtual reality. I just want a low budget video headset for my Android cell phone to see, what the camera sees, in order to film things from certain angles where I cannot easily position myself comfortably to see the display. Like that I could for example inspect the bottom of my car simply with a selfie stick, instead of laying down and crawling under the car. I am using a xiaomi 11t pro and the Samsung a35 5g. I am hoping to find a video headset, that works with one of those, in a low budget area around 100 euro or hopefully not more than 200.

To list them:</p> <p>- Wouldn&#39;t connect to PC properly. (Including a stupid expensive first party USB lead)</p> <p>- The interface is hell to navigate, with things being hidden that shouldn&#39;t be.</p> <p>- Boundary space was an issue since I&#39;m in a smaller than usual space, but not doing anything like beatsaber. The issue was the visual kept coming up which started to annoy me. </p> <p>- Every DIY hotfix was only temporary since updates reset it.</p> <p>- Unbareable lag for both light games and videos when it didn&#39;t work on a good system (RTX 3070, Ryzen 5800x, 4x8 GB Ram 3600mhz, Samsung Evo 970)</p> <p>- Video quality not its best.

Would i see any benefits in VR? I&#39;m pretty sure i would get more frames on flatscreen as i use a 2560x1080p monitor, but would i notice anything in PCVR? Using a quest3 with 6ghz wifi via VirtualDesktop.</p> <p>I&#39;m more than satisfied how games run in flat screen, but not rly in VR side. So if that would make no visible upgrade i might go for the GPU first, since cpu isnt that important for VR.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gazop"> /u/Gazop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just beat vertigo 2 today. I read everyone hyping it up to be one of the best vr games but playing the first area (the lab facilities) was kind of boring. Once you leave and start traveling to new areas it really gets fun. Especially the later half. I went from kind of hating on it a little to really loving it. The gameplay was fun the whole way through just the environment was bland at first. Cant wait for the dlc and im also going to play the remaster of the first one. </p> <p>Did anyone else feel that the game has a slow start? The variety in weapons is really fun. I like traveling to all the different places. It’s a charming game! Would definitely recommend.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/julz0666"> /u/julz0666 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1igj1qz/vertigo_2_gets_way_better_after_the_first_2_hours/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I wanted to try out GeForce Now today, but all three offers are sold out. Put me on waiting list and see when I can book it. </p> <p>Of course I hope lags are okay and then I might play any game on my humble Lenovo Notebook in super quality. This is something I consider 20 Euros per month are okay.</p> <p>But I want more. I understand that VR is not yet possible, so I will get a 2D screen in front of my face what makes no sense for me. But why is this so? As far as I understood GeforceNow supports steam and also steam VR. So when I use VR on my quest 3 to connect to my notebook it should be also possible that steam VR is just working. Also UEVR should easily be possible on the GeforceNow system if it is allowed to install it there. </p> <p>Why is VR and I mean really VR not supported on GeforceNow? Are there some technical limitations that I overlooked or do they just dont care?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://ww
