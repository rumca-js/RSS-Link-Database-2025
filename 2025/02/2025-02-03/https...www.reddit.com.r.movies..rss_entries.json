In every kind of movie whether it\u2019s an action movie, a rom-com, a mystery. Everything. </p> <p>I need a movie that will genuinely stump him. Something so out of left- field he didn\u2019t even see it coming. Nothing super scary though, we\u2019re not horror film people. </p> <p>I can\u2019t even begin to give a list of movies we have watched bc there are so many. But to give an instance of how wide across genres it goes: we watched \u201ccrazy, stupid love\u201d the other night and he pretty much guessed some of the ending. We watched the first \u201cKnives Out\u201d last night. He guessed it too. Granted these may not be too hard to follow and predict, but he does it it nearly every movie.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HuntAny7768\"> /u/HuntAny7768 </a> <br/> <",

In the 90s and early noughties, he was one of the most powerful directors in Hollywood. The quality of his output began to take a gradual dive throughout the 2000s, sadly, and post 2010, his films seemed to become more child orientated.</p> <p>I feel like Sweeney Todd is one film that doesn&#39;t get the credit it deserves, however. It feels like the epitome of what Burton was building towards in his career. A deliciously grim gothic tale about famous Victorian serial killer. While also being a fun quirky musical.</p> <p>In 2007, Burton, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen were all arguably at the height of their fame. Absolutely stellar cast, with the likes of Timothy Spall as a bonus.</p> <p>The cinematography and the set design is best he ever had. Just looks glorious.

This is the movie that made me understand what love is, the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen is incredible, you genuinely believe their bond, but at the same time, it&#39;s such a sad movie. </p> <p>What might seem a movie about an Alien. Starman/Scott (Jeff Bridges), taking human form and holding his female companion, Jenny (Allen) hostage for most of the film, ends up being a picture about an alien life form learning how it is to be a human while at the same time, a broken woman starts to accept the loss of her husband/partner, the alien having taken his appearance which adds greater gravitas. Jenny barely having survived the death of Scott, now faces another loss, Starman/Scott whom she learns to love and starts to yearn to leave Earth with him. All the time, they&#39;re being chased after by the Government. </p> <p>Crucial for the movie, it&#39;s Jack Nitzsche&#39;s epic",
