<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My AmiKit installation is stuck on trying to install Opus 5. A progress bar is shown in Amikit and workbench freezes. If I do a reboot, I get a black screen with red &quot;software failure&quot; It then boots to workbench 3.2. I reboot, select AK0 in boot menu, and it goes to same screen stuck with opus 5 progress bar.</p> <p>This issue started after first instalation when i disabled the partition with opus 5 files by mistake and amikit could not install this and halted.</p> <p>Is there anyway to restart the amikit instalation to get out of this loop? I have downloaded old backup to Amikit SD card but no change. I&#39;m able to enter Amikit OS by booting in safe mode but not sure where to change to get out of this loop. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AmigaSanctum"> /u/AmigaSanctum </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1igh0ao/problem_installing_amikit_on_a1200_pistor
