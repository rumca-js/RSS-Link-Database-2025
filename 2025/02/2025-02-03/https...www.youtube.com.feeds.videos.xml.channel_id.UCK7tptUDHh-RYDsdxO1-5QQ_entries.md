President Trump’s aggressive move to place tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China could trigger a trade war. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum negotiated with Trump at the last minute, putting tariffs on Mexico on hold for a month. Meanwhile, Trudeau and Canada are planning on responding to the U.S. trade action with 25% tariffs of their own on specific products like lumber, household appliances and fruit. 

WSJ’s economics reporter Jeanne Whalen explains how the tariffs can drive up prices for consumers.

The New Orleans Superdome is set to host Super Bowl LIX between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. The stadium’s latest $560M renovation–from the concession stands to the seating bowl–helped save it from demolition after Hurricane Katrina. NFL games have increasingly become more expensive with the addition of amenities like luxury field suites and club lounges, but all of these redesigns are done in order to increase revenue and efficiency.

WSJ spoke with the architect behind the Superdome’s plan, who explains how stadium design is evolving to create more revenue streams.
