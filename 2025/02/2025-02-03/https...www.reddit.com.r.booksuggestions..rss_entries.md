<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read a really good book a few years ago but I do not remember the name of it. It was about this poor farming family in a tyrant kingdom where the dad worked under the evil king as a dragon knight where he would ride dragons into battle. The dad got tired of the king and tried to assassinate him but failed and died in the process. Since the dad died the son went to jail for his father’s crimes and the king burnt down their farm causing the daughter (Main Character) to flee I to the mountains. While she was in the mountains with his he guards chasing her she finds a fox that leads her to a hiding place where she escapes the guards. At the top of the mountain was an elder dragon that the girl ended up taming and trained to be a dragon knight in secrecy. I believe she then goes on to attack the king with her dragon and frees her brother but I cannot remember that far into the story. If anyone has any clue of what I am talking about and know the name of

I was holding onto just about anyone, regardless of the quality of the relationship, simply because I thought having them in my life was better than having no one.</p> <p>So for 2025, I want to commit myself to learning how to be more comfortable being by myself, especially in public.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mother-Weakness6743"> /u/Mother-Weakness6743 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ih1198/self_help_books_for_someone_learning_how_to_be/">[link]</a></span> &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Reddit to the rescue!</p> <p>English teacher from Germany here... I am currently looking for short stories/poems to read with my 9th grade EFL students as part of a unit on how gendered parenting can create a glass ceiling that limits what girls and boys believe about what life has in store for them.</p> <p>I had already been considering something of the likes of Jamaica Kincaid&#39;s <em>Girl</em> as it is quite short and sums up societal expectations towards teenage girls quite well*.* However, it is quite old and might be a little too challenging for learners of a foreign language.</p> <p>Do you have any ideas of short stories/poems that touch upon this subject? Maybe there is a story involving a brother and sister who are raised differently which would offer an opportunity for identification for my male students as well?</p> <p>I&#39;d be happy about any suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.co

I used to love reading but idk how to find a different genre that provides me with that feeling where I can’t put it down, or I stay up way too late reading it. I read about 35-40 books a year, mostly for work research or developmental purposes Even in my free time, Ive found Im typically only drawn to self help/psychology/ self analysis books, plus it’s what my bookshelf consists of. It’s habit at this point and I do love psycho analysis. Sometimes it feels like if I have the time to read, I should optimize it for work. And I just don’t know what I like anymore outside of it. Sometimes I just want a book that doesn’t make me think so much, or can provide an escape. I can’t even remember the last time I read a book for fun that I loved. I think I would prefer a series. I liked them a lot when I was younger. I don’t like anything fantasy or sci fi so please no suggestions
