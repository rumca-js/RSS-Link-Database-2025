<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Direct sequels in games are funny things, aren't they? As narrative contrivances go for honouring all the choices you made and characters you built in the first part of the story, there are usually two schools of thought on how to keep building on that foundation effectively. One is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> route, where developers rummage even deeper into their bag of tricks and somehow emerge with even wilder skills and abilities that make the first game's power curve look like training wheels.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Read more</a></p>

## Civilization 7 review

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/civilization_vii_review_1-(1).jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Civilization 7 is by no means a bad game. I open with that to acknowledge its competence, and to damn it. Civ is the archetypal 4X, and in some senses, Civ 7 remains a standard-bearer. It's better, in a general sort of way, than most recent attempts to unseat or deconstruct it. There's lots going on, production values are high, and it innovates with a new structure and revamped diplomacy, city expansion, and more.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Read more</a></p>
