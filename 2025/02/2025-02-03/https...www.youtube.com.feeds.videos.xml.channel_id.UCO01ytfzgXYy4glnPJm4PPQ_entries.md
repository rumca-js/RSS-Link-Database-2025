Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the DNC met over the weekend to elect their new leadership. It was an unintentionally hilarious circus that proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the Democrats learned nothing from their embarrassing defeat. Also, Trump's tariffs on Mexico are already getting results. Trump now has his eyes set on Panama. He says America should control it. He's absolutely rightâ€”I'll explain why. And a liberal philosophy writer humiliates himself in an attempt to debunk JD Vance.
