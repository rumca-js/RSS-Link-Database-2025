Our FIRST reality competition series AND NOW ITS ONE BIG FREAKING VIDEO! Luke and Linus go head 2 head to build the ultimate gaming PC for $300 bucks in 48 hours, meaning they gotta be cheap with all their components, like GPU and CPU. Find the deals to claim the crown. But things never go as expected, do they? It's hard to remember when we shot this like 10 years ago… so retro.
