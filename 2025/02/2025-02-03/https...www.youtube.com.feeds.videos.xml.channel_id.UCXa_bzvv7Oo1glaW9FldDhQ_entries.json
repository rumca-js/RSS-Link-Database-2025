        "description": "The Kingdom Come: Deliverance series continues after 7 years with the long-awaited sequel to Henry\u2019s inaugural adventure in medieval Bohemia. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is an outstanding open-world RPG bursting at the seams with compelling content. The main quest alone takes 60 hours or so, while side content easily reaches into the hundred-hour range.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just quantity that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 delivers. The main quest in particular is lovingly crafted in every respect. The cinematography is great, and the plot and characters are a roller-coaster of a ride to follow.\n\nSome of the old gremlins from the first game return - yes, I\u2019m referring to the Savior Schnapps save consumable. It\u2019s unfortunate that there\u2019s still no way to save anywhere at any time, and what makes it worse is the long loading time. Despite some hiccups here and there with the sim-adjacent systems at play, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is one of the better open-world games out there.",

        "description": "With Forza Horizon 5 finally coming to PS5 this Spring - and allegedly for Nintendo Switch 2 at an unknown date - the stage is seemingly set for other high-profile exclusives to follow. Rumors abound of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Starfield, Fable, and more coming to the platform.\n\nIt almost felt like yesterday that Microsoft presented itself as a competitor in the so-called console war, especially with hits like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. However, this is seemingly the result of last year's initiative, coupled with the company expanding the Xbox brand to other devices.\n\nThe situation is similar to post-Dreamcast era Sega, though Microsoft hasn't completely shut the door on Xbox consoles either. As bizarre as it may seem to have a console manufacturer also serve as a third-party publisher, the approach may benefit gamers across all platforms.",
