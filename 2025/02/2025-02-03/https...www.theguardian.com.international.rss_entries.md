While MLB said the investigation did not uncover evidence Hoberg personally bet on baseball or manipulated games, MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill recommended in May last year that Hoberg be fired. Commissioner Rob Manfred said Monday he upheld Hill’s decision. Among the highest-rated umpires at judging the strike zone, Hoberg can apply for reinstatement no earlier than 2026 spring training.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/03/mlb-fires-umpire-pat-hoberg-over-shared-account-with-frie

<p>Graham Potter knows nothing but disappointment at Stamford Bridge. Back at the club who sacked him after less than seven painful months in charge, Potter endured the frustration of Chelsea denying his new team with two scrappy goals in an angry second half. West Ham, who played well and nudged themselves in front when Jarrod Bowen punished an error from Levi Colwill, merely had the meagre consolation of knowing that they had given wealthier rivals a scare.</p><p>This was not convincing from Chelsea, even if they rose into the top four thanks to an equaliser from the excellent Pedro Neto and a Cole Palmer-inspired own goal from Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Enzo Maresca’s side were pallid for long spells and irritation was rising before an injury-hit West Ham ran out of steam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/03/chelsea-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Let the slow cooker do all the work while you’re out, and have a meal ready for when you get home</p><p><strong>I was given a slow cooker for Christmas, but haven’t used it yet – any advice for a complete novice?<br></strong>Slow cookers aren’t exactly sexy, but what they lack in aesthetics, they more than make up for in meal prepping and problem-solving. Simply chuck everything in there, turn it on and a few hours later dinner is effortlessly served. No fuss, just delicious meals.</p><p>But there are a few basic slow cooker rules that you need to abide by. First, the liquid: unlike the oven or hob, a slow cooker doesn’t lose as much liquid through evaporation, so even if a dish looks as if it’s not saucy enough, trust me, it very probably is, in which case adding a load of extra stock or water will just leave you with soup, which is ideal only if you’re actually making soup.

<p>She worried about her drinking, smoking and weight – but there was never any doubt she would have a job and be able to pay her rent. It’s a very different world for gen Z</p><p>It is 29 years since the book Bridget Jones’s Diary was published, but the column itself, which ran in the Independent (without a byline for Helen Fielding, although everyone knew it was her) and the Daily Telegraph, is 30 years old this year. That’s two years younger than our heroine when she first appears, a patchwork wreck of singleton-anxiety, professional disaster, chardonnay, Silk Cut and weighing scales. And maybe being old enough to remember with clarity anything from 30 years ago predisposes you to think of it affectionately. But, actually, no: some things were better for women, better for young people, better for everyone, in 1995. And some things were worse. To coincide with the fourth film, out on Valentine’s Day, here’s the audit.</p><p>The startling thing about the comic creation was how compl

<p>With the new Trump era likely to pose unprecedented challenges the message from Europe’s fragile democracies is: stay united and safeguard your institutions</p><p>Europeans who witnessed democracy crumble before their eyes have some words of advice for Americans now entering the second Trump era and worrying about the durability of their rights and freedoms: stay united, safeguard your civic institutions and never, never give up.</p><p>Citizens of central and eastern Europe are long accustomed to receiving counsel from a multitude of well-meaning US organisations on how to protect their fragile democracies following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now, after just 10 days of Donald Trump’s executive orders and civil service purges, the advice is beginning to flow the other way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/03/europeans-democracy-advice-trump-americans">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest in our series of writers choosing their favourite comfort movies is the charmingly filthy John Waters classic</p><p>It may seem like a stretch to call a film that features scenes of rape, murder, incest, castration, cannibalism, bestiality and, most famously, shit-eating, a “feel good” movie, but I can’t think of a film more worthy of the title than Pink Flamingos. To me, it’s like Singin’ in the Rain, but with scat, a thing of pure beauty and joy disguised as the most disgusting thing ever filmed.</p><p>The will to create a movie for the specific purpose of appalling anyone unaware of its true meaning turned Pink Flamingos into the ultimate litmus test. You either got its sick jokes or you didn’t. But those who did got something far more lasting than a laugh. We got a one-way ticket to an underground populated by parallel dissidents, an entire community of the unruly and free. That’s a <em>lot</em> to gain, which is why, even decades after I first saw Pink Flamingos, I

<p>Working long days as a corporate lawyer, I needed an exercise regime to get me out of my head. Reviving a childhood passion helped me reconnect with my body</p><p>My earliest memories of ballet will be familiar to many childhood dancers: ribbons, shoe fittings, hairspray (lots of it). I attended my first class at about four years old and continued off and on until my early teens, when I started to focus on other activities and on studying for exams. Since I&nbsp;was never planning to become a professional dancer, I didn’t consider that ballet would become an&nbsp;important part of <a href="http://www.eloiseskinner.com/">my adult life</a>. But today, at 32, it is one of my most meaningful passions – and I am so&nbsp;grateful to have rediscovered it.</p><p>That happened in my early 20s, when I was a corporate lawyer in London.

<p>The non-linear structure of Munjal Yagnik’s debut aims at Memento-like noir but doesn’t gather the narrative shards into a compelling whole</p><p>Mulholland Drive and Memento are celebrated examples of how narrative fragmentation can dovetail well with the philosophical heart and aims of film noir. While this low-budget thriller doesn’t have the finesse of either of those films, it does at least aim high in its sundered viewpoint on the jealousy-filled menage à trois at its centre. Debut director Munjal Yagnik plays it entirely non-linear to begin with, before settling into a more conventional but still mobile flashback structure.</p><p>Mark (Gregory Waits) wakes up in disarray, quickly turning into despair when he walks into the bedroom to find (what we assume is) his partner dead on the bed.

In 2024, Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris ran a campaign of moderation, reconciliation, and emphasis on restoring institutional norms.

In the months since their defeat, the Democrats have been confused, conflicted, and internally contentious over how to best proceed.</p><p>The results have been contradictory and ineffectual. The Democrats have alternated between declaring Trump a fascist and a would-be dictator, and congratulating themselves on peacefully handing over the reins of power to him; they have railed against his corruption and his subordination to the unelected South African billionaire Elon Musk, but have also made themselves available to cooperate with Musk’s project to g

<p>An intriguing study of Lorenzo Perrone, the bricklayer who helped the famous author survive Auschwitz – then lost the will to live</p><p>When Primo Levi, the Turin-born chemist and nuanced chronicler of the human condition, pondered quite how he had survived Auschwitz, he gave the credit to a gruff bricklayer called Lorenzo Perrone: “not so much for his material aid”, he wrote, “as for his having constantly reminded me by his presence, by his natural and plain manner of being good, that there still existed a just world outside our own, something and someone still pure and whole, not corrupt, not savage, extraneous to hatred and terror… for which it was worth surviving”.</p><p>Perrone was, like Levi, from Piedmont (in north-western Italy), but he wasn’t a prisoner: he was one of the workers outside the camp. He passed Levi bread, soup and clothing, he wrote postcards to Italy on his behalf and brought Levi the replies. “For all this he neither asked nor accepted any reward,” Levi w
