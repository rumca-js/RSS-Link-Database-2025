<p>To be candid, many of the discounts are the result of TVs naturally falling in price this time of year more than any Super Bowl-specific sales. In general, most TVs follow a similar pricing timeline: release in the spring, drop a little over the summer, receive a larger price cut around the holidays, then gradually become cheaper until being discontinued the next year. This pattern has taken shape

<p>Convenience has always been the big promise of robot vacuums.

<p>If you’ve just picked up one of the latest Apple iPhone 16 models, you may be wondering what the best way is to keep your shiny new handset protected and free from scratches. That’s where a good protective case comes in. Let’s face it, accidents happen. Whether it’s an unexpected drop, scratches from your keys or just daily wear and tear, your Apple smartphone can easily get dented or scuffed. A high-quality case will act like armor, preventing scratches, dents and cracks. And some cases go beyond just basic protection – they include extra features like raised edges around the camera to shield the most vulnerable parts of your device, and cutouts for easy access to the camera control button, action button and USB-C port (you may also want to consider a screen protector to go along with it).<br><br>Of course, not all cases are created equal. Some are designed for heavy-duty protection, ideal if you’re someone who’s constantly on the go or prone to accidents, while others are more a
