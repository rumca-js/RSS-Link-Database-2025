								<p>Sometimes in <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>, the fundamental gaminess of it all - stats, mechanics, and objectives - blind us to fantasy’s in-built capacity for entertaining nonsense. Sure, having a plus one version of your weapon, or an amulet that grants crucial damage resistances, could be essential to surviving a perilous quest - but will it make you smile? Will it, even for a moment, lighten the crushing weight of our existence on this pale blue dot? Maybe - I’m not the boss of you - but I hope these stupid joke items have a better chance of raising chuckles around your table.</p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pokémon Prismatic Evolutions</strong> is as beautiful as it is cruel, delivering pack after pack of disappointment and heartbreak. Each seal you rip teases you with the chance of seeing one of the extremely rare Eeveelution SIRs, always somehow just out of reach. However, it’s not all bad news, as Umbreon ex and Espeon ex are reportedly going to be promo cards in an upcoming Premium Collection.</span></p>

								<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card Varina, Lich Queen has seen a huge price spike of over 2000%. Worth only 50 cents in late January, the cheapest copy of this card now costs as much as $10.80. However, it is worth saying that it seems like, after an initial mammoth bump, that price could now be on the way back down.</p>

								<p>Where to start with a strategy game as mammoth as <strong>Civilization 7</strong>? There are so many things we could talk about, from new systems and big changes to those gorgeous graphics. I’m having to fight against the urge to dive down into the minutiae right away.</p>
<p>It’s still Civ. I think that’s the most important thing I can communicate to the reader. In the early days of Civilization 7’s marketing there were some fears that the game had gone too far, that it would be too big a break from what had come before.

RedBert, a German physics student, first posted his creation to Reddit in November 2024.
