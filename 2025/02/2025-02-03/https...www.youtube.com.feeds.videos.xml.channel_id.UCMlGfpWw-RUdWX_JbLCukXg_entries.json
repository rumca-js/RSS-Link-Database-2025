Properly utilizing function interfaces, data types, and ensuring correct data flow are part of the challenge during programming of IPC applications. Furthermore, debugging run-time bugs coming from IPC are some of the hardest and most time-consuming bugs.\n\nWe leverage the power of C++20 and concepts to define modern interfaces and constraints, that make IPC programs easy to understand. We introduce a pattern called CCI (Concept, Constraint, and Implementation) to facilitate the creation of modern interfaces encapsulating low-level IPC functions. Therefore, we mitigate numerous pitfalls stemming from IPC programming and prevent run-time bugs.\n\nAfter explaining CCI and getting a goo",
