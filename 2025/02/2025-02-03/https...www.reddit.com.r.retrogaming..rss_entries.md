I can pick a game, but don&#39;t know the key sequence. I thought I would hit start and set another menu. Does anyone have any instructions to help me? Learning to be a retro gamer at 65.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m one region away from completing pokemmo but I&#39;m getting worn out of the same story and same gameplay. Unbound seems like a nice departure. But I also randomly got the itch for another trigger playthrough. I can&#39;t decide which one to start. Is unbound really that different or would I be happier with trigger since it&#39;s been a while? I always use the psx version because I&#39;m a basically l masochist for those sweet sweet added cutscenes. What&#39;s added in unbound?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am sorry if I may have brought up this particular subject here before recently, but lately it’s been bugging me because something I noticed about old video games is that ownership tends to become confusing as many old games have been difficult to bring back on modern distribution platforms because no can tell who owns the rights to those games.</p> <p>Some examples include the older game catalog of Monolith as for instance, almost exactly 10 years ago today, they had a game called NOLF that almost came back to modern platforms such as Steam, but what I don’t understand is why the executives behind WB’s gaming department could not sort out the rights to the game as what baffles me is that since WB technically owns the rights to the NOLF series that they refused to let Nightdive Studios continue with the remaster.</p> <p>Again, I am sorry if I may have asked about this stuff before here, but it’s just that I still have a difficult time understanding
