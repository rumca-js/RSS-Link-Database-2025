<p>An external streaming device is the best way to access online video services without replacing your entire TV. By plugging one of these devices into your TV’s HDMI port, you’ll be able to use apps like Netflix and Hulu, possibly with a faster and smoother experience than your TV’s built-in software.</p>



<p>But between Roku, Fire TV, Google TV, and Apple TV, picking a streaming device can be overwhelming. We’ve reviewed them all and have come up with a list of recommendations for every need and budget.</p>

<p>As TechHive’s resident cord-cutting expert, I’ve reviewed practically every streaming device that’s come out over the past decade, and I’ve been a cord-cutter myself since 2008. Beyond just product reviews, I write a <a href="https://www.techhive.com/blogs/c

<p>Until now, if you wanted to play the classic computer games <em>The Sims</em> from 2000 and <em>The Sims 2</em> from 2004, you needed the original CD-ROMs or DVDs. But that’s about to change.</p>



<p>In celebration of the franchise’s 25th anniversary, Electronic Arts is releasing <em>The Sims Legacy Collection</em> and <em>The Sims 2 Legacy Collection</em> for Windows 10 and 11. These are re-releases of each game and their expansion packs, respectively.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s powerhouse collection of useful Windows utilities, PowerToys, is adding the ability to strip out an audio track from a video file, plus the more general ability to transcode video files as well.</p>



<p>Microsoft isn’t adding an additional app to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/563788/seven-ways-in-which-microsofts-powertoys-improves-my-life.html">PowerToys, a collection of more than a dozen powerful, free, Windows utilities</a>. Instead, this new feature is being added to Advanced Paste, so that you’ll be able to “paste” an audio track or video file somewhere else.

<p>It’s hard to find a cheap laptop out there. Well, that’s not quite true. It’s hard to find a cheap laptop <em>that’s actually worth buying</em>.</p>



<p>But today Staples has one that’s a godsend if you’re in the market for an affordable laptop that can run Windows well. The <a href="https://www.staples.com/asus-vivobook-15-15-6-laptop-1-4ghz-intel-core-5-120u-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-windows-11-home-f1504vp-sb54/product_24595128">Asus Vivobook 15 is just $379.99</a>, a whopping $220 off its retail price.</p>



<p>I won’t lie to you. This is still a budget model and it’s not going to compete with the latest Zenbook, XPS, or Surface in performance, fit, or finish. But it <em>does</em> have a very recent Intel Core 5 120U processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s the bare minimum I would recommend for a Windows laptop these days, considering the memory overhead

<p>Forget laptops. If you want a powerful yet affordable computer and you don’t need portability, then what you <em>really</em> need is a mini PC.</p>



<p>Right now, you can snag this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Gaming-8845HS-5-1GHz-Computer/dp/B0D3GDKZ93/">crazy Beelink SER8 mini PC for $479 on Amazon</a>, a massive discount from its original $749.

<p>The CapacMouse Pro is the size of a car remote and can fit on a keychain to be carried around in your pocket. Yet it’s still equipped with two main buttons, two side buttons, and two scroll buttons. The mouse’s DPI and scroll sensitivity can be changed using certain button combinations (with DPI options from 1000, 1600, 2400, and 4000).</p>

<p>Even if you’ve done a great job looking after your devices, chances are you will have a few much-loved USB cables that look worse for wear. Fraying or breaking cables will mostly work when you need them to, which makes it easy to fob them off as a problem to be sorted out later. But there are good reasons why you should pay closer attention.</p>



<p>The biggest has to do with safety. Fraying USB cables pose a very small, but albeit still noteworthy, risk of causing electric shock or fire. It’s for that reason most experts will err on the side of caution and recommend you just bite the bullet and throw out worn cables.</p>



<p>If that’s not enough to motivate you to let them go, then perhaps this fact will: Fraying USB cables can actually damage your devices. They have been known to partially or fully short circuit, cause fluctuating electrical charges,

<p>If you were hoping to get your hands on a new, incredibly powerful, incredibly expensive Nvidia graphics card… maybe it’s time to make like Luke Skywalker and find a new hope.

<p>Despite ever-improving junk mail filters and more sophisticated defense measures, phishing<strong> </strong>is still one of the biggest threats to cyber security and they’re becoming increasingly difficult to recognize. Criminals are using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to formulate their emails, which results in largely error-free texts with correct grammar and  understandable sentence structure.</p>



<p>As hackers become more advanced, you’ll need to learn new methods to detect them and stay one step ahead of the game. Below we’ll share a few ways you can catch them in the act, and hopefully avoid falling prey to their scams.</p>
