We are pleased to announce The School of Life's new podcast The Workshop, with Alain de Botton & John Armstrong. The podcast takes you behind the scenes of our organisation – and lets you listen to our ideas taking form.

We long for love to last forever, and yet experience shows us that it seems often and perhaps always to end. John and Alain ask why love can die and resist the thought that it must, arriving at a host of suggestion for how we can protect our loves from the corrosive effects of ingratitude and neglect.

We are pleased to announce The School of Life's new podcast The Workshop, with Alain de Botton & John Armstrong. The podcast takes you behind the scenes of our organisation – and lets you listen to our ideas taking form.

In this episode, Alain and John consider the question of whether it’s ever really possible to change other people, be they our partners, our friends, our children or our colleagues. They explore why we’re so resistant to attempts to ‘correct’ our behaviour, the role of humour in teaching, and why getting someone to change might be as difficult as climbing K2 in one’s slippers…
