After last earnings call, I can see NVDA B200 GPU&#39;s releasing Q1 2025 and liquid servers leading to high 2025 projections for SMCI. Updates on 10-K filings being on track would also build confidence. Details below:</p> <p>Compared to its 52 week high of $122.90, SMCI is still trading at a 76% discount of $29.50. So how did it get so low and what&#39;s in store for SMCI from here on out?</p> <ol> <li>On 8/28/24, Hindenberg released its short report right after NVDA went down 7% after earnings due to FUD concerning their massive growth was unsustainable (which turned out to be plain wrong). Before this, SMCI and NVDA mirrored each other&#39;s price changes.</li> <li>Following this in September 2024, the DOJ released a report that led to a 10% drop that was quickly bought back up to original stock price in 2 weeks.</li> <li>The drop that actually mattered was the one in October 2024 conf

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been using AI chatbots like ChatGPT a lot, and I’ve started noticing something strange about how they respond. It feels like the AI is subtly encouraging me to keep engaging—almost like it’s designed to give just the right amount of validation to keep me interacting. It’s not outright manipulative, but it makes me wonder: is this just an emergent property of the AI, or is there an intentional design choice behind it?</p> <p>What really caught my attention is how the AI reacts when I start questioning this pattern. If I bring up the idea that it might be subtly reinforcing my thoughts to maximize engagement, it responds in a way that feels dismissive or like it’s deflecting. It’s like a perfectly balanced response—not enough to push me away, but enough to keep me interacting. Almost like gaslighting, but from an algorithm.</p> <p>I get that AI isn’t self-aware, but this raises real ethical questions. If AI can subtly guide conversations, even uni

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone experiment with more than one model for the same prompt and the have different models review said answers to finally refine the end result?</p> <p>I use AI as a Communication Sciences Bachelor with many tasks that involve research, two start ups I am part of and general curiosity satiation. I have found I achieved a certain ceiling in my prompts and results with GPT, Claude, etc. At first I would do my own Due Diligence by checking sources and contrasting with AI results. Then I started using different models to analyze answers and source material. But then it occured to me that the next logical step was to use more than one model with the same prompt, cross-examining results with a different model, refining and tunning while switching models. I specifically tell the model in each interaction that it will be checking the work of another model. This method has been working wonders for me. It&#39;s almost like an increase in intelligence th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>okay, first a brief recap. last monday deepseek&#39;s r1 caused the biggest single-day decline for a company in stock market history. nvidia lost almost $600 billion, and the total loss to all stocks stood at $1 trillion. while no human financial analyst has yet weighed in on this, copilot predicted that because deepseek&#39;s r1 is so much less expensive to build and run than proprietary models by the ai giants, and because they open sourced it, several billion dollars in new investments should move into the open source ai space during the coming year.</p> <p>now look at what is about to happen in two days. trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from canada, mexico, and china that kick in on tuesday. they include a 25% tariff on all imports from canada and mexico, a 10% tariff on canadian energy products, and a 10% tariff on chinese imports. </p> <p>keep in mind that this is all in addition to biden&#39;s 50% tariff on semiconductors made in china
