Having gone to Bournemouth <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/01/bournemouth-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">and taken care of business</a> in a match their own manager suggested could have gone either way but for a couple of iffy decisions, a tight offside and some better finishing from the home side, Liverpool managed to put more distance between themselves and their nearest rivals, only to glance in the rear-view mirror last night to see the green and goofy face of

<p>This fervently acted Irish film about a dispute between farmers begins with some sheep rustling and ends in Peckinpah-esque violent horror</p><p>A tang of bad blood rises from this flawed revenge-feud drama set in the rural west of Ireland from first-time feature director Christopher Andrews, in which the audience might be shocked by male violence but are at the same time required to sympathise with the male characters’ inner wounded sensitivity. It’s strongly and fervently acted, but for me finally let down by a bizarre and almost farcical flourish of Peckinpah-esque violent horror, which undermines the accessible emotional reality of what has been happening, and which doesn’t quite do justice to the sustained effort required for a specific act of grotesque butchery.</p><p>The title refers at one level to a decision to bring livestock down from the grazing hillside to the fields, but also implies a terrible, willed catastrophe.

We can’t deny that Alex [Greenwood] not being there is really difficult. I think Rebecca [Knaak] has done well but it’s a big step up. We’ve not been able to really refresh the backline at all, so those guys are consistently playing. We just need to improve and get better.” <strong>TG</strong></p

<p>Arsenal relish City demolition as Sels shines while Liverpool carry on regardless at the top</p><p>Any successful title challenge needs a statement victory to install belief and reset previous concerns. Beating Manchester City must now be Arsenal’s foundation and not the zenith. Arsenal have played much of this season as if distracted by situations beyond their control – referees, their rivals’ dispositions and their relative luck with injuries. The second-half performance was a reminder of how Mikel Arteta previously took Arsenal to the verge of title wins, playing high-grade attacking football, pressing their opponents into mistakes. Has the high-quality football returned at the right time? Arteta’s team maintained discipline, not rising to provocations before taking advantage of City’s malfunctions to run in five goals. All without Bukayo Saka, whose loss was supposed to be the end of the affair. In Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, both on the scoresheet, the next generati

<p>After 36 glorious years we will miss this defiantly different programming once it has been swallowed up by TNT Sports</p><p>So farewell then, Eurosport. For 36 years you were the bric-a-brac of satellite channels, dishing up the curios and the comforting, the magnificent and the strange. You were the friend we ignored for weeks at a time, until the Australian&nbsp;Open, the Giro D’Italia, or some esoteric sport from an unpronounceable place lured us back in. Although we never did get round to buying that 16-CD pack of German soft-rock classics for an unbeatable low price, which you peddled during every advert break in the late 1990s.</p><p>And now, on 28 February, you are to be killed off, with your tastiest morsels <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/28/eurosports-end-of-an-era-in-britain-casts-doubts-on-future-free-to-air-coverage">assimilated into TNT&nbsp;Sports</a> behind an expensive paywall. Yes, you were occasionally mocked. But you really will be missed.</

<p>Steve Borthwick’s side still lack an effective Plan B while Warren Gatland’s aim is to avoid embarrassment in Rome</p><p>Few annual tournaments lay bare the truth as brutally or swiftly as the Six Nations. There are no play-yourself-in pool games, no one-off-the-mark half-volleys. The opposition want your guts from minute one and, particularly away from home, there is no hiding place. Even in boxing they allow you a pair of padded gloves and a breather every three minutes.</p><p>If you are not quite at the level of your opponent, even for a relatively short period of time, the scoreboard rarely lies. Until their late, late flurry in Dublin, England were 27-10 down and already pinned on the ropes.

<p>In this collection of social commentary and interviews, the novelist sheds light on the artistic process and her need to help shape the cultural landscape</p><p>In the introduction to <em>I Want </em><em>to Talk </em><em>to You</em>, her first volume of collected essays and nonfiction, the award-winning novelist Diana Evans offers possibly the most succinct and accurate distinction between the modes of journalism and fiction that I have encountered in 25 years of trying to do both. “The journalism voice is direct, conspicuous and definite. The fiction voice is nebulous, shadowy, prefers to disappear in order to speak.” After four successful novels and more than two decades of writing across the British press, for magazines such as <em>Pride</em>, <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Granta</em>, plus the <em>Observer</em> and the <em>Financial Times</em>, Evans goes on to explain: “They’re still arguing. They still would rather I choose between them.” But she has eventually concluded that both
