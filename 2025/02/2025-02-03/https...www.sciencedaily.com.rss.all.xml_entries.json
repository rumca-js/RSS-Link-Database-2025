        "description": "Early detection of earthquakes could be vastly improved by tapping into the world's internet network with a groundbreaking new algorithm, researchers say. Fiber optic cables used for cable television, telephone systems and the global web matrix now have the potential to help measure seismic rumblings thanks to recent technological advances, but harnessing this breakthrough has proved problematic. A new paper seeks to address these challenges by adapting a simple physics-based algorithm to include fiber optic data that can then be used hand-in-hand with traditional seismometer measurements.",

Now, scientists have identified chemical compounds released by rice roots that determine how much methane the plants emit. They report that this information enabled them to breed a new strain of rice that emits up to 70% less methane.",

But these microscopic troublemakers have hidden their inner workings behind a maze of complexity. That is, until now. Researchers have now revealed the specific shape and structure of one of the body's most important yet complicated proteins: ApoB100. Acting as a kind of molecular exoskeleton, this protein wraps around LDL particles, allowing them to travel through the bloodstream, researchers found.",
