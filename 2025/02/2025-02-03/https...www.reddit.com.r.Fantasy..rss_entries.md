<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hellooo, just wanted to ask if someone has an adult fantasy series, where the MC is the reincarnation of a god or some sort of holy entity, set in an military or other form of school. I was thinking about something like Avatar the last Airbender, with a similar elementar magic system and with a found family. And yes I‚Äôve read the Avatar novels, but I was thinking of a more adult version. Thanks :) üôèüèª </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slutforyourmomm"> /u/Slutforyourmomm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ih34l2/very_specific_book_recommendation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ih34l2/very_specific_book_recommendation/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From books and games we&#39;re exposed to all types of elemental systems. Do you like the simple systems like the standard 4? Earth, Fire, Wind, Water? Slightly expanded like the usual 4 with Light and Dark? Or something complex like pokemon with like 20 elements and all sorts of interactions.</p> <p>I like a complex system with nuance to it, but based on a simpler system, like main elements with sub-elements, such as water as the main and Ice as a sub-element.</p> <p>What interactions annoy you? I hate that Electricity is almost always lumped in with air, or if you say storm magic or weather magic, people just think of thunderstorms instead of all the various types of weather like snowstorms etc. I also dislike ice being weak to fire in a lot of cases because if you can control ice, you contrl water, and when ice melts...</p> <p>What books have your favorite examples of elemental systems or examples of interactions you enjoy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --

He was murdered and she discovered he had a mask hidden that he shouldn‚Äôt have had. I think only certain religious people were allowed to have them? </p> <p>So she takes the mask and runs and during the story she puts in on and gains some sort of power while wearing it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there! Basically as stated in the title. I‚Äôm specifically looking for something similar to The Roots of Chaos series, since I enjoyed it so much and I really like the worldbuilding and the medium/slow pace of the whole story, where we get to see the characters in their day to day lives and the politics of the world. I know a bunch of classic Adult High Fantasy books that match those requirements, but they don‚Äôt have a main sapphic romance (or any at all). I don‚Äôt need the romance to be the main focus as long as it has some focus, I don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs standalone or a series, but please only High Fantasy! I know we have some amazing books that are also Sci-Fi (like TLT series) and urban fantasy, but it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for. Also it should be adult, I have nothing against YA but I‚Äôd like more complexity to the plot.</p> <p>For reference I‚Äôve already read Gideon the Ninth and Baru Cormorant (loved both but I‚Äôd say they are not proper fantasy boo

A month or so ago I stepped away from Instagram and Facebook (because Mark Zuckerberg is a human piece of excrement, among other reasons) and decided to read more often rather than scrolling. Being a fantasy/sci fi reader, I ended up on this sub Reddit. Every time I have posed a question or made a comment, people have responded with respect and been so helpful. There have been a couple times I have misquoted or confused authors and folks just gently redirected rather than trying to make me feel stupid. I don‚Äôt hang out on Reddit a ton, but I can tell you from what I have seen that this is not the case in other communities I have seen. In fact, this is one of the only places I feel comfortable posting, or interacting with posts at all.

A psychedelic doom metal band, with a Sabbath Worship vibe, but there are a lot of bands like that, what makes them stand out, is not just their technical ability, imaginative lyrics or impressive vocals, is that they have a fantasy, a story to tell and thanks to their abilities they tell it well and in an interesting way. Castle Rat is not just a band, its an adventuring party a drummer Druid, a bassist Plague Doctor, a guitarist Count and of course the the Rat queen on vocals, together they venture to face their nemesis, the Rat Reaperess. With how commited are in their characters its easy to get immersed in the fantacy. In their music videos they lean on this even heavier, showing you the story of the Dagger Dragger showing us the story of a monster huntress that accidentally kills her lover who comes back as an evil spirit.

In the north a man sings to an ice-dragon to bring snows that prevents raiding horsemen entering the passes, and in the forest itself a woman sings to the cedars and feeds the unicorns who bring a sickness that prevents armies of the Empire coming through.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something I‚Äôve been thinking about is how The Lord of the Rings is often seen as the ultimate template for fantasy‚Äîa kind of benchmark against which many other works are measured. But when it comes to science fiction, we have Dune, which is a towering giant, yet it doesn‚Äôt seem to hold the same monopoly over the genre. Dune is praised, analyzed, and discussed, but there‚Äôs no expectation that all sci-fi should resemble Dune in the same way that fantasy often feels tied to Tolkien‚Äôs tradition.</p> <p>Why is that? Is it because fantasy leans more heavily on mythology and classic adventure structures that Tolkien refined? Or is it because science fiction, by its nature, is more diverse in its expressions and themes?</p> <p>What do you think? Do you also feel like there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúTolkien shadow‚Äù over fantasy, while sci-fi gets to be more experimental? And how does that affect the kinds of stories that get told in the two genres?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

I have not read the books before so it‚Äôs my first experience with Inn. </p> <p>I must say I kind of like it, but also a lot of the characters and world building somehow rub me the wrong way, and I cannot quite put my finger on it.</p> <p>For the audio: I think Andrea Parsneau does a decent job with different voices, also considering that the are so many characters of different races. She manages to give the bigger characters a unique voice though many of the Drakes, for example, do sound similar.</p> <p>However what gets me is that there is almost always this feeling of great anxiety and shock in her voice. It is especially with Ry-Oka (?), and while it does make sense to show her unsolved issues and fears, it is so very annoying to listen to an hour of a Ry-Oka chapter where Andrea‚Äôs voice is just constantly trembling, like she

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Those that have read both Book of the New Sun and Second Apocalypse</p> <p>Which is harder to follow/understand? I‚Äôve heard these are both notoriously difficult reads but are they difficult in the same ways? </p> <p>I‚Äôm wanting to read both of these series and thought I could start with whichever is more approachable between the two. I have read difficult and denser works like The Silmarillion, Blood Meridian, most of the Bible, Wheel of Time, etc. </p> <p>I‚Äôm interested in the philosophical/theological aspects to both of these series and the mix of fantasy/scifi </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/datjake"> /u/datjake </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igdlnz/to_those_whove_read_both/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igdlnz/to_those_whove_read_both/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve been into fantasy for a long time now but recently they all read very, very similarly. All the new ‚Äòromantasy‚Äô books feature identical headstrong protagonists with romance stories that are almost always enemies to lovers. When A Court of Thorns and Roses came out, I really loved it but I do think that Sarah J. Maas has become so incredibly popular that every romantic interest reads as a carbon copy of Rhysand and every protagonist a copy of Aelin. As a result I feel like I have to search in the epic/dark fantasy section as a way to completely escape the romantasy feel. Is it just me that feels this way? Let me know any recommendations you have please I need help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/reservoir_phrog"> /u/reservoir_phrog </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igccnm/need_fresh_fantasy_recs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When is the 2025 Top Novels Poll going to be posted? (I know its probably not for quite a while, but something more specific than &#39;the end of the year&#39; would be appreciated) I have missed every single one so far despite being in this sub for years. I always see it like a week or 2 later when the polling is already closed. I really don&#39;t want to miss the next one!</p> <p>Also, a note for everyone who puts the poll together - would be cool to leave the voting open for longer so that there is a higher chance of more people being able to vote!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Any-Syllabub8168"> /u/Any-Syllabub8168 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igbpkr/top_fantasy_novels_polls/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igbpkr/top_fantasy_novels_polls/">[comments]</a></span>
