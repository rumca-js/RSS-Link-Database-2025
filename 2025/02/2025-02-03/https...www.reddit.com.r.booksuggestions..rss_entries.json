It\u2019s habit at this point and I do love psycho analysis. Sometimes it feels like if I have the time to read, I should optimize it for work. And I just don\u2019t know what I like anymore outside of it. Sometimes I just want a book that doesn\u2019t make me think so much, or can provide an escape. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I read a book for fun that I loved. I think I would prefer a series. I liked them a lot when I was younger.

Ever since reading All of Us Villains and All of Our Demise. That sent me looking for more like that, which is how I found Throne in the Dark. I also like Grim in Lightlark, I\u2019m here for the dark tormented souls that are morally grey, but also care for that one person. They don\u2019t care if they are a bad person. </p> <p>I want to read anything like this with a villain/dark/morally grey character. Enemies to lovers, all for it. But I\u2019m also looking for something specific.</p> <p>VvVvVvVvV</p> <p><em>Spoiler</em> All Of Our Demise </p> <p>. .</p> <p>I want something like I liked Isobel with Alistair, but I liked Isobel with Reid EVEN MORE! I want something like that! Call me toxic. Idc. He was horrible, the actual bad guy and held her hostage. But in the end, she ended up caring for him. Which, it was all a messed up situation.

Her husband has disappeared, and although she denies having anything to do with it, the police point her out as the main suspect, alleging that she committed domestic violence against him. The situation takes a turn when they find her husband&#39;s body buried in their own yard, but the body has been there much longer than he has been missing. This reveals a dark secret: she has been living with an imposter all this time. Throughout the story, chapters from the actress&#39; present and past are interspersed, showing the traumatic events that have defined her. In her childhood, she was kidnapped by a woman who had lost her daughter. This woman and her husband raised her as their own daughter, changing her name and involving her in their illegal gambling business, until they were both murdered by the police. Although she wa",
