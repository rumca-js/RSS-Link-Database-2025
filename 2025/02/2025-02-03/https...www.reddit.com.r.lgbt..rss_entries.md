<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a 6&#39; tall 225lb man with resting grump face. Ever since November, I&#39;ve gone out of my way to wear pride gear. My wife has been helping by buying me shirts based on the criteria of the more flamboyant, the better.</p> <p>I do this for two reasons</p> <p>1: I want members of the community to see me, and know that I am a safe person. If necessary, I want someone to think, maybe this person can help me.</p> <p>2: Emboldened bigots might want a target to pick on. I want to give them a target. I want to try to take attention away from more vulnerable members of the community.</p> <p>Over the months since the election, I have had dozens of interactions because of what I wear. On the one hand, I have had plenty of people smile and tell me they love my shirt. On the other hand, I&#39;ve also had plenty of people scowl at me, looking disgusted.</p> <p>Isn&#39;t it interesting how the ones who are offended by a big guy wearing a big rainbow hear

The usual stuff; her coworkers always leave a mess, did you see the Kanye thing, etc. Then she started talking about not caring what others think of you. It was honestly a great conversation we were having. I&#39;m <em>TERRIBLE</em> at holding conversations but it was like talking with an old friend.</p> <p>So at one point she comes up and quietly asks if she can ask a question. I already know what it is. Nobody has ever asked me this question before but I know what she&#39;s about to say. I say of course and she asks &quot;is your lifestyle <em>alternative</em>?&quot; I got the biggest smile, nodded, and said &quot;yes, I&#39;m transitioning.&quot;</p> <p>So we began to discuss what that means. I talked about having to leave my home state so I could transition safely. She had no idea Florida hated trans people and assumed the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a lie being told over and over again, one designed to erase, dismiss, and diminish. It is the claim that LGBTQ+ identities are new, that they are a modern trend, that they didn’t exist in history until recently. But that narrative is not just wrong - it is a deliberate attempt to ignore reality.</p> <p>LGBTQ+ people have always been here. The evidence is everywhere. The first written records from ancient Sumer mention gender nonconforming priests who served the goddess Inanna. In ancient Egypt, two men, Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, were buried together in a way that mirrors depictions of married couples. In Greece and Rome, same-sex relationships were openly acknowledged, and historical figures like Alexander the Great had relationships with both men and women. The poet Sappho wrote about love between women long before modern society assigned labels to those experiences. Indigenous cultures across North America recognized Two-Spirit people as
