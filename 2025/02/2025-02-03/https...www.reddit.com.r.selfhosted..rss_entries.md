It works great, I can use my subdomain.domain.smth to reach that service. </p> <p>Now when I try to access directly to domain.smth (without any subdomain) I get a page from the frp service telling that this is not configured, which is true. However I can&#39;t find how to setup redirection for the main domain, it seems that frp only works with subdomains. Have I missed something?</p> <p>The ultimate goal would be to reach my service when using the subdomain, and get another service (typically a website) when accessing the domain alone.
