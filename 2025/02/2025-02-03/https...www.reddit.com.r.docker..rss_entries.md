Would it make things easier, or is it just unnecessary complexity for game servers?</p> <p>Would love to hear from anyone who has tried this. Is Docker the way to go, or should I just run everything directly on the machine with <code>screen</code> / <code>tmux</code>?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FortiByte"> /u/FortiByte </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1igroy5/should_i_use_docker_for_game_servers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/

Is there an issue with doing this or should it be mounted so that it is owned as the default user. the reason i ask is because i ran in to a permission issue where the puid and guid were set to 1000 and had to change to 0 so it would work correctly. </p></li> <li><p>Should mount the network share once to the root of the share and then path out each blind mount as required for the containers or should i mount each folder that i require for the container and then blind mount each from its own /mnt location. </p></li> </ol> <p>The share location is on the local networ

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently mount an NFS share to /mnt/storage0 I then use /mnt/storage0/Docker/xyz as a bind mount for every config type of mount location for my containers. This really handnt been a problem, i migrated everything to a new server, and everything works, but....It seems like anything with a db (sqlite, etc) is pretty slow to run now. I tried moving some of them to non NFS bind mounts and it seemed to improve. I&#39;m using the default options for mounting from /etc/fstab. Could it be I just need to use some options like nolock, etc?</p> <p>I did try CIFS mounts, but the whole permissions not changing thing with items like acme.json and some db&#39;s made it a no go.</p> <p>Thoughts on what I might be doing wrong? /etc/fstab</p> <pre><code>10.23.0.10:/zfs0 /mnt/storage0 nfs defaults 0 0 </code></pre> <p>NFS Export</p> <pre><code>/zfs0 -fsid=20a733cc-5ece-4ff2-b1fe-faa89578ccb8 *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash) </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON -
