<p>It’s been nice to see the growing&nbsp;popularity of Indian cinema in the States. For many people — especially those not familiar with the work of the legendary Satyajit Ray — their entry place was Aamir Khan’s excellent 2001 cricket drama <em>Lagaan</em>, the most recent Indian film to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. For others, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23478046/rrr-ss-rajamouli-movies-top-gun-avengers-future

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best streaming device in my living room used to be my PlayStation 5. But it has become a hindrance recently, inexplicably buffering all the time and loading shows at low quality. I swapped it for Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max and wasn’t expecting much, but, well, it’s now been a few weeks since I last used my PS5. This capable streaming gadget is currently available for almost half off from Amazon, costing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9">$34.99</a> when you use the offer code <strong>4KFTVGAME</strong> at checkou

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new game releases this week are full of action in different flavors. You can travel back in time and pick up a sword, strap on a guitar and noodle away monsters, or fight literal boredom as you wait for a bus to arrive. Or you can skip all that and be a spell-thirsty witch. It’s a big week for RPG and puzzle fans who want to play something a little outside the norm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The week starts off strong with <em>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</em>, a gem-matching game with an adorable art style. The long-awaited sequel to <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">For more than 30 years, the Civilization franchise has sold the fantasy of commanding an empire on the world stage. You take control of a leader and a people and you pursue the development of technology and culture. You seize land, you fight wars, and you make your way through thousands of years of simulated time in order to trace the pathways of domination and subordination. It’s an old story, and the newest entry, <em>Civilization 7</em>, was made by a team that clearly understands that the fantasy needs a shakeup.&nbsp;</p>

It’s making its debut during Max Monday on Feb. 3  from 6-7 p.m. and will be available until Feb. 10 when the Max Battle rotation swaps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Dynamax Moltres isn’t as hard as the very tough Gigantamax battles we’ve seen in the past, it can be tricky as there’s not many Dynamax Pokémon to use to counter it.</p>
