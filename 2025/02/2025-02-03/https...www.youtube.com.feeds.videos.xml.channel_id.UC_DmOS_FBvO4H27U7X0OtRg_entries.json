Voodoo is a deeply rooted spiritual tradition in Benin, recognized as an official religion. Originating in West Africa, it involves the worship of spirits and ancestors, rituals, drumming, and trance ceremonies. Voodoo plays a central role in West African culture, influencing art, music, and daily life. In this video we were assaulted by a spirit, and then we fell down a rabbit hole of beatings, alcohol, and sacrifice. Anyway, enjoy the adventure!\n\nVOODOO CEREMONY VIDEO HERE: https://youtu.be/PovFYQ6TLY4\n\nBig love to Last Places Travel for putting this WILD trip together for us:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lastplacestravel\n\nJoin our Expeditions & Adventure Retreats\nwww.fearlessandfar.com/trips\n\nMy packing list + Adventure Filmmaking Gear is here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/fearlessfar\n\nStart your QUEST and claim the Bold & Adventurous life you deserve:",
