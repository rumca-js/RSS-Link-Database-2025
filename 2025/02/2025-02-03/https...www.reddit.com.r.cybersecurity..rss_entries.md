<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>We know things are a bit chaotic right now, especially for those of you in the US. There are a lot of changes happening, and for many people, it’s a stressful and uncertain time. Cybersecurity and policy are tightly connected, and we understand that major government decisions can have a real impact on security professionals, businesses, and industry regulations.</p> <p>That said, <a href="/r/cybersecurity">r/cybersecurity</a> is first and foremost a <strong>cybersecurity</strong> community, not a political battleground. Lately, we’ve seen an increasing number of posts that, while somewhat related to cybersecurity, quickly spiral into political arguments that have nothing to do with security.</p> <p>So, let’s be clear about what’s <strong>on-topic</strong> and what’s <strong>not</strong>.</p> <h1>This Is a Global Community FIRST</h1> <p>Cybersecurity is a global issue, and this subreddit reflects that.
