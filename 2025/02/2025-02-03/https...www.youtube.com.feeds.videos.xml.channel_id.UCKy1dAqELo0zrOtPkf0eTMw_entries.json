Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\"In many ways, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 feels like it\u2019s picked up and run with the reactive first-person RPG torch that Bethesda left lying in the mud years ago in pursuit of a broader audience. And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it's not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn't get in the way of the other, and you\u2019re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story.\"",

        "description": "Watch IGN's The Monkey review by Tom Jorgensen to find out what we think of this new horror comedy movie.\n\nThe Monkey marches to the beat of its own, bloodstained drum \u2013 and it\u2019s an irresistible rhythm to groove to. Osgood Perkins and cast balance the horror and comedy inherent in the movie\u2019s silly premise exceptionally well, and the surreal, absurd touches the Longlegs director adds to a world sketched out by Stephen King only help to set it apart from less imaginative, body count-obsessed movies. The evil influence of the titular, cursed toy results in blockbuster showcases for fantastic gore effects that, when paired with the film\u2019s surprisingly gentle stance on the inevitability of death, affirm how potent horror-comedy can be when executed with a strong perspective and a willingness to get weird.\n\n#Movies #Film #IGN",

        "description": "Civilization 7 reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC, also available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, Mac, and Linux.\n\n\"With Civilization 7, the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface. It\u2019s frustratingly inadequate at providing me with the information I need to play well, or even understand what's going on sometimes. Even so, it does have improved warfare and diplomacy, a bit of added narrative flair, as well as mostly gorgeous graphics and sound, so it can still give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night. There\u2019s good reason to believe that with Firaxis\u2019s usual pace of patches and expansions it can refine its new ideas and become everything it ought to be, and while what\u2019s here right now is at least still a fun time, it\u2019s also a bigger step backward for the series than we\u2019re accustomed to when a new age dawns.\"",

The murderous doll is back, and this time she\u2019s not alone.\n\nSet two years after M3GAN, where a marvel of artificial intelligence went rogue and embarked on a murderous rampage and was subsequently destroyed, M3GAN\u2019s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma\u2019s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma\u2019s overprotective rules. Unbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno), the ultimate killer infiltration spy.
