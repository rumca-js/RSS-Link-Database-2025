Couple of the models I talked about:
Dark Techno Assassins: https://themakerscult.com/shop/product/dark-techno-brutus-assassin/
Basically all the Dark Eldar Proxies are from Artel W: https://artelw.com/Voidborn-Ancients-Space-Dark-Elves-c142993270

In this video Jay goes through some of his favorite proxy models and how to use them effectively! We have new videos every Monday, Wednesday and Friday!
