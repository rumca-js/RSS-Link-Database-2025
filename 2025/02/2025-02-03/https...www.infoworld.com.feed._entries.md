<p>Developers must be cautious about who they interact with and where contributions come from, warns a Linux Foundation blog post intended to help open-source developers navigate US OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanctions.</p>



<p>Published <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/navigating-global-regulations-and-open-source-us-ofac-sanctions">January 29</a> and titled, “Navigating Global Regulations and Open Source: US OFAC Sanctions,” the blog states that increased cybersecurity risk and regulatory compliance are creating burdens on open source communities that these communities must meet. While there are sanctions programs in place around the world, many developers will need t

<p>The European Union is backing a major AI initiative, OpenEuroLLM, in a bid to counter the dominance of Silicon Valley and China in artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>The initiative is being led by Jan Hajič, a computational linguist at Charles University in Czechia, and Peter Sarlin, co-founder of Silo AI.</p>



<p>“The models that OpenEuroLLM will build will be fully open, to exploit the advantages of Open Source that have been so successful in software development in the past,” Hajič told InfoWorld. This approach will allow the models to comply with EU regulations more easily, he said, adding that so-called open models from outside the EU are either only partially open (for example, just the

<p>In the area of programming automation, sometimes it’s better to fix a software problem by first analyzing the whole repository rather than guessing about what files are relevant to the problem. That’s particularly relevant when you are managing your project on <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3267565/what-is-github-more-than-git-version-control-in-the-cloud.html">GitHub</a> or one of its competitors, because problem tickets can be part of the repo.</p>



<p>If you can automate the entire fix, even better. Essentially, wholesale is better than retail. Why not use AI to fix entire problems rather than limiting it to completing a line of code?</p>

<p>If you’re responsible for security, you’d better be good at context switching. Enterprise infrastructure has never been more distributed, and the software stack has never had more moving parts. The average application today has more than 150 dependencies, <a href="https://b348659d.streaklinks.com/CSGenBVg4G8xXW6EZQwx1AqT/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonatype.com%2Fresources%2Fstate-of-the-software-supply-chain-2022%2Foss-dependency-management">according to Sonatype</a>, and major languages like Java release updates up to 10 times per year. </p>
