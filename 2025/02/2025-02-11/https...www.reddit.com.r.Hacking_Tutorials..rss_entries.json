The way I managed to do that is placing 1 of the machines as the target and the 6 others where intertwined and handling different tasks (e.g. static analysis, dynamic fuzzing, and exploit validation). </p> <p>After I saw success with x86 I decided to take things up a notch and start working on binary. I&#39;ve been feeding it malware samples, CTF challenge",
