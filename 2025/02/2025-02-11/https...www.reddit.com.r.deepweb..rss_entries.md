<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I realize this is not ideal, but I made my first dark web purchase last night via bitcoin.

I did search the sub so I apologize if I missed anything. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stellablack75"> /u/stellablack75 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1in0dzz/am_i_getting_scammed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1in0dzz/am_i_getting_scammed/">[comments]</a></span>
