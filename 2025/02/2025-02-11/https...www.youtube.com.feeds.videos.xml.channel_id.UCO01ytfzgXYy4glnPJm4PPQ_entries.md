Today on the Matt Walsh Show, millions of dollars have been wasted funding political propaganda masquerading as scientific research. It's fraud—plain and simple—and the Trump administration is trying to put an end to it. Also, why were taxpayers funding Sesame Street in Iraq? A Democratic senator says this was necessary for the sake of national security. We'll listen to his argument and discuss. And the Army releases its first effective recruitment ad in many years.
