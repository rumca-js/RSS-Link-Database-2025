I never told my dad directly, but I guess she did.</p> <p>Last week, he sat me down and just straight up told me I had to leave. No yelling, no argument, just like he was stating a fact. He said he wasn’t going to have “that kind of thing” in his house. I honestly thought he was joking at first.</p> <p>When I realized he was serious, I tried to talk to him, but he wasn’t listening. He just kept saying it wasn’t how he raised me, that I could “live that life” somewhere else. My mom didn’t say a word. Just stood there. I don’t even know if she agreed with him or if she was just too scared to say anything.</p> <p>I packed a bag and left. Been staying with a friend while I figure things out, but
