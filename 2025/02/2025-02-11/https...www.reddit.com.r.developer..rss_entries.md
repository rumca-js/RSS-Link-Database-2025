<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, trying to do some research and understand how other companies are looking at their developer budget costs. For those of you who have to manage a dev team and balance costs of your environments...do you often look at costs as per developer or per environment? Do you assess costs per month or per year? Do you try to balance staging vs prod with a certain ratio?</p> <p>For example, we look at costs of staging vs prod on a monthly basis, we don&#39;t really do it by individual dev but I&#39;m also a smaller company so im wondering if other companies do it differently if you&#39;re at a bigger company (or even if you&#39;re at small company like me)? </p> <p>Sorry, feel free to brain dump, just working to understand how others might do it differently than me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/getambassadorlabs"> /u/getambassadorlabs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comme

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’d like to share a bit about myself. I’ve been programming for about six years, and I’ve worked at two companies. Throughout these two companies, I’ve worked with four different clients.</p> <p>My goal when I joined the last company (which is an outsourcing firm) was to work for a globally recognized client. I finally made it, and that’s where my struggle began.</p> <p>I joined a project that, from what I had read, had a strong micro-management style. They would tell you exactly which line to modify, what description to use—everything. It felt a bit uncomfortable to me, but I decided not to focus on it and instead dedicate myself to other areas of interest.</p> <p>The issue was that every time I wrote code, if a variable or description wasn’t exactly as expected, it sometimes required modifying multiple parts of the code. In my opinion, this wasn’t efficient. The problem was that when I tried to speed things up, I got the impression that they wanted
