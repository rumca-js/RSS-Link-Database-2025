I heard that Docker runs all containers as root by default and it&#39;s better to run the container with an unprivileged user via the <code>-u</code> option (rule #2 of the cheat sheet). However when I checked installation guides of several Docker images that are popular around here (not talking about those that obviously need root privileges), the vast majority does not mention that you can use this option. I&#39;ve even tried running a couple of them as an unprivileged user but that usually resulted in various errors. The closest alternative I&#39;ve seen is being able to set a user via PUID/PGID env variables but if I understand it correctly the <code>-u</code> option is superior because with the env variables the container still starts as root and drops privileges later wher",

So like the title says, I&#39;m a first time builder looking to create a multi-media (TV, Movies, Books, etc.) server locally at home, instead of perpetually paying for a seedbox. However, I&#39;m currently facing a decent-sized hurdle. So, I purchased some drives (for a great price), but overlooked the fact that the drives are SAS, not SATA. After doing some research, I seen that it&#39;s <em>technically</em> possible to connect the drives to the motherboard by way of a PCI controller? I just wanted to know how futureproof this is? Like, for example if I wanted to then add SATA drives down the road, would it create an imbalance in any way? Do I need any other parts to make this happen? Also, just for some added clarification, here are some of the parts I am/were eyeing for my server/pc build prior to knowing my drives were SAS:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/black-fractal-design-define-7-xl-atx-full-tower/p/N82E16811352118?",
