One of the biggest ongoing issues in hospitals is patient falls: a problem that costs billions annually, prolongs hospital stays, and increases the workload on already overburdened nurses. While fall prevention strategies exist, most rely on manual observation and human intervention alone, which isn’t always feasible in high-stress environments.</p> <p>I’m working on a non-profit initiative to develop a wearable patch that tracks patient movement, predicts fall risk, and monitors real-time vital signs, including heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin temperature, oxygen saturation (SpO₂) if possible, and EKG monitoring. This system will use AI-driven analysis to provide early warnings before a fall happens, giving nurses a proactive tool to prevent patient injuries and
