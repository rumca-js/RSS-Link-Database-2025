<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Idk how i could titled it better but the thing is that i am not software engineer or anything. I dont have a degree in CS and i dont work as a developer. I am a water engineer and for my thesis i was using git bash with windows. I have always hates windows and i have used linux for a few years around covid. I love arch and pacman and yay and all that. The problem is that right now i want a nice looking but not bloated arch based distro. I have been hopping like crazy for the past two days. I feel like this happens to me every time. I somehow get overstimulated by it. I have OCD which makes it worse. So I installed vanilla arch with gnome to get the most minimal setup but then i didnâ€™t like the terminal and other customisation stuff so i installed kde and removed gnome but then i started getting lags and shit and whatnot. Now im thinking about endeavouros. Idk i just wanted to rant here. I feel like im stuck in a weird loop. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->
