On the other hand, cheaper USB cables that deliver faster-than-expected data transfer speeds can be a welcome surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alas, it\u2019s true that the data transfer speeds that are promised aren\u2019t always what you get from your USB cables when all is said and done. There are a few reasons for that, some of which aren\u2019t any fault of your cable, which I will touch on later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from that, though, you can use a simple manual calculation to determine your USB cable\u2019s data transfer speed. With this technique you can at least get a snapshot of what your USB cables are capable of so that you know which ones to buy again and which ones to avoid.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"but-first-a-caveat\">But f",
