Kennedy Jr. is poised to be confirmed as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Sen. Susan Collins said she was voting for him and is usually the holdout we all wait for to make a decision.

When a wee Brodigan first started hustling political content in 2009, he couldn't have dreamed of arranging words to form such a sentence. Let alone, do so in a positive manner. But, yes, our favorite government employee is moving up in the world and has landed an IT job with Secretary Marco Rubio. No doubt, the over-the-top media outrage helped. Big Balls is the first celebrity of the Second Coming of Trump. Revel in it. Because We The People have a fever, and the cure is more Big Balls.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">DOGE: America wants Big Balls back... <a href="https://t.co/whkuhLmlNs">pic.twitter.com/whkuhLmlNs</a><br/>‚Äî @amuse (@amuse) <a href="https://twitter.com/amuse/status/1888609442880766315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <s
