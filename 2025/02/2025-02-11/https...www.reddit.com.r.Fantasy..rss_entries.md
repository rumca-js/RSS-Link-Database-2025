I also generally prefer novels to short stories, which, if they are good, I wish were more fleshed out. And all the time I&#39;m reading an anthology I&#39;m aware that everyone will completely disagree about which stories are best and which are weakest. It&#39;s especially hard when this book has been critically adored, with a lot of hype surrounding it. What I got wasn&#39;t exactly what I expected. </p> <p>At first, good and promising, then I wasn&#39;t completely sure - then my opinion dropped like a stone after reading the third story, The Perfect Match, which was nothing more than an anti-Google/Meta/AI diatribe, with the thinnest disguise imaginable.

I‚Äôm looking for recommendations based on my favorite FSF novels I read last year.</p> <p>Both By Simon Jimenez - The Vanished Birds - A Spear Runs Through Water</p> <p>Both By M.L. Wang - Sword of Kaigen - Blood Over Bright Haven</p> <ul> <li>Untethered Sky by Fonda Lee (I did not love Jade City)</li> </ul> <p>I know they are all quite different but hopefully you all will have a variety of recommendations. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/twocatsandaloom"> /u/twocatsandaloom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1imlc96/unique_fsf_with_diverse_characters_by_diverse/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1imlc96/unique_fsf_with_diverse_characters_by_diverse/">[comments]</a></span>
