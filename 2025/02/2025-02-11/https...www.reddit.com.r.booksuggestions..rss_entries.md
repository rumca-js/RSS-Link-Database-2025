<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished reading Goodbye Eri by Tatsuki Fujimoto, and I realised that I haven‚Äôt really read anything before where characters are grieving before they‚Äôve lost someone. I lost my father last year to his 6-year battle with cancer, and it felt isolating at times trying to live and plan for the future while having that odd constant experience with me. I‚Äôm fine with almost any genre and focus, though poetry doesn‚Äôt really speak to me and I‚Äôd prefer for romance to not be the main/only focus. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IGuessIHaveAReddit"> /u/IGuessIHaveAReddit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1imlni7/fiction_books_about_pregrief/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1imlni7/fiction_books_about_pregrief/">[comments]</a></span>
