        "description": "Robin Hilton | February 11, 2025\nArtists who play the Tiny Desk aren't always sure what they're getting into. \"I wasn't expecting it to be in a big building,\" girl in red's Marie Ulven tells the NPR crowd. \"I thought I was going to go into a little house or something.\"\n\nAny confusion aside, Ulven and her band deliver a set suitable for the kind of cozy space she imagined, one of genuine charm, good humor and unbridled joy \u2014 a vibe that girl in red has always cultivated through music. She can find cause for celebration even in life's bleakest moments, like when Ulven and the band deploy rapid-fire handclaps during a song about the emptiness of unrequited love (\"Phantom Pain\") or the way she says \"Depression!\" with a smile and a cheerleader's fist in the air just before \"Summer Depression.\" \"It's a normal thing to feel like this,\" she sings, offering a much-needed dose of warmth and empathy on what was an otherwise chilly, overcast day in Washington, D.C.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Phantom Pain\"\n\"Summ",
