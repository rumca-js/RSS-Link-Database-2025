Places that are utterly alien. It was done some in Elric and Fiest did it a bit too. Also Amber did it quite well. A lot of authors touch on the subject but usually it&#39;s a few chapters at most. Wanting something that it&#39;s more central theme. What is love to see is further exploration of things alluded to in Library at Mt Char. But unfortunately that&#39;s not happening. Please no YA, romantasy, or Dark Tower.
