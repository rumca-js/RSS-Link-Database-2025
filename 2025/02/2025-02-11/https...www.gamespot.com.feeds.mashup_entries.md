<p>In 2013, John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-resigns/1100-6405525/">stepped down as EA's CEO</a> following a tumultuous six-year run on top of the company.

<p>According to Activision founder Bobby Kotick, Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger was at one point in time interested in buying Nintendo, or at least interested in exploring the idea of buying Nintendo.</p><p>Kotick said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MN7nJdijzjfcP232NsHZF?si=mHGPjwjXQMiFbuZZEWcgqA">Grit podcast</a> that Munger was not a fan of video games, but saw an opportunity to potentially make a bid for Nintendo. Munger is said to have floated the idea of spending some of Berkshire's immense holdings on making moves in the video game space. One of Munger's ideas, apparently, was to buy Nintendo.</p><p>"He goes, 'You know, I was looking at a couple other companies in your sector. I think if we bought yours, we should buy that company Nintendo, too,'" Kotick recalled. "He said, 'Have you guys looked at it? I was like, 'Yeah.' It was trading [at the time] at like 13 billion, with 7 billion in cash. He goes, 'You know, I don't think anything is gonna go really

<p>One of the first and longest-running MMORPGs ever made, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tibia/">Tibia</a>, will receive a new class for the first time ever in its almost 30-year history, developer CipSoft has announced. The Monk class will join Tibia's four original classes--Sorcerer, Paladin, Druid, and Knight--which launched alongside the top-down 2D MMO in 1997.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed in a <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=8214">blog post</a> and teaser video, the Monk will be a melee fighter that can also provide a support role by healing allies. CipSoft said the Monk can be "played in a very special way" but wanted to make sure it fit seamlessly into the world of Tibia and existed in harmony with the game's existing four classes. The team also knew it wanted to introduce a new melee class that could also heal, but didn't want it to encroach on secondary roles like debuffing filled by Paladin and Sorcerers.</p><div data-embed-type="v

<p>Although Activision Blizzard is now owned by Microsoft's gaming division, its rise to become one of the top video game publishers was inadvertently helped by EA's decision to turn down opportunities that could have been transformative.

<p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said that Activision offered world-famous skateboarder Tony Hawk $300k to lend his name and likeness to the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game--an offer that came at a low point for him financially.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick claimed that Hawk was living in his car at the time, going through his second divorce. Kotick said that Hawk was desperate for money, so they signed him up with an additional 1.5% royalty rate that they renegotiated further as time went on.</p><p>"We made Pro Skater, did well, but Pro Skater 2, that was an awesome game. And that was the explosion of the business in some ways," Kotick explained.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p dir="ltr">Compulsion Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/south-of-midnight/">South of Midnight</a> seems to be exactly what I expected: an action-adventure game featuring platforming and combat that feels reminiscent of the genre during the PlayStation 2 era. Having now played the game for about 90 minutes, the gameplay doesn't wow me. That said, South of Midnight doesn't feel like a game that needs to deliver a never-before-seen gameplay experience. The focal point of the game is clearly its celebration of the myths, sounds, culture, and language of the American South, and in that respect, South of Midnight feels like it's going to exceed those expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as Hazel in South of Midnight, desperate to find her mother after their home washes away in a hurricane. Early into her journey, she learns to be a weaver, a person who can both unravel the corrupting forces influencing a community and knit together constructs to glide or leap across danger

Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/">immediately responded</a> with how much they hated it causing NetEase to backpedal within hours.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Civilization VII</a> developer Firaxis has released a new patch for the turn-based strategy game on PC, tweaking the gameplay, AI opponents, and the user interface. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-quality-of-life-fixes-are-inbound-starting-with-its-ui/1100-6529313/">This is one of several patches that Firaxis will roll out</a> as it continues to fine-tune Civilization VII. Firaxis did note that cross-play multiplayer has been temporarily disabled so that it can "expedite" deployment of the patch, but console players looking to cross-play against other console users should remain unaffected.</p><p>For the changes to the UI, Firaxis says the patch will fix issues that resulted in several bugs, like missing text, portraits not showing up under leaders, and menus failing to open. Other tweaks here include adding a notification for when espionage actions have been completed and general impro

<p>When you think of Transylvania, the first monster that comes to mind is probably a vampire like Count Dracula. Or perhaps even a werewolf. But in the upcoming co-op asymmetrical horror game Deadly Quiet, we're not quite sure what to make of the creatures living in Transylvania's Hoia Baciu forest. As seen in the game's first trailer below, these monsters have humanoid bodies and animal-like heads--including antlers. They also carry around multiple human skulls, if you want a preview of what your character's fate will be if you can't escape.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYJ9blmeFy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XYJ9blmeFy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>While Deadly Quiet is a first-person game, players aren't looking through the eyes of their characters.
