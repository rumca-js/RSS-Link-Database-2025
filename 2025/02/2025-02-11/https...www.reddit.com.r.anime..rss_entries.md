<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So as the title suggests, I’ve seen a good chunk of anime and particularly love these amazing female characters like Rose from Wwtuhm and Mereoleona from black clover.. but I’d like a anime where say.. usato had grown up fully and got with rose and they became the best healers with a strong and crazy love story intertwined lol .. (not saying I’d like to change these plots or anything) but if anyone has any recommendations for a anime where the ML gets with a FL like rose or mereoleona I’d really appreciate it</p> <p>(Harems are fine but I’m more so looking for a 1 on 1.. I understand there’s slim pickings so I’m not gonna be too picky.. only thing I can’t really stand, is when the mc is a wuss or weak/powerless and relies on everyone else (love shield hero tho so yk what I mean))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yolo_cholo1"> /u/yolo_cholo1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently finished watching Violet Evergarden (the series, the special, and both movies) and Maquia: When the promised flower blooms, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a good anime (be it movie or series) that is similar to those two. Heck even manga as well. I’ve been reading both Frieren (which I started reading after finishing the current season) and witch hat atelier.</p> <p>I’m fairly new to this space because I used to be a big hater of anime, but after watching and then reading (continuing) One Piece, I decided to start watching more anime and manga, and to even expand into other genres in the same medium. Hence how I ended up watching Violet and Maquia. Any recommendation is welcome, thanks. 👍🏼</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlienPixelMartArcade"> /u/AlienPixelMartArcade </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1immhki/any_good_anime_recommendations/">[link
