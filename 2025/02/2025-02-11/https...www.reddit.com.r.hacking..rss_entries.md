<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My school recently changed its wifi password and only allowed school issued laptops to connect much to the annoyance of everyone with a personal laptop or phone previously connected. Using netsh wlan show profile name=“” key = clear, I figured out what I thought to be the password but then found out it was encrypted. The encryption method was either WPA2Personal or WPA3. It seems very difficult to decrypt this. In order to run command as administrator and see the unencrypted password, I need an admin username and password. Is there anything I can do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drmobe"> /u/drmobe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1in2xqy/figuring_out_wifi_password/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1in2xqy/figuring_out_wifi_password/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In my Google map, I have my location history from 2-3 months ago, for example, where I went on specific dates, but I am not able to see someone else&#39;s history. How should I know who visited a particular shop with me on that particular day? Is Google Maps going to be helpful or are there other techniques I need to employ?
