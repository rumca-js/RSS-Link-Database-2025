<p>Dang it, OLED monitors, stop tempting me with lower prices. I can’t resist those vibrant colors and perfect black levels forever!</p>



<p>Take today’s deal, for example: a brand-new Acer Predator 27-inch OLED for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Predator-Monitor-FreeSync-Premium-1000nits/dp/B0C9L9MQF3/">a new low price of just $499.99</a>. That’s $100 less than last month, and half off the original price. How can any frugal PC gamer refuse?!</p>



<p>The Acer Predator X27U is a 2560×1440 display with a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.01ms response time, ideal for esports play on a gaming desktop. But it gets along great with gaming laptops, too, thanks to a USB-C connection with 90 watts of charging, plus the usual HDMI and DisplayPort options.</p>



<p>Don’t forget to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000722/best-monitor-arms.html">pick up a VESA moni

<p>Microsoft’s biggest apps — Word, Excel, and the rest in the Office suite — have all had spell checking for a long time now. But one notable app from which it was chronically missing? Notepad!</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2052273/rip-microsoft-wordpad-windows-95-30-years.html">WordPad was killed last year</a>, Microsoft paid a <em>little</em> bit of attention to Notepad by <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2388640/wordpad-is-dead-but-notepad-finally-has-spell-check.html">finally giving it a spell check feature</a>. If you’re still using Notepad in 2025, you should consider turning it on now that it’s available. You never know when a typo can slip past you.</p>

<p>How fast can you assemble a PC? I’ve seen The Full Nerd crew do <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2374276/watch-pcworld-build-a-pair-of-sff-video-production-pcs.html">two pretty hairy SFF builds in three hours</a>, and I don’t think I’ve ever done one in less than four. But Newegg found some speed demons at MegaCon Orlando over the weekend. The fastest time, according to Newegg’s social media? Just 4 minutes and a hair under 10 seconds.</p>



<p>“Alan H” scored the win, along with a $1,000 Newegg gift card, an Intel Core 7 Ultra processor, and a new B580 graphics card. <a href="https://x.com/Newegg/status/1888810377942540458">Other runner-up winners</a> were almost as fast at 4:18, 5:20, and 6:07.</p>

<p>When my 12-year-old daughter plunks onto the sofa for TV time, she might dial up Netflix to binge-watch <em>Gossip Girl</em> or switch on the PS5 for a little <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>. But when she <em>really </em>wants to veg out, she goes for YouTube. </p>



<p>After dinner, during those precious minutes when Mom and Dad are still doing the dishes, our teen will reliably have the Siri Remote in her fist, thumb down on the voice input button for some big-screen YouTube searches. </p>

<p>It’s a bad time to be in the market for… well, pretty much anything, if you’re an American. The Trump administration’s tariffs on China are driving up prices on basically all goods, but electronics are being hit especially hard. While buyers have enjoyed plunging prices on monitors for the last few years, display makers are now reportedly stockpiling to try and keep the prices from rising too high.</p>



<p>That’s according to a report from <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250207PD220/monitor-capacity-tariff-panel-cost.html">DigiTimes Asia</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/trump-tariffs-reportedly-spark-display-panel-stockpiling-from-monitor-manufacturers">Tom’s Hardware</a>), which says that big manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Samsung are importing 2 to 3 million units as a buffer against increasing prices.

<p>Nvidia’s latest graphics cards <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">sold out almost immediately</a>, which means tons of people are still clamoring to get their hands on one. But with recent issues rearing their heads, you might want to hold off.</p>



<p>Last week, RTX 5090 cards started <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2597674/rtx-5090-and-5080-cards-are-dying-likely-due-to-recent-driver-update.html">dying after Nvidia’s driver update</a>.

<p>Good luck if you’re trying to find one of Nvidia’s latest graphics cards. Retailers are so low on stock that they <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2596318/new-rtx-5090s-could-take-3-to-16-weeks-to-arrive.html">might be waiting months</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2599209/ebay-newest-nvidia-gpu-scams-are-even-dumber-than-before.html">even the eBay scammers</a> are getting metatextual. But if you’re okay with a less powerful model, at least one online store says that the RTX 5070 Ti should be arriving on February 20th. Get your camping gear ready, I suppose. </p>

<p>The 27-inch model in Samsung’s gorgeous Odyssey OLED G6 monitor line just dropped to a brand-new best price. If you’ve been waiting for a solid OLED deal, here it is: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-QD-OLED-FreeSync-Premium/dp/B0DHJD894W/">get the OLED G6 for $550 on Amazon</a>. That’s a 31 percent discount off its regular $800 price.</p>



<p>This is a pretty standard-sized display, but it packs a QD-OLED panel that delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and fantastic contrast. And with its 2560×1440 resolution, all the movies and TV shows you watch on this thing will be downright beautiful.</p>



<p>But this monitor is especially great for gamers, packing a 240Hz refresh rate that’ll ensure smooth visuals with your action-heavy, high-frame-rate games. The 0.03ms response time is also nice, minimizing lag and giving you the upper hand in

<p>Some days, like today, I just can’t believe how cheap mini PCs have gotten. Right now, you can snag this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Windows-Display-Desktop-Bluetooth/dp/B0BQHBWPYX/">Acemagician AM06 Pro for just $249 on Amazon</a>, the best price we’ve ever seen for it. (That’s a Prime-only deal, but if you don’t have Prime, you can still score this special price by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">signing up for a free 30-day trial</a>.)</p>



<p>Cheap doesn’t mean trash, by the way. The AM06 Pro runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. That’s a more-than-decent config that can handle productivity tasks, web browsing, media streaming, all while booting up your system in a jiffy and storing all your apps, photos, videos, and games with ease. If you ever outgrow it, it can be upgraded to 64GB of

<p>Buying an expensive, “fast” USB cable only to find that it chugs along like a steam train when transferring data can be highly disappointing. On the other hand, cheaper USB cables that deliver faster-than-expected data transfer speeds can be a welcome surprise.</p>



<p>Alas, it’s true that the data transfer speeds that are promised aren’t always what you get from your USB cables when all is said and done. There are a few reasons for that, some of which aren’t any fault of your cable, which I will touch on later.</p>



<p>Aside from that, though, you can use a simple manual calculation to determine your USB cable’s data transfer speed. With this technique you can at least get a snapshot of what your USB cables are capable of so that you know which ones to buy again and which ones to avoid.</p>

<p>The thought that somewhere out there, there’s a James Bond-like villain in an armchair stroking a cat and using generative AI to hack your PC may seem like fantasy but, quite frankly, it’s not. Cyber security experts are already scrambling to thwart millions of threats by hackers that have used generative AI to hack PCs, steal money, credentials, and data, and, with the rapid proliferation of new and improved AI tools, it’s only going to get worse.</p>
