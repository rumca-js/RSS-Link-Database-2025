Researchers discovered cut marks and skull fractures that indicate scalping, defleshing, and brain extraction. The findings suggest the practice was tied to warfare rather than survival, with human remains found alongside butchered animal bones. The study aligns with similar evidence from other European sites, indicating cannibalism may have been a significant cultural practice in the Magdalenian period.",

The study estimates these ridges formed within the last 160 million years, challenging the belief that lunar activity ended billions of years ago. Scientists believe continued contraction could cause moonquakes, posing potential risks for future lunar missions. Lunar samples from China's Chang\u2019e 5 mission further support this theory, pointing to relatively recent volcanic activity.
