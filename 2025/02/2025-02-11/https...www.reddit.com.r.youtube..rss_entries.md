<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, Duckus is a YouTuber who helps track down predators online. YouTube apparently declined this guy&#39;s two strikes. One was for child safety, and where is any way, shape or form, any pose of child safety? He&#39;s basically doing everything in his power to help child safety. Then he got a second one, apparently for n*****y/s<em>\</em>****l content. Now, he blurs every bit of ny and s*****l content, and the reason his videos are able to be watched by people who fall under the age restriction is because he blurs out those things no person wants to see. The thing that makes this even worse is the fact that YouTube declined his appeals, and they are still on the channel. This is kind of a wonder for me. Is YouTube really trying to take this guy down to keep predators safe? Is this why EDP445 is still on the platform? Is this why we still got YouTubers roaming on the platform that have had things going on with people under the age of consent?</p> </di
