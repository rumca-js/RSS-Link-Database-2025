<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W went on sale on November 25, 2024 - two and a half months ago. I just picked one up and I&#39;m eager to dig in and experiment with it, but I&#39;ve encountered a strange problem: the Raspberry Pi Foundation has not published any release-grade firmware for the Pico 2 W.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html">Raspberry Pi Foundation page for Pico firmware</a> contains direct links to four firmware files. The ones for the Pico, Pico W, and Pico 2 are device-specific binaries - but the one for the Pico 2 W links to &quot;mp_firmware_unofficial_latest.uf2,&quot; which is neither device-specific nor release-grade.</p> <p>The <a href="https://micropython.org/download/">MicroPython firmware repository</a> includes pages for a whole cast of MicroPython-grade devices. It also features <a href="https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO2_W/">a page for the Pico 2 W</a>, but that

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, yesterday i started playing with my raspberrypi, connected thru ssh to my laptop and started coding, today i wake up and tried to connect and cant... Cant connect thru vscode or cmd, but i can ping it, with the ip or with the host name, i tried a lot of things but cant make anything of it... Im really frustrated. When i try to connect thru vscode it takes a while and then it says it timed out, in the cmd the same thing. Ask me for more info if needed i can add prints etc. Ps: its a raspberrypi 400, i dont have an hdmi adapter yet so i cant connect it to a monitor, tho, i dont think the problem is in the pi because i could use it yesterday without a problem.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To put it simply i have 2 stepper motors hooked up to the esp32 that i want to control from the pi via uart when i ssh into the pi and run a python program which checks for the keystrokes from my laptop(from my laptop i am sshing into the pi and i want the pi to capture the keystrokes and write to the serial accordingly) and writes to the serial which is read by the esp32 and moves the motor accordingly</p> <p>Problem : 1.when i do this using windows(the esp32 is directly connected to my computer via the usb port COM5(windows)) the motors just work fine</p> <p>2.The same thing when it is done using raspberry pi where i ssh into the pi and run the script the motor rotates slowly or does not even care to rotate</p> <p>Assumptions (ig i am wrong here):</p> <p>1.the keystrokes idea via ssh is slowing things down ?</p> <p>2.The power for esp32 is low &gt; since i am connecting the esp32 to the pi via usb32 and the pi is powered by a 5v 3A supply ?</p> <p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I put together a simple Pi5 with a fan case and external hard drives powered separately on the USB3 port. My problem is that when I shutdown the Pi, the power from the external drives seems to fire up the fan (which is plugged in to the normal fan port). Any suggestions on how to stop this as I want to shutdown/startup the pi automatically on a time basis using cron etc and don&#39;t really need to have the fan running for no reason. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/btimmins42"> /u/btimmins42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1imuztc/pi_5_fan_shutdown_issue/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1imuztc/pi_5_fan_shutdown_issue/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see anyone talking about this so I wanted to post my findings after lots of testing and research. I think most people would say not to bother or that it was pointless to try but the results were surprising! I used a rpi zero 2w as my device. I tested with bullseye 32 and 64 bit, bookworm 32 and 64 bit, and buster 32 bit images. My process was to install and update, then install pi-apps and mesa-utils. Using pi apps I installed box 86, 64, wine, or hangover. </p> <p>Results: the best results were achieved in Bullseye 32bit with a 2-1 split kernel, full kms 3d driver and 2gb swap using mostly opengl games running between 640x480 and 1024x768. The games were actually very playable. xinput also worked on games that supported it.</p> <p>Linux games: Risk of rain, Hotline Miami, Sword &amp; Sorcery Bros, Kentucky Route Zero, thomas was alone (very slow in levels with water but otherwise ran well)</p> <p>Wine games: Star trek voyager elite force
