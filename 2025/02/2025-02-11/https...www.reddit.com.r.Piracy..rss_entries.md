<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently, I have a mac, and I want to screen record streaming sites to create custom content. However, nothing let&#39;s me get past the DRM. I&#39;ve disabled the hardware acceleration, I have OBS, but every streaming site gives the typical black screen. So my question is thus. Would I be better off using pirated streaming sites(and if so, could someone walk me thru that, im a dunce), or would I better off buying a pc laptop and finding some other way? It seems so simple and I feel like a right dipshit</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RobertPeruvian"> /u/RobertPeruvian </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1inbyy1/screen_record_mac_or_buy_pc_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1inbyy1/screen_record_mac_or_buy_pc_laptop/">[comments]</a></span>
