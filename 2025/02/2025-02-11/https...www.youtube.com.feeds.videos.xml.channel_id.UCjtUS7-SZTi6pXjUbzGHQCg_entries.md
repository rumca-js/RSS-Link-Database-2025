Why Does AI Need Nuclear Power? Get $200 off a Roborock Soros 10 until February 16th at https://amzn.to/3CNzZQP & https://bit.ly/3CH2pMm. As the new wave of generative AI scales up, so does its hunger for energy. Data centers are expanding at an unprecedented rate, putting immense strain on power grids and worsening years-long backlogs for electrical connections. With AI adoption accelerating across industries, big tech companies are tapping nuclear power as an alternative low-emissions energy source — going so far as to revive a dormant nuclear plant and bet big on new, compact reactors to secure their power supply. While nuclear energy is clean, its history is far from spotless. Have technological advances made it safer and more practical? And can these nuclear solutions arrive fast enough to power the future of AI?
