<p>This deeply moving film follows the maximum-security detainees training to run a marathon. It’s a troubling portrait of masculinity, but one which offers hope</p><p>Christine Yoo’s intelligent, compassionate and deeply moving film, 26.2 to Life: Inside the San Quentin Prison Marathon, follows some of the inmates of the California maximum-security facility. The men, most of whom are serving life sentences, are preparing to run 100-odd laps of the heavily guarded prison yard, along a barely marked track, weaving in and out of prisoners who do not know or care to stay out of their way. All of them are subject at any time to a minor or major lockdown that will interrupt or even cancel the race for which they have trained all year. They can wear non-prison-issue clothes to run in, but their shoes are the property of the state and have to be booked in and out by each man at every session.</p><p>The 1000 Mile Club, as the runners are known, are trained by a group of volunteers led by Fra

## Real Madrid’s Bellingham settles thriller to leave Manchester City on ropes

<p></p><p>Pep Guardiola had made the point that it was “impossible” to control Real Madrid’s fab front four. One of them will always get you, the Manchester City manager suggested. Here, it was not one but two of them who did so as Madrid built a precious first-leg advantage in this Champions League playoff. First it was Kylian Mbappé, who equalised for 1-1 with a streaky effort on the hour. And then, after Brahim Díaz – on as a substitute to face his former club – had found a second equaliser towards the end, the scene was set for another hero.</p><p>Carlo Ancelotti might have said the same thing about Erling Haaland. The City striker had a point to prove after drawing blanks in all four of his previous Champions League ties against Madrid. He proved it, scoring twice, the second from the penalty spot after Dani Ceballos had fouled the City substitute, Phil Foden. Haaland looked like being the headline act.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/11/manchester-cit

<p>The government should not stand aloof as a crisis unfolds in our universities. A new settlement is needed</p><p>In one of David Lodge’s famous campus novels, a young English literature lecturer pictures her university as “the ideal human community, where … people were free to pursue excellence and self‑fulfilment, each according to their own rhythm and inclination”.

But the marketised reality for modern university staff, particularly those at&nbsp;the sharp end of a deepening funding crisis, is another world altogether.</p>

<p>The encrypted messaging service is popular for work and play. But as Andrew Gwynne and many others have discovered: beware the leaks</p><p>There’s a familiar pattern in Westminster these days. An MP writes in haste a message to colleagues on WhatsApp. The contents leak to the press. Then there’s embarrassment, a public ticking off or – if really bad – the sack. The Labour MP Andrew Gwynne is the latest to experience this. Keir Starmer’s health minister was sacked and had the whip suspended after the Mail on Sunday <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14375823/Labour-minister-SACKED-vile-jibe-saying-hopes-pensioners-dont-vote-party-die-election-expose-racist-sexist-messages.html">revealed a secret WhatsApp group</a> by the name of “Trigger me Timbers”.</p><p>In messages published by the Mail, Gwynne is alleged to have penned a “joke” reply to a 72-year-old-constituent that read: “Dear resident, Fuck your bins.

<p>A Japanese man journeys to the Lake District to honour his late wife, testing his relationship with his son in the process</p><p>The curse of Beatrix Potter-associated cinema – from the lamentable Peter Rabbit films to the merely dismal Miss Potter – is lifted, at least temporarily, by the debut feature from Patrick Dickinson, even if his picture’s relationship to Potter’s work is purely tangential.</p><p>It was as a child on holiday in Windermere in the 1960s that Akiko (Tae Kimura) was first enchanted by the author’s stories. After her death from Alzheimer’s, her husband, the novelist and teacher Kenzaburo (Lily Franky), is given a letter written in the early stages of her diagnosis in which she asks him to travel from Tokyo to the Lake District to scatter her ashes in that cherished location.

Wanting fervently to be useful, in the next weeks and months she worked in a humanitarian warehouse in Lviv, found vital medicines for those who needed them, and helped to evacuate both civilians and their pets from the most dangerous corners of the country. Most significantly of all, she volunteered as a war crimes researcher, training with a Kyiv-based NGO called <a href="https://truth-hounds.org/en/homepage/">Truth Hounds</a>.</p><p>If such work was horrifying, it was also inspirational.

<p>When details about a scientific study in the 1960s became public, there was shock, outrage and anxiety. But exactly what happened?</p><p>In 2019, Shahnaz Akhter, a postdoctoral researcher at Warwick University, was chatting to her sister, who mentioned a documentary that had aired on Channel 4 in the mid-1990s. It was about human radiation experiments, including one that had taken place in 1969 in Coventry. As part of an experiment on iron absorption, 21 Indian women had been fed chapatis baked with radioactive isotopes, apparently without their consent.</p><p>Having grown up in Coventry’s tight-knit South Asian community, Akhter was shocked that she had never heard of the experiment. When she looked into it, she found an inquiry by the Coventry Health Authority in 1995 conducted soon after the documentary aired. The inquiry examined whether the experiment put the subjects’ health at risk and whether informed consent was obtained. But the only mention of the women’s perspectives w

<p><strong>Ashmolean Museum, Oxford<br></strong>From shocking images of him Sieg Heil-ing to a woodland watercolour haunted by the atrocities of war, the German artist confronts his homeland’s fascist past – and it’s never felt so relevant</p><p>When he was 24, Anselm Kiefer found his father’s old Wehrmacht uniform in the attic. This hidden, shameful family history was almost lost to time, almost forgotten, but Kiefer couldn’t let that happen. So he put on the overcoat and “Sieg Heil”-ed all across Europe, taking pictures along the way. This early art project in the late-1960s was the German artist attempting to embody and confront the past.</p><p>A picture of him doing the banned salute – forbidden in Germany under the long process of denazification – is at the heart of this show of his early works. He stands, arm raised, against a barbed-wire fence in shimmering, solarised black and white. It’s a ghostly and quiet photo, but amazingly powerful in its simplicity. That overcoat becam
