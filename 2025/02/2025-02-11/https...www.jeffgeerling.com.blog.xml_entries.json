With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux\u2014and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff Geerling</span></span>\n<span class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Febr",
