<p>For tech-heads, Framework’s modular laptop designs are some of the most exciting out there, offering the kind of desktop-style flexibility and upgrade options we’ve been craving for decades.

<p>The thought that somewhere out there, there’s a James Bond-like villain in an armchair stroking a cat and using generative AI to hack your PC may seem like fantasy but, quite frankly, it’s not. Cyber security experts are already scrambling to thwart millions of threats by hackers that have used generative AI to hack PCs, steal money, credentials, and data, and, with the rapid proliferation of new and improved AI tools, it’s only going to get worse.</p>
