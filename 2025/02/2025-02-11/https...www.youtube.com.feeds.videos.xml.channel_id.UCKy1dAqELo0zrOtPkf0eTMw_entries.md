However, the merciless rules of XG treat people's lives like toys, plunging the citizens of Neo Tokyo into horrifying situations.

To rebel against Zero's control, a group of teenagers have formed a resistance organization.

Armed with techniques and gear from their beloved "XB (Extreme Baseball)," they bravely engage in fierce battles alongside friends, overcoming any obstacles to reclaim their stolen dreams and freedom.

Premiering last year at the Fantasia Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best Canadian Feature, this sci-fi thriller tells the story of Theodore, a terminally ill convict serving out a life sentence alone on a silent planet. With every passing day his memories of earth become foggier. When a new prisoner, Niyya, arrives, he is excited to have a companion, but she just wants to be left alone. His persistence eventually wins her over until a foggy memory comes back to him – he thinks his real name may be Nathan Flanagan. This is the name of the rogue soldier who killed Niyya’s family when she was a child. If he is the same man, he seems to have completely lost his memory of this event. 

As she pushes him to remember what he did, he believes that she is messing with his head for nefarious reasons. She believes there is a greater conspiracy that brought them together. As they both become increasingly paranoid, they decide that their only chance at survival is to kill the other

We spoke to long-time Geralt voice actor, Doug Cockle, about his journey all the way from the first The Witcher video game to his latest adventure as Netflix's Geralt in the animated movie, The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep. While Henry Cavill may be the most famous actor to have played Geralt of Rivia, he’s not the first name many will think of when discussing The Witcher. Certainly amongst the gaming community, Doug Cockle — the voice of Geralt in CD Projekt Red’s Witcher games series of critically acclaimed RPGs — is considered the original and ultimate white wolf. But the paths of Cavill and Cockle’s Geralts have now merged, with Cockle bringing his unmistakable voice to Netflix’s interpretation of the character in the new animated Netflix movie, The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep.
