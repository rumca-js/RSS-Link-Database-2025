I&#39;m a developer working on a PvP multiplayer title primarily for Quest audiences but I&#39;d also like to support PCVR.</p> <p>Recently, the developer that handles a large portion of our online features (friends, parties, authentication, etc.) let me know that Meta&#39;s PCVR platform development tools on Windows... <em>aren&#39;t great</em>. It seems like Meta isn\u2019t prioritizing PCVR anymore, and supporting it has become increasingly difficult. At this point, they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s really feasible to continue supporting PCVR on the Meta platform.</p> <p>That said, even though I know what&#39;s easier for us, I want to make the best decision for <strong>you</strong>, the players. So, I&#39;m here to gauge the interest in PCVR overall and see if Steam would make a suitable replacement or if Meta is what you prefer?</p> <p>Your input means a lot, and I really appreciate your time! Thanks for helping me shape the best experience possible",
