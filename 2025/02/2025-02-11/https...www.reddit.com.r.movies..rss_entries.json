I liked it so much, I just purchased it for my DVD/Blu-Ray collection. I&#39;m glad I decided to give it a try. As someone who liked but could never bring myself to buy a single Star Wars DVD, a Blade-Runner DVD, or a Back To The Future DVD, this movie felt like everything I was looking for in those films. The only movie I can think of that I own close to it is the first Matrix movie, and Terminator 2 which I could barely even bring myself to buy as well. I was surprised to have liked it more than Terminator 2, given all the praise that one gets, and I expected it to be similar to Terminator 2, which prevented me from wanting to watch it, but it turns out it being not too similar to Terminator 2 is what made me like it so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oreoghostboy\"> /u/Oreoghostboy </a> <br/> <spa",
