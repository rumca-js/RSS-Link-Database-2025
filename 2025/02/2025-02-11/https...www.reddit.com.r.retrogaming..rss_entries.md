<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a game I used to play when I was very young. I remember it was like an apocalypse game or something. I&#39;m not sure if it involved zombies or aliens. It must be from the 90s to 2007, though I&#39;m not certain, because my cousin was the one who downloaded all the games for me. The view was top-down, like League of Legends (where you look at your character from above). I remember desert environments and piles of bones. You could enter some mines or something similar, where you had to fight monsters. I remember barrels with fire, but I&#39;m not sure if they were in the same game, because I also remember those barrels being in a city setting. What do you think? It could even be older.</p> <p>I think it has a similar look to Diablo, but not sure if it could be the same. I&#39;ve looked at some people playing it and it seems familiar, but not fully..
