Now, I obviously don&#39;t trust that rust, so I&#39;m trying to move the image over to a CF card. However I&#39;ve run into a snag. I installed Win 32 Disk Imager and hooked the drive up to my laptop through an IDE USB adapter. However while Windows sees that a drive is attached, it isn&#39;t assigning it a drive letter (and no, Windows, you can&#39;t initialize the disk!) so I can&#39;t get Imager to back it up. Does anyone have any pointers?

I really like the idea of the a500 Mini but they&#39;re currently hard to find here in the US (and maybe elsewhere) . I know I could just run Amiga Forever or something like that on PC but I&#39;d really like a dedicated device so I could just boot up and play games and maybe try the paint apps and other creative software like it was a real computer, much like with the C64 Mini I have. I have a Pi 3 or 4 (I&#39;d have to dig it up and find out what model it is but I think its the 3. Would my current best bet be to set that up with Amibian or something similar? I could easily get a Amiga case for my Pi or even a 400/500 keyboard Pi to stick with the all in one computer theme but I am clueless as to what to run on it for the most part. I could also pick up an old PC like an optiplex from the local computer ",
