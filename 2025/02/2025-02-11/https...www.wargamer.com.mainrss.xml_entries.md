								<p>A new narrative supplement for <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong>, Crusade: Nachmund Gauntlet, is packed with art and lore featuring Night Lords Chaos Space Marine units that either don’t have model kits, or have kits that are years out of date. It’s a tantalizing hint at what might be in the future for Chaos Space Marine releases - new jump troops, and updated Chaos drop pods.</p>

								<p>The <b>DnD Cleric 5e</b> is one of the most powerful and streamlined classes in Dungeons and Dragons. Often pigeonholed as an ‘armored support’ character or discounted as a tiresome, holy goody-two-shoes, the <b>5e Cleric</b> is actually one of the most versatile (and often powerful) options adventurers can pick. This guide explains all the key rules and build tips for a Dungeons and Dragons Cleric.</p>

								<p>The board wipe card Kozilek’s Return is the latest <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> price spike on our radar. This neat little Instant has gone up in price by 200% over just a couple of weeks. Priced at only $2.50 on January 26, the cheapest copies of this useful spell are now selling for $7.70, and it certainly seems like that price is only rising.</p>

								<p>The <strong>DnD</strong> Assassin subclass is a master of swift and decisive attacks, able to coat their weapons with poison so lethal it can ignore the poison resistance of their targets. That sounds equally edgy and awesome, until you realise that in the new Monster Manual, just six out of more than 500 monsters have poison resistance - and two of them are badgers.</p>
