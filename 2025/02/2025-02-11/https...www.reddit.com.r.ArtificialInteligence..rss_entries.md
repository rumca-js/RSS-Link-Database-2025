<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I don’t know much about AI or AI training, so I would like you to explain it to me as if I’m a 5yo. I just had a thought while watching anime. What if someone used all the anime available in the world to train a single video generation AI model? I’m not sure if that’s feasible or not it’s just an idea.</p> <p>For example, we know that anime piracy sites don’t manually download and upload every single anime; they use scripts or AI or something automated (I’m not fully knowledgeable about this). Similarly, imagine what a video generation AI model could do if it were trained on every single anime ever made.</p> <p>I don’t know if this idea is achievable or realistic, but I would really appreciate it if someone could explain the details to me. I’m looking forward to your response. I would love to know all the technicalities, Thank you! 😄</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/avgDrStonelover"> /u/avgDrS

Over the past year, I have started noticing a trend of AI-generated artists and songs, to differing degrees. And since late 2024, the number seemingly has skyrocketed.</p> <p>The one that has perhaps gained popularity the quickest as of recent is Aria Sai. A month ago, in early January 2025, this artist had under 30,000 Spotify Monthly Listeners. Today, in early February 2025, she has over 80,000.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Came across a powerful (and intuitive) way to detect Hallucinations in LLMs.</p> <p>As we&#39;ve been talking about for a long-time, Hallucinations are not a very useful term because it groups different types of errors into one. This method works for one of the most common types, confabulations- which are more random errors (as opposed to issues with bad data or an out of syllabus task).</p> <p>The idea is simple- if we can compute the uncertainty in the semantic space, we can identify generations where LLMs are unsure. The simplicity of this method ensures generalization and will work across- datasets and tasks without a priori knowledge of the task. As long the LLM has the requisite vocabulary, this method won&#39;t need task-specific data and will robustly generalize to completely unseen tasks.</p> <p>Taking a longer view of things, this tells me that the embedding layer is being underpriced right now.
