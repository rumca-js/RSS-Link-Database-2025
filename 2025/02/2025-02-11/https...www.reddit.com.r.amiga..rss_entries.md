He’s rated the games after 1 or 2 levels of each. He’s also asked if I can post the link here - so here it is - one shameless plug ❤️ - hope you enjoy it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bOingball-"> /u/bOingball- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://youtu.be/EBV7KdkTXuE">[link]</a></span> &#32; <s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently reclaimed my A1200 from my youth, and was *astonished* to see that the HDD booted straight up! Now, I obviously don&#39;t trust that rust, so I&#39;m trying to move the image over to a CF card. However I&#39;ve run into a snag. I installed Win 32 Disk Imager and hooked the drive up to my laptop through an IDE USB adapter. However while Windows sees that a drive is attached, it isn&#39;t assigning it a drive letter (and no, Windows, you can&#39;t initialize the disk!) so I can&#39;t get Imager to back it up. Does anyone have any pointers? I&#39;d hate for my copies of PPaint and PageStream to vanish into the ether!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RikF"> /u/RikF </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1in58yx/help_backing_up_my_history/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1in58yx/help_backing_up_my_history/">[co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just set up Emu68 on my PiStorm32 Lite 1200 and was making some changes to the startup-sequence when I rebooted the machine and now all I get is the Emu68 logo, it won&#39;t boot any further. All I added was a couple of assign statements. Is there any way to access the Amiga workbench partition on the sdcard to change the startup-sequence back so I can boot again? Thanks for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RunPsychological5595"> /u/RunPsychological5595 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1in1mzp/pistorm32_lite_help_accessing_amiga_files_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1in1mzp/pistorm32_lite_help_accessing_amiga_files_on/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been fascinated by Amiga era games for a while and would like a device set up to play emulated games as a real amiga is out of the question. I really like the idea of the a500 Mini but they&#39;re currently hard to find here in the US (and maybe elsewhere) . I know I could just run Amiga Forever or something like that on PC but I&#39;d really like a dedicated device so I could just boot up and play games and maybe try the paint apps and other creative software like it was a real computer, much like with the C64 Mini I have. I have a Pi 3 or 4 (I&#39;d have to dig it up and find out what model it is but I think its the 3. Would my current best bet be to set that up with Amibian or something similar? I could easily get a Amiga case for my Pi or even a 400/500 keyboard Pi to stick with the all in one computer theme but I am clueless as to what to run on it for the most part. I could also pick up an old PC like an optiplex from the local computer

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got an Amiga 500+ that has been re-capped a month ago and it was working when I tested it briefly. I took it out again to play with it yesterday and it showed a black screen.</p> <p>I see Dr Chris performed some ninja kung foo on a recent Amiga 500+ repair (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGvGWL9Zm4k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGvGWL9Zm4k</a>) but I dont have the experience, tools or skills to do this.</p> <p>What are some basic trouble shooting I can do to determine what the issue could be ? Hopefully it is not a big issue, else I will have to find someone to help me repair it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pheoniverse"> /u/pheoniverse </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1imtfk1/amiga_500_black_screen/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1imtfk1/amiga_500_black_screen/">[comments]</a></span>
