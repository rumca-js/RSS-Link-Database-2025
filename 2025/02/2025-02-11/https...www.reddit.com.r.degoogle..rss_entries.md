<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I know there is plenty of email services out there for us that are relatively private and not a shit company. How do you suggest moving email services? I use a personal gmail account for everything including my banking, DMV, etc. Did you just have to remember all of them and change the email to a new service? Seems like a pain in the ass.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itspxris"> /u/itspxris </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1incc6v/advice_on_degoogling_email/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1incc6v/advice_on_degoogling_email/">[comments]</a></span>

It&#39;s basically a comprehensive list of alternatives to Google search, maps, storage, cloud, translate, etc.</p> <p>It&#39;s also lists alternatives to Amazon, NordVPN, Microsoft, WhatsApp, and so on.</p> <p>Some things will be separated like Google Search and Yandex, but the alternatives are the same. Each alternative is also described so you can get some info and go from there.</p> <p>It&#39;s been really useful in my deeverythinging so I hope it helps!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tamjas"> /

No longer working for a cell phone company I am far more hesitant to attempt root access on my s24 as phones cost me money these days. </p> <p>Does anyone have any solid guides to swapping os on newer Samsung devices?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ILLfated28"> /u/ILLfated28 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1in78ry/how_to_start_degoogling_s24_ultra/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1in78ry/how_to_start_degoogling_s24_ultra/">[comments]</a></span>
