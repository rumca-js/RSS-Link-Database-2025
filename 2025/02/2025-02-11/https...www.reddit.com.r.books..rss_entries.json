I had many questions after the book, so I watched some video overviews, read other people\u2019s Reddit posts, and I get the whole philosophical main dilemma of the book. However, there are a few things I wanted to bring up or ask about that it doesn\u2019t seem anyone is talking about.</p> <p>First thing is at the end of the chapter titled the thinkers, Kelvin is talking about his own doctoral project regarding electrical charges on the surface of solaris which were somewhat analogous to electrical processes in humans that have to do with emotions such as depression and whatnot.

It&#39;s not really the supernatural scenes that stick out, but the ones that may or may not be natural that are. Seeing the characters twist against each other, Eleanor growing both contemptuous and dependent on her company at Hill House. We don&#39;t know if we are seeing visions of increasingly callous remarks, or if the million wrong angles Hugh Crain has drawn up all compound on them until their behavior becomes impossible to understand. Eleanor is probably the closest I&#39;ve gotten to getting stuck in a characters head, and for better or worse, the ending really releases you out of it. Shirley Jackson is above all of this a really great writer and is able to almost cut off her characters with the narration.
