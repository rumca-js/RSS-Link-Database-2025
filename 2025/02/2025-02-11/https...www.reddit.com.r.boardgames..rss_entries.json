        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for this board game I played more than 10+ years ago at the Florida Rennisance Festival in the gaming forest area. It involved a wooden board with a 4x4 grid and 8 buddah statues set in an X shape on the grids. The colors were red and gold for the one they used. The goal of the game was to get your colored statue in one straight line, the opposite x diagonal, or in a 2x2 square pattern. You could only move the pieces in straight lines and not in diagonals from what I can remember. Please let me know if anyone has any ideas of what it could be called, or a board game equivalent to it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy5856\"> /u/Icy5856 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1impmr0/trying_to_find_the_name_of_an_old_board_game_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1impmr0/trying_to_find_the_name_of_an_",
