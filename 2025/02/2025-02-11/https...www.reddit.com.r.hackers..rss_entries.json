I read the terms of service and I think what I did wrong was remove a watermark from the page. I reuploaded the picture without the watermark to enhance it more and so they saw that I violated their terms of service. I won\u2019t be making that mistake again. </p> <p>Anyway, I tried a proxy and it opens but it doesn\u2019t let me register. What\u2019s the best thing I can do to have a new account? There is no contact information on the website.
