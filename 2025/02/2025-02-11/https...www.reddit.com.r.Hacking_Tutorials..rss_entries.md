<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, </p> <p>I&#39;ve been training Deepseek R1 to make it capable of efficiently hacking binary code, and I wanted to share a high-level blueprint of how I&#39;m doing it. </p> <p>For pointers, I&#39;m hosting it in an Air-gapped environment of 6 machines (Everything is funded by yours truly XD)</p> <p>At first I wanted to orient it around automating low-level code analysis and exploitation, I started with an outdated version of Windows 10 (x86 Assembly) a version which had multiple announced CVEs and I managed to train the model to successfully identify the vulnerabilities within minutes. The way I managed to do that is placing 1 of the machines as the target and the 6 others where intertwined and handling different tasks (e.g. static analysis, dynamic fuzzing, and exploit validation). </p> <p>After I saw success with x86 I decided to take things up a notch and start working on binary. I&#39;ve been feeding it malware samples, CTF challenge

How should I know who visited a particular shop with me on that particular day? Is Google Maps going to be helpful or are there other techniques I need to employ?
