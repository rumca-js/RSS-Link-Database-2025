## Born to heal: Why babies recover, but adults scar, after heart damage

Newborns with heart complications can rely on their newly developed immune systems to regenerate cardiac tissues, but adults aren't so lucky. After a heart attack, most adults struggle to regenerate healthy heart tissue, leading to scar-tissue buildup and, often, heart failure. A new study in experimental animals reveals a critical difference in how macrophages -- a part of the immune system -- help repair the heart in newborns versus adults after a heart attack. The study highlights a fundamental difference in how the immune system drives healing based on age.

## Mystery solved: New study reveals how DNA repair genes play a major role in Huntington's disease

A new study has discovered in mouse models that genes associated with repairing mismatched DNA are critical in eliciting damages to neurons that are most vulnerable in Huntington's disease and triggering downstream pathologies and motor impairment, shedding light on disease mechanisms and potential new ways to develop therapies.

## New perspectives for personalized therapy of brain tumors

Scientists have developed an innovative method for growing brain tumors of individual patients in the laboratory that mimic the original structure and the molecular property of the parental tumor as closely as possible. Drug tests in this model were found to correlate very well with actual patient responses, making it a valuable method for investigating therapies.

## 'Junk' RNA segments play role in protein production, cell stress response

Scientists have discovered that some tiny segments of RNA thought to be junk instead have a functional role in suppressing production of certain messenger RNAs and appear to help cells respond to oxidative stress.

## A wealth of evidence: 85,000 individual studies about climate policy
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250211134106.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250211134106.htm)

Research on climate policy is growing exponentially. Of the approximately 85,000 individual studies ever published on policy instruments for mitigating global heating, a good quarter are from 2020 or later. A study using machine learning methods now shows how this vast knowledge is distributed -- by instrument, country, sector and policy level -- and identifies research gaps. A corresponding web tool, the 'living systematic map', will help to guide science and policy. It will be continuously updated to reflect the current state of research.
