<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello people. I&#39;ve run into a obnoxious problem that plagues Nvidia laptops on Linux: GPU/CPU(?) under performance (see <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/has-anyone-been-able-to-run-an-rtx-3060-laptop-gpu-at-more-than-80w-on-linux/192959/109">this</a>, just one of the threads that covers it on the Nvidia forums). I&#39;m running Endeavour OS with the 6.13.2 kernel, Nvidia 570 drivers installed. Also, I&#39;m using tuned instead of power-profiles-daemon to manage power consumption (might be relevant). </p> <p>It seems that my system is unable to match the performance under Windows. On Linux, I get about 10-15 FPS less than on Win in Monster Hunter World, a very CPU bounded game. Enabling nvidia-powerd.service allowed the GPU to match the wattage under Windows when playing (it was capped to 55 W before, as its enabled by default), but it doesn&#39;t reflect on performance. </p> <p>For context, my laptop has 3 basic power modes that can

I think I may have installed too many games. I have a problem and I don&#39;t know which ones to uninstall. I don&#39;t like to uninstall games that I feel I may play at some point.
