I have always hates windows and i have used linux for a few years around covid. I love arch and pacman and yay and all that. The problem is that right now i want a nice looking but not bloated arch based distro. I have been hopping like crazy for the past two days. I feel like this happens to me every time. I somehow get overstimulated by it. I have OCD which makes it worse. So I installed vanilla arch with gnome to get the most minimal setup but then i didn\u2019t like the terminal and other customisation stuff so i installed kde and removed gnome but then i started getting lags and shit and whatnot. Now im thinking about endeavouros. Idk i just wanted to rant here. I feel like im stuck in a weird loop. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
