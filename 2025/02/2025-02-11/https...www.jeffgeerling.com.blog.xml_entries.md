            <p></p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linuxâ€”and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>
