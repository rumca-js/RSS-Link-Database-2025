<p>&quot;We’ll start day one with keynotes, followed by breakout sessions, workshops, demos, networking opportunities and more continuing on day two,&quot; Google said. In a separate email the company sent to Engadget, it promised to share updates on Gemini and Android, alongside new innovations related to web and cloud development.

<p>Securing your online footprint can seem like a daunting task. We’ve become accustomed to giving up bits of data for convenience, and have been forced into trusting our internet service providers because access has become so vital to everyday life. You don’t have to blindly accept this, though: using a virtual private network (VPN) can be an easy way to gain back some of your anonymity and security while browsing online. Still, it can be challenging to differentiate which service makes most sense for your online needs.<br><br>We tested nine of the most popular VPN services available now to come up with our top picks, and lay out what you should know before paying for one. Our top pick remains <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-13792482" data-original-link="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-13792482">ProtonVPN</a> thanks to its easy-to-use interface, no-logs policy and open-sour

<p>My hand is cramping. It’s not carpal tunnel or some other dubious reason that’s causing the pain. It’s an analog ache that is oddly satisfying in a nostalgic way.

<p>Kickstarter just unveiled a bunch of new tools for backers and creators. The most notable of the bunch is called Pledge Over Time and, well, it’s exactly what it sounds like. The tool allows backers to split a pledge into four payments that get pulled from a bank account every two weeks. It’s sort of like Affirm or Klarna.</p>
<p>This feature should also help creators, as it’ll entice more backers to buy into a campaign. It’s available right now, but only to select campaigns. Pledge Over Time is coming to everyone “by spring.” This follows a related tool that was released last year that allows folks to back projects <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/kickstarter-now-allows-late-pledges-after-a-campaign-has-ended-173414742.html">after a campaign has ended</a>.</p>

<p>Google Maps now officially shows the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America if you open the app in the US. In a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/">blog post</a>, Google said it rolled out the named change because the government has already <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730">updated</a> the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), which decides the &quot;federal and national standard for geographic nomenclature.&quot; One of the executive orders President Donald Trump signed in January when he took office renames the body of water, but Google <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-maps-will-rename-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america-but-only-for-us-users-043726929.html">previously explained</a> that it&#39;s the company&#39;s longstanding policy to wait for official government resources to be upda

<p>If you’re currently in the market for a music-streaming subscription, have we got a deal for you. Pick up <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://music.apple.com/listen-now?itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;itsct=skimlinks_music&amp;at=1001l3bo9&amp;p=subscribe-individual" data-original-link="https://music.apple.com/listen-now?itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;itsct=skimlinks_music&amp;at=1001l3bo9&amp;p=subscribe-individual">six months of Apple Music for just $3</a>. That’s not a typo. This discount brings the price down to, checks math, $0.50 per month. The cost is typically $11 per month, so today’s sale represents a savings of more than $60.</p>
<p>The usual caveats apply. This is an enticement to bring in new subscribers, so current members are out of luck (myself included.) It’s also not available for those who currently qualify for a three-month free trial of the service. Finally, this deal must be redeemed on an Apple device,

It’s a bid for the non-profit that controls OpenAI’s for-profit arm.</p>
<p>OpenAI is not a traditional company, and the non-profit structure Sam Altman and others at the company want it to get away from may, in fact, protect it from Musk’s offer.</p>
<p>There’s further drama around all this: Musk had sued OpenAI and Sam Altman for allegedly ditching its non-profit mission <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman-for-allegedly-ditching-non-profit-mission-160722736.html"><ins>around this time last year</ins></a>.</p>

<p>There’s no such thing as one “best” music streaming service. Most of these apps are designed around the same principles and provide access to a huge music catalog. Pretty much <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.headphonesty.com/2025/01/streaming-payouts-hit-new-low-artists-earn/">none of them</a> are paying artists properly, yet nearly all of them are steadily raising prices. If you’ve used one to build up a library over the years, that one is most likely to be in tune with your musical tastes.<br><br>That said, if you’ve grown tired of whatever service you use today, we’ve spent months getting to know all of the major music streamers, feeding them similar data and taking note of how they adapt to our preferences over time. While the broad strokes are similar with each, there are a few key differences in the margins that might sway you from one app to another. Below, we’ve highlighted the best music streaming services on the whole and broken down where they excel and fa
