<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I’ve been collecting warhammer for about 7-8 months now with my first ever proper kit being bought at the end of June. Since June, i’ve gathered quite a collection and im not sure what to do. </p> <p>Quick Timeline</p> <p>June-July: I bought my first ever kit from GW which was the ork combat patrol because i loved their style and aesthetic. Later whilst properly getting into the painting i realised its not all that easy to get my paint job like the cover arts and i lost some of the appeal for the orks as the box art is what i aimed to achieve. After trying to get through painting the combat patrol and eventually coming to a stop due to going on holiday etc, i decided that i was looking for more and as a result i bought the starter set for kill team as it had the kommandos and contained some cool extra krieg minis.</p> <p>August-September: Whilst i was trying my best to spray my minis with wraithbone (which typically went very poorly because

It makes me wonder if games workshop/black library would start reprinting the Horus heresy novels from the beginning again, slowly re releasing to get more of the new wave of fans into the lore even more. Making the books more accessible by reprinting a new book each month would definitely benefit the fans and games workshop honestly.</p> <p>It would definitely benefit everyone, It&#39;s more wishful thinking than expectations.
