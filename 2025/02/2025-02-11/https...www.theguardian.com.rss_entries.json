All of them are subject at any time to a minor or major lockdown that will interrupt or even cancel the race for which they have trained all year.

One of them will always get you, the Manchester City manager suggested. Here, it was not one but two of them who did so as Madrid built a precious first-leg advantage in this Champions League playoff. First it was Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who equalised for 1-1 with a streaky effort on the hour. And then, after Brahim D\u00edaz \u2013 on as a substitute to face his former club \u2013 had found a second equaliser towards the end, the scene was set for another hero.</p><p>Carlo Ancelotti might have said the same thing about Erling Haaland. The City striker had a point to prove after drawing blanks in all four of his previous Champions League ties against Madrid. He proved it, scoring twice, the second from the penalty spot after Dani Ceballos had fouled the City substitute, Phil Foden. Haaland looked like being the headline act.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/11/manchester-cit",
