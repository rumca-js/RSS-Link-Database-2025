<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is it just me or when you have a manager who delegates tasks after tasks without priorities or requirements, there’s more pressure on you as the individual. I often hear “you have to own it, run with it”…and then when you offer a solution or idea, it’s ignored or you’re told why should it matter. When you have a question or problem, you’re told to “just google it…” rather than the manager presenting their insights or thoughts. I’m the type to learn when seeing it myself or shadowing others, not getting stuck on a problem forever. I get it that sometimes, managers want to challenge you to get the most out of you…but the tradeoff can be getting burnt out. </p> <p>I tell myself everyday and every week to find a new job elsewhere, but is this how SecOps is everywhere else? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yo_heythere1"> /u/yo_heythere1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/

Apple has recently released Apple Intelligence which is turned on by default on iOS 18.3. </p> <p>I was hoping to get some feedback on the privacy/security implications for this feature. I understand that Apple has stated that the ML is done on the device end and personal data is not stored on their servers. However, there is also chatGPT with Siri integration which they state you have to explicitly opt out of sharing data with openAI at some point (which is unclear). </p> <p>The second matter is that Apple Intelligence as it stands now has the potential to highlight and promote phishing emails. Since it doesn&#39;t have the understanding of context in emails, it seems to prioritize any emails that sound urgent, which is most phishing emails (<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255960029?sortBy=rank">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255960029?sortBy=rank</a>). </p> <p>This combi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, new to the sec world. Company does not want to pay for Defender XDR and eventually Sentinel for testing purposes. I’ve used all my mobile numbers and cards to set up free trials. Planning on just getting Defender XDR and possibly Sentinel to set up a home environment lab. Have any of you guys done it? If yes, any advice? What is the most cost efficient way to do that?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/duuuuuuuudeimhigh"> /u/duuuuuuuudeimhigh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1imssj3/defender_xdr_home_lab/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1imssj3/defender_xdr_home_lab/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Are you trying to decide between SOC 2 and ISO 27001? SOC 2 is great for SaaS companies and service providers which it’s flexible and focuses on our customer trust, but it can feel a bit open-ended. So yeah, ISO 27001, on the other hand, is the “gold standard” for building a comprehensive security management system. It’s more rigorous and globally recognized, but it can be a heavier lift for our product.</p> <p>For startups or companies working with clients in the SOC 2 might be the better starting point. But if global credibility is a priority, ISO 27001 could be worth the effort./,</p> <p>What’s been your experience? Did you go for one or both? And if you’ve been through the process, what tools or strategies made it easier? Would love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MutedDraft4077"> /u/MutedDraft4077 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comment

## Is there no secure way to run LLMs on the cloud?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why does every enterprise always demand that LLMs used in their backend not be used on the cloud? Isn&#39;t there private clouds now? I thought we&#39;ve come a long way from having processing done in data centers far away to not be enterprise-level secure!</p> <p>What are the alternatives? Doing it all in your own datacenter or in a local server in the office basement? I just don&#39;t see why cloud is so frowned upon for cybersecurity when it&#39;s basically the only option (for enterprise).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the_rsktaker"> /u/the_rsktaker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1imqrza/is_there_no_secure_way_to_run_llms_on_the_cloud/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1imqrza/is_there_no_secure_way_to_run_llms_on_the_cloud/">[comments]</a></span>

## Vulnerability researcher vs code scanner

It seems like every new article I read, or video I watch, continues to push the narrative that the days of the technical mastermind are over and employers are only looking for the “jack of all trades”.
