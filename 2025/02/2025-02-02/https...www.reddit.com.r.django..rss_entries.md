<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m building a real estate platform on Django that will have over 1 million property listings. The data will be pulled from a CRM, but the client also wants the ability to manually add and edit listings, independent of the CRM.</p> <h1>What I need:</h1> <ul> <li>A single admin panel where the client can manage property listings, pages, blog, and menus in one place.</li> <li>A user-friendly interface (Django Admin is not an option â€“ too clunky and risky).</li> <li>SEO optimization (listings should be well-structured for search engines).</li> <li>Multilingual support (the site will be in multiple languages).</li> <li>PostgreSQL support for scalability.</li> </ul> <h1>The big question:</h1> <p>Would Wagtail be a good choice for managing both content and real estate listings? Or would it be better to <strong>use</strong> Wagtail for pages and blog, while handling listings separately in a custom-built admin panel?</p> <p>If anyone

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi. i need your advice... i have been learning django for a few months now. i knew the basics of python and someone recommended django so i dived into it. i am following a tutorial right now and i think i know the basics(CRUD, urls, templates, forms, users, admin, etc.) and know the path ahead of me. but suddenly i am feeling stressed, am i gonna find a job with it? i searched the web and i couldnt find jobs that only want django and now im in doubt and dont even know if i should continue down this path. what will happen when i finished the tutorial (try django 3.2 - cfe). so, what are the odds that i can make a living with django? should i learn other things alongside? if yes, what and when and how. i am getting demotivated by the very few jobs that i found online... i am very open to do freelancing and also can only work remotely as i live in Iran and cant travel abroad for a job untill i get really good at it and can be sure that i can make a livi

## Running Pydantic AI under Django

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to get Pydantic AI running under Django. It&#39;s a pet project so far so I&#39;m only using `runserver`. The first error I got what that the event loop wasn&#39;t running.</p> <p>&gt; RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread &#39;Thread-1 (process_request_thread)&#39;.</p> <p>I did a bit of reading and started splashing &quot;async def&quot; on my views and other functions in the stack. I also started using the async ORM verisons (e.g acreate instead of create). Then I changed how I was calling the Pydantic AI Agent (await <a href="http://agent.run">agent.run</a> instead of calling agent.run_sync) and this worked.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if there are other ways I could fix the issue. Specifically, I&#39;d want to avoid splashing async all over the place now if possible. I used a run_sync method from Pydantic AI to keep things simple. It complicates things for me. Any thoughts/ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am legit blown away. I&#39;ve been using Cursor lately and I don&#39;t think I can go back anymore. Especially when it comes to fullstack development. For those of you not using AI to level up your development I would highly recommend starting.</p> <p>backstory - I wanted to add a public playground section for my application which included a backend, frontend, and some internal integrations with my existing stuff and about 30 new files and 8k new lines of code later its working just how I want. The best part is it took me 1 day and just prompted the entire thing. Didn&#39;t write one bit of html for it. I&#39;ve been in software engineering for 8 years so I&#39;ve seen trends come and go but at this point I&#39;m 100% sold on this.</p> <p>This thing handles django templates with htmx so unbelievably well that I&#39;m convinced anyone can build something very impactful in very little time. </p> <p>Here&#39;s a video of the whole thing <a href="https
