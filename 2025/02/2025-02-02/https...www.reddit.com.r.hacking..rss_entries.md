<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working my way through the PNPT cert and on the web portion it covers the basics of XSS attacks (reflected, stored, DOM), then it shows you how to do a few examples. </p> <p>I&#39;m trying to build a methodology but it&#39;s a bit challenging. Most resources online either just tell you about XSS attacks and how to prevent them, how to solve very specific examples, or their methodologies are for more advanced situations beyond the scope of the course (i.e. filter and WAF bypassing). </p> <p>I have a decent understanding on how each type works, but when faced with a challenge, my mind blanks out on how or where to start. Any tips on this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/error_therror"> /u/error_therror </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ig6me5/whats_your_xss_methodology/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ig6m

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Someone I know claims they got bored and hacked into a university they were waiting around in. The security found them and talked to them. Over the course of the conversation, they laid out all their system&#39;s flaws, and the security offered them a job. They declined, since they don&#39;t live nearby but was planning to move soon, but they were told a job would be waiting for them when they eventually moved nearer. They say this is fairly common in this line of work.</p> <p>I think this is a bunch of BS. Here is my reasoning:</p> <ul> <li>They admitted to and were caught in the process of committing a crime, and were... offered a job? No company I know will hire you because they &quot;like your moxie&quot; cos you did something brave, like it&#39;s the 1950s.</li> <li>They declined the job and still got no reprimand for blatantly breaking the law? Surely the alternative to working for the uni is going to jail? Like you&#39;re clearly a threat to t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, </p> <p>Hope everyone&#39;s been well. Been away from this community for quite a while and really looking to get back on the horse- guess that happens to all of us with life and work, right? </p> <p>Anyway, as the title reads, I&#39;m looking to find some affordable VPS servers and proxies. something that takes crypto would be nice but is not necessary for this use case. </p> <p>For the proxies im sure the lists ive had previously are long dead. </p> <p>Just looking for an idea of what most of you are using now or how you all are finding things now.
