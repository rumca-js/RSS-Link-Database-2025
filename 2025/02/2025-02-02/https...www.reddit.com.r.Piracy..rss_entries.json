What I find is that switching devices is cumbersome, obviously the save game file is an issue to continue my progress. Could I somehow have the game save file the network and it be shared for easy access from either location? Could it sync somehow? I know I could copy and paste the file each time, but that&#39;s not practical. </p> <p>Another issue I have is that I have an Xbox controller I connect via Bluetooth. My current solution is to turn off Bluetooth on the computer I am not using, but that is also cumbersome. I don&#39;t suppose there is better way to handle this either right? </p> <p>I post in this subreddit because cloud syncing with many purchased games is the standard nowadays, so this isn&#39;t an issue. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bre",

Now I know, that I could just fix it by very legally downloading the newest version, but I live in a country where it is somewhat difficult to very legally download software, so I usually wait until I have traveled somewhere and then do it there.
