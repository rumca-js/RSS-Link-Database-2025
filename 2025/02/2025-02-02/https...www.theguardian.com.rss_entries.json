Do what you don\u2019t say. This philosophy of misdirection is one of the principles underlying this latest show from Gandini Juggling, a unique group that\u2019s been plying its trade for more than 30 years. They juggle, yes, but not in the way you\u2019d see at the circus. This is theatre, with a choreographer\u2019s eye for the arrangement of bodies, balls and hoops, and every show is a deep dive into a new idea. In Heka, it is the art of magic. The seven-strong cast, already adept at manipulating juggling props, have learnt some impressive sleight of hand. Balls appear and disappear; they\u2019re about to be tossed in the air then suddenly evaporate; they unexpectedly pop-up in someone\u2019s mou",
