Firearms Factory is about the forced conversion of your candy factory into an arms factory during the Second World War. While your purpose in life was once to bring joy to children, unfortunately you now find yourself on your way to becoming a supporter of the war. Your main goal is to produce weapons for your country and win the war.</p> <p>Firearms Factory is a mix of Tycoon, Strategy and Simulation genres. My biggest inspirations are Game Dev Tycoon, This War of Mine and Hearts of Iron IV. For now, I plan to add a campaign mode where you will play the story of discovering fission, but I also really want to create a sandbox version in the future.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Firearms Factory doesn&#39;t have a demo yet, but one will be available shortly. If you are interested in the theme, I would be very happy if you add it to your wishlist!</p> <p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/18089",
