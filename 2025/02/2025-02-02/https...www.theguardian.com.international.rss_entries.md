<p>Research into ‘dark personality traits’ has always focused on men. But some experts believe standard testing misses the ways an antisocial personality manifests itself in women</p><p>Picture a psychopath. Who do you see in your mind’s eye? Chances are it’s a man. And chances are your answer would be similar if you were asked to picture a narcissist. From Charles Manson and Ted Bundy to Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump, most famous people we consider psychopathic or narcissistic are male.

<p>Playing a raging but inwardly terrified housewife, the actor and a fine supporting case are the intense focus of a story that cries out for closure</p><p>Anyone who has ever heard the director Mike Leigh interviewed will know that he is not a man who is given to enthusiasm. He doesn’t effuse; rather he growls, a bristly, whiskery warning to the world to keep its distance. Listening to him, you could be forgiven for assuming that, with a career spanning more than half a century, seven Oscar nominations, a Cannes Palme d’Or (for <em>Secrets </em><em>&amp; Lies</em>) and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/13/film.venicefilmfestival2004">Venice Golden Lion</a> (for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jan/09/philipfrench">Vera Drake</a></em>), Leigh is not much of a fan of anything to do with the film industry. But then you watch one of his films – his latest, <em>Hard Truths</em>, for example – and it becomes clear that there is one passion that remains

As a major exhibition opens at Tate Modern, family and friends talk about Bowery’s larger-than-life legacy</p><p>In October 1980, 19 year-old Leigh Bowery arrived in London from the small Australian town of Sunshine in suburban Melbourne. He brought with him a single suitcase and a portable sewing machine. A few months later, he spent his first Christmas away from home in a rented bedsit feeling depressed and lonely. On 31 December, he attempted to raise his spirits by writing down his new year resolutions:</p><p>1. Get weight down to 12 stone.<br>
