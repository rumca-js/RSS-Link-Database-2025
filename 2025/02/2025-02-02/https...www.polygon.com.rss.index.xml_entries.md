<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>League of Legends</em> is over 15 years old. The game is nearly old enough to drive or vote, and its developers at Riot Games haven’t been shy about applying retcons or reworks to champions or other aspects of the game as needed. Even longtime players can find themselves surprised by these overhauls. For instance, one champion was in the game for 11 years before he was suddenly replaced with someone completely new, but with the same name. The new Viktor has been taken from <em>Arcane</em>, which is much less confusing to new players — but what happens to longtime fans of a champion when their beloved main character gets replaced with a “better” version?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, horror franchises are nearly as old as cinema itself. By the release of 1931’s adaptation of Bram Stoker’s <em>Dracula </em>— the first with sound — there was already a history of terrifying films in the silent era, especially among the geniuses working within the German Expressionism movement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The roots of horror films draw heavily from folklore, religion, and literature, which has meant many of the most enduring horror franchises are ones that existed far before film became a mainstream art form — <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Dracula</em>, <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, <em>The Invisible Man</em>.

He tries to be smooth, but fumbles and knocks over an entire display of oranges. They laugh together, and the rest is history; love at first sight. It’s the start of something beautiful — at least, until it’s not. <em>Companion</em> is about the
