<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a direct result of the 25% tariffs imposed on Canadian goods and services by the US government, I am looking at every opportunity to stop paying funds to US based companies and am asking for advice on which usenet providers are based in Europe/Asia/Africa and could be used as alternative service providers. I currently use UsenetExpress and UsenetServer. </p> <p>Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThePickwickFiles"> /u/ThePickwickFiles </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ig17fh/recommendations_for_nonus_ownedbased_providers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ig17fh/recommendations_for_nonus_ownedbased_providers/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>For background I have Frugal and I found out that recently they switched backbone. I would want a backbone with higher retention (for older stuff) and I think Omicron fits.</p> <p>Any recommendations? What about Eweka? I&#39;m based in south america (if that matters)</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rafa130397"> /u/Rafa130397 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ifkmo1/current_recommendations_for_providers_within/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ifkmo1/current_recommendations_for_providers_within/">[comments]</a></span>
