Currently I have a Raspberry Pi 4 running a web socket that sends the mail inbox data to my pico w and the pico w displays the information. The problem is for some reason my Pico ws keep dying after I run tests on them for a while. My first pico w died after me running some code on it using Thonny it started to not appear on Thonny, when I tried putting it on BOOTSEL mode it didn&#39;t show any new folders on my pc. After several days I tried again and it opened BOOTSEL mode I nuked it and installed micropython again. It was still kinda borken it didn&#39;t show up sometimes when I plugged it in my pc. But I kept on developing on it until I found out I couldn&#39;t connect to wifi on it, it gave me &quot;CYW43 core not up&quot; errors and didn&#39",

First, I flashed a full OS image onto a Samsung microSD, then I configured it to install an NVMe SSD with Docker and other programs (Pi-hole, WireGuard, etc.). I set it up to boot in the following order: USB first, then microSD, and finally the SSD (which are currently empty).</p> <p>Now, I would like to use Batocera or Recalbox on a microSD, so that when inserted into the Raspberry Pi, it would boot directly into the emulator, since it\u2019s connected to a TV. However, even though I correctly flash the image onto an Amazon microSD, the system boots into the OS with Batocera and Share folders on the desktop (or Recalbox), instead of launching the emulator automatically.</p> <p>Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hkds_3\"> /u/hkds_3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ig10q2/b",
