Today I'm talking about GANS, who are from Birmingham in England. There was a time when bands like GANS would have been discovered by visionary A&R people, but data seems to have replaced much of that drive. Anyway,  GANS are signed with Strap Originals and are working on their debut album, but I want to feature bands like GANS - who maybe aren't getting the recognition they deserve. Let me know who you think should be up there.
