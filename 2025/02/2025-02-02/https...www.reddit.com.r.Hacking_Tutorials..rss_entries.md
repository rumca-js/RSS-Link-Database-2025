<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently, I have access to all of my social media accounts, but I don’t actively have the passwords for all of them. I don’t know what emails they are attached to, so I can’t go reset them, even if allowed to. Is there a way to click a link or go through other ways to get the passwords to them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sofiod"> /u/Sofiod </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ig3yee/anyway_to_login_to_accounts_without_password/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ig3yee/anyway_to_login_to_accounts_without_password/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m in need to use a Quasar Rat on my child&#39;s computer. I know this isn&#39;t morally right, but I belive he is getting used so I have to be sure. I searched up ways to monitor computers and I found out about Quasar Rats, I watched a YouTube tutorial but they wouldn&#39;t tell me how to &quot;build it&quot;? I didn&#39;t really understand what he meant, he just said it would take like a bit of time and knowledge. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IFunne1"> /u/IFunne1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ifxxqv/i_need_help_setting_up_a_quasar_rat/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ifxxqv/i_need_help_setting_up_a_quasar_rat/">[comments]</a></span>
