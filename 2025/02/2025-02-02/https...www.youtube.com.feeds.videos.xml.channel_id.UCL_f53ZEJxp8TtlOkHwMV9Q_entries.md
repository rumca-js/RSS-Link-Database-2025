Robby Starbuck updates Dr. Jordan B. Peterson on his efforts to remove DEI and woke policies from the entrepreneurial landscape. In the short three months since his last appearance on the podcast, Robby has achieved some major wins with brands like Target and Meta, but also some major pushback - Costco specifically made a public announcement to uphold DEI policies. With the world fluctuating, power changing hands, and dueling narratives in heated competition, one thing is abundantly clear: now is not the time to become complacent.

Robby Starbuck, a filmmaker and anti-communist once directed Oscar-winning actors and some of the biggest music stars in the world but seeing the threat of Marxism in America set a fire inside him due to his own Mom and grandparents fleeing communism in Cuba. He knew he had to stand up. He started his public stand by endorsing Trump in the 2015 primary. Hollywood didnâ€™t like that very much.
