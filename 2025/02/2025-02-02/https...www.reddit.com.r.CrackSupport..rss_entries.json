I ran the game, it all came up, DLC notifications, language options, etc. That was, until, I went back to the Firefox window that I had installed the game from. And all of a sudden, there were ads in Russian that I didn\u2019t understand everywhere! There was some sort of Roblox video playing in the bottom right, and some fake Windows 95 looking taskbar at the top. It freaked me out so much, and thus turned off my internet on all devices and powered off my PC. NB: For some stupid reason, I turned off my VPN so my game would download faster. The comments on the Steamrip page weren\u2019t talking about this strange occurrence. I also have uBlock Origin . I suspect this is adware. If anybody can help me, that would be wonderful and I would be very grateful.

I downloaded all of the dlcs for the base game but for some reason only certain parts of them would show up in actual gameplay despite all of them being downloaded and using the dlc unlocker (for example in life or death it has a gameplay part where you can choose to play as a ghost and it works fine doing that but I couldn&#39;t play in the life or death world and none of the cas or build mode things were showing up and with laundry day despite having downloaded the pack and unlocking it there&#39;s no washing machines and the game mechanic for doing laundry isn&#39;t showing up)</p> <p>It wasn&#39;t really a huge problem but I wanted to have all of the packs so I switched to using the cracked game version and it worked great, all of the packs worked and everything was there. Then two days ago I reopened my game after closing it and the mods that had been working up",
