<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read a book in 2017 and I&#39;m having a tough time trying to remember what it was called. Essentially, from what I can remember, some dude acquired a machine that was shaped like a football, or was handheld in some form, and when he pressed the button on it, the machine created a portal or doorway to an apocalyptic future America. If I remember right, one of the scenes had him in like an airport or train station or something like that, and found skeletal remains of people all over, and the one that was mentioned most was a couple that looked like they died in each other&#39;s arms. At the very end of the book, I can&#39;t remember if it broke or if the machine quit working, but something happened to it. This has been driving me nuts for a while now, because I think it was part of a series, and I&#39;d love to read it again. Appreciate the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EarthWalker42"> /

Since when I was a kid only fiction did get my attention I remember finishing “Herakles”and “Prometei and Argonauts”in 3 days (128 pages each). And years later suddenly I have an urge to read again. I love GOT with Witcher and know a lot about them but there is also lotr which I know little about. Which do you think would fit for the first time reader of fiction which is more capturing(more inclined to read Witcher). Also i have an interesting option too mythologies like Greek and my country has a mythologies of brave and unusual acts done by people in 13th centuries to which an old man would give each of them a name DeDe KorKut.

Weird as in speculative, as in surreal, as in abstract, as in the narrative arc is more of a narrative circle, as in it didn’t make sense but you couldn’t shake it, as in highly atmospheric, as in you can’t think of anything else to call it.</p> <p>I have read and loved Alissa Nutting’s Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls (in which women become stews and ant farms), Mariana Enriquez’s The Dangers of Smoking in Bed (in which missing and dead children return in droves, and teenaged fan girls consume corpses), Karen Russell’s St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves, Paige Clark’s She Is Haunted, Yukiko Motoya’s The Lonesome Bodybuilder, Corinne Hoex’s Gentleman Callers, Octavia Butler’s Bloodchild, Jane Campbell’s Cat Brushing, Giovanna Rivero’s Fresh Dirt From the Grave, and countless single stories stumbled across in literary journals.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to read a lot as a kid and am 22 now getting back into it and loving it. I’ve finished all but the last two chapters of The Ballad Of Songbirds and Snakes in the span of two days. I’ve read the rest of The Hunger Games series, the whole Harry Potter series, Divergent series, and a couple miscellaneous books like Gullivers Travels, Ender’s Game, The Call of the Wild, Crime and Punishment, and The Grapes of Wrath. I tried to read the Lord of the Rings series as I love the movies but couldn’t get into it. I’ve really enjoyed all the other books listed but I want to venture out a little bit. I’m open to any type of book as long is it entertaining and has a great story. I’m particularly interested in westerns, early American/Native American fiction, mythic, and horror most of all, but also dystopians, historical fiction, and other worldly books. Not really looking for crime (unless it’s really good) or romance. Tyia! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in search of a book where the FMC is fresh out of a relationship due to something like the ex cheating and she engages in a fake relationship with someone to ward him off. Like maybe the ex talked crap about her to make it sound like she couldn&#39;t get anyone else or something. Maybe the ex started dating someone else to try and make her jealous because she wouldn&#39;t forgive him for the cheating and take him back. Bonus points if the guy she is fake dating is in a long distance (failing) relationship himself. Double bonus points if the the ex cheated with her best friend. I&#39;ve read someday maybe by Colleen Hoover already which has similar vibes but without the fake dating and I&#39;ve read the bad boy bargain by Kendra highley.
