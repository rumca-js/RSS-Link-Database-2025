<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been working for 10+ years in the RISC-V space (mainly AI and Network Packet processing accelerators) and teaching RISC-V computer architecture classes for 6+ years at both grad and undergrad levels. I got my PhD last year and transitioned to industry.</p> <p>I had a ton of material and recordings (thanks pandemic, I guess) of my lectures and decided to put them up on YouTube. First lecture is here --&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/izPdo7n1u1I">https://youtu.be/izPdo7n1u1I</a></p> <p>More to follow in the coming days. If you subscribe to the channel, you get notified when new videos are out.</p> <p>I&#39;m very hands-on in the approach; the idea is to finish the course with an in-order, single-pipeline RV32IM processor running Coremark.</p> <p>I plan a few bonus lectures on FPGA and ASAP7 synthesis flows, but that depends on how much traction I get on these videos.</p> <p>Love to get your feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub
