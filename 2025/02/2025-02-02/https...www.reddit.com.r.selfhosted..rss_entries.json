Currently only the servers and the websites are exposed to the outside network using a DNS record and nginx proxy manager with a router port forward. I understand that this is not the safest approach so I want to improve on this. I looked into CloudFlare tunnels but I am not sure how are the keeping my network safe and if the media servers would be able to access it since the clients are the apps on my phone and I do not control how they connect to the server.</p> <p>I would love some suggestions on how to do this. It&#39;s kind of a weird setup that some services should be public like the websites but others should only be available for me and maybe my spouse.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/omriyoffe\"> /u/omriyoffe",

My server is a crappy thin client that I opened up, added more RAM and disk space to, and installed debian then casaos on.</p> <p>Over the couple of weeks I&#39;ve had it, I&#39;ve endured the pain of figuring out setting up my own DNS server for the first time, realised that even with Twingate/Tailscale/Cloudflare I still can&#39;t access it on my work laptop for trips, and struggled with NGINX confs and oauth2-proxy configs on a VPS so I can access things from other devices where for whatever reason or another I can&#39;t install things while keeping things relatively locked down.</p> <p>I",

As it would run most of the time the energy efficiency is an important aspect for me I have so far considered a few of the solutions but I\u2019m not sure which would be preferred here and which in practice is the most energy efficient: 1. Some brand new Intel micro PC (e.g. with N95 or N97) 2. Building something custom from parts - seems to be the most expensive option 3. Some cheap post-leasing SFF from Lenovo For this option I can get e.g.: - Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 SFF i5-6500 4x3.2GHz 32GB 960GB SSD - Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 SFF i5-6500 4x3.2GHz 16GB 480GB SSD - Lenovo ThinkCentre M910q i5-6500T 4x2.5GHz 16GB 480GB 4.
