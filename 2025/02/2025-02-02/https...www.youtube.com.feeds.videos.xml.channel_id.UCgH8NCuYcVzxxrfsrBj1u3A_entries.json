There was a time when bands like GANS would have been discovered by visionary A&R people, but data seems to have replaced much of that drive. Anyway,  GANS are signed with Strap Originals and are working on their debut album, but I want to feature bands like GANS - who maybe aren't getting the recognition they deserve. Let me know who you think should be up there. \n\nGANS YouTube Page:  https://www.youtube.com/@GANS.BRUM.\n\nGANS on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/05PzzXnIetN4rWDlYv23SK?si=qFTrZyBVRZGHtlnc6MH1DQ\n\nThe new Darkness album comes out next month,  you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nThe Darkness are also going on tour across the UK in March, tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nTo talk to me on Patreon:  http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nGet ",
