Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

Today I'm joined by Jay to discuss the history of Diamond Distribution and the January 14th announcement of their filing Chapter 11 HERE: https://www.diamondcomics.com/Article/279611-Diamond-Comic-Distributors-Files-Voluntary-Petition-for-Relief-Under-Chapter-11

A 25th of January announcement indicates that on the 20th of January courts approved a $41 Million Dollar Debtor-in-Possession Financing agreement with JP Morgan-Chase to continue normal operations while they try to restructure.

That financing basically transfers the debts (potentially with financing interest) to the bank and offers capital to continue operations for an indeterminate period.
