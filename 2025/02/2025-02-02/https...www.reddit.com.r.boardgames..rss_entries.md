## Highly Competitive Personalities

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to get a broad opinion of the impact of competitive personalities on the overall enjoyment of a game. I recently got back from a trip where my friend group and I had a lot of downtime to play games in the evenings. One of my friends is highly competitive. In any game he plays, he intentionally seeks out ways to put other players at a disadvantage, and when he does these things he has to add in a rude comment to the tune of “I’m better than you”. It really gets under my skin to the point of us arguing, which made me wonder if I’m just being sensitive or if he’s being toxic. I could see it going both ways since the games we played allow for such “take that” moves, but I much rather prefer to have everyone enjoy a game and not target others. Curious what your take is, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mullet_Proof"> /u/Mullet_Proof </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bo

I love wildlife, love the design of it (especially the wooden animals) and like the look of the bag/deck building mechanics. </p> <p>However - I&#39;d love to know whether it is something people have played/would recommend?!

The only thing I&#39;m a bit iffy about is the stress track, and I&#39;m wondering if implementating a house rule could be the answer. </p> <p>I&#39;m proposing to ignore the restrictions on color grouping whme it comes to the stress track, so you can lower your stress level from one colour group to another by relaxing or resting, and there are only 6 heart cards in the game.

The Slaughters can only come into play by drawing their tokens, and Leatherface only moves one tile per turn (if you don&#39;t draw from the bag) whereas players move two, so it seems like pretty easy planning to just outmanoeuvre him. I guess the objective cards could make this harder, but if you only draw the &quot;travel to this location&quot; cards (which is most of them) you should be fine to just not use the bag at all. Planning on homebrewing a rule to say that the gas and keys go into the bag and have to be drawn to be carried, anyone else feel like this game seems to easy? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the__green__light"> /u/the__green__light </a>

I picked all the characters based on players personalities and objectives based on characters to make it as easy for us as possible. The rookie showed up, then wanted to pick his own. So i thought, it&#39;s their game also so let them have fun. I chose the Pilot just to see how it plays. The rookie ended up being disappointed with the Captain, I had chose the Soldier for him.

Sometimes, though, reality gets in the way in terrifying ways, like it did this past week</p> <p>My best friend Rob and I have been playing Sky Team for weeks. It’s a fantastic co-op game where you’re pilots trying to land a plane under tricky conditions. Each airport presents new challenges, making every landing a tense, high-pressure puzzle.</p> <p>But a few days ago, a plane and a helicopter collided at Reagan National Airport, just 10 minutes from my house. 67 people died, including children and families returning from a skating camp. It was the deadliest U.S. air disaster in 15 years. In Sky Team, an aerial collision is one of the many possible failures. As Rob opened the box, I told him I couldn’t play. Not when the tragedy was still fresh in my mind. The idea of making that mistake

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Bruno Cathala is my favorite board game designer with the quantity of games he puts out all the while having a philosophy of not going for the most complexity while maintaining depth, and I get the feeling he is not nearly covered by board game youtuber as much as I&#39;d expect considering the amount of highly-ranked games he has and the fact that he still puts out at least 3-5 new games or expansion per year. I went out of my way to try as many of his games as I could through BGA, my local gaming pub, my library and the games I could put my hands on, here are my short-form thoughts because there are a lot of them!</p> <p>__D tier (Not a dreadful time, but not worth going out of your way to try outside of curiosity of completionist mentality)__</p> <ol> <li>Sobek</li> </ol> <p>A drafting game with either obvious moves to do every turn or very unexciting mixup with power cards and a very convoluted penalty system.</p> <ol> <li>Mow</li> </ol> <p>A sup

Gamers or non-gamers alike love it - I haven’t had anyone walk away not saying they loved it. Newbies grasp it quickly and enjoy the drafting mechanic.

When I loaded the game from someone who has put a copy on TTS and selected the 1710 it gave me a deck of 12 player setup cards. We are either playing 4 or 5 players so I just wanted to know if it ends up being 5 what do the extra setup cards look like? Edit, I went back and found the extra cards for more players with 1710, they where hidden. I still cant tell what ones I am suppose to use in the 5 player game vs the 6 player game so what ones do i use and what do I remove for 5 players? is it random?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/undeadpickels"> /u/undeadpickels </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ifmflw/john_company_tab
