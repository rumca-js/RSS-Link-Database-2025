<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a book/series that has classic high fantasy tropes like wizards, elves, dragons, swords &amp; sorcery, etc, while being contemporary, character driven and not particularly dark. I have depression so I read for escapism and enjoyment. I&#39;m looking for something light-hearted and easy to read while still being adventurous, exciting and having high steaks and drama. Dark moments are fine, but no grimdark please.</p> <p>Recently, I&#39;ve been reading/watching/playing:</p> <p>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves The Art of Prophecy (don&#39;t see many recommendations for it, but it&#39;s fantastic) Mistborn (not a massive fan of Sanderson.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wanted to discuss the subgenre itself as while I enjoy reading regular fantasy books, I have a penchant for the darker side of the genre where the stakes are far higher as things that can go wrong can easily happen.</p> <p>For instance, one of my favorite series is the First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie as the saga doesn’t hold back on showing the brutal nature of the world it’s set in as all the main characters are heavily flawed individuals that are just trying to survive in a crazy world as Logan is sort of like a hero, but he is not so clean as a persona.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igakjc/anyone_here_into_dark_fantasy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1igakjc/anyone_here_into_dark_fantasy/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some books have prose that&#39;s quotably good—the author has a real talent for line prose. Maybe that&#39;s in eloquence, or conciseness, or a powerful observation, or a really good metaphor, or sheer poetry, or thrilling evocativeness, or stark bareness or leanness, or flawless communication of the complex, or eccentric diction, or whatever else you consider &quot;good prose&quot;. For me, a book is a lot easier to read if its prose draws me in.</p> <p>If you can think of quotable passages of good prose from books you&#39;ve read, comment them below! Let us see why these authors are worth reading for their prose . (And be sure to include the book and author in the comment.) My main thinking is that these quotes can serve as a kind of &quot;trailer&quot;, a sampling to advertise these books to interested readers, like myself.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I initially avoided Red Rising because I’m not a huge fan of sci-fi and because I had heard it was similar to the hunger games (it is nothing like the hunger games!), but now that I’m two-thirds of the way through the first book, I’ve been pleasantly surprised. The story is far more than just a typical sci-fi adventure—it’s a deep exploration of power, revolution, and the moral complexities of change.</p> <p>I thought Darrow’s initial loss of Eo is particularly well-executed. His grief and reaction is well done. I also like that her death isn’t just a moment of personal grief bit it forces Darrow onto a path he never would have chosen for himself. What makes it even more compelling is that he doesn’t fully understand her vision at first so we slowly get to discover that vision with him and get to watch him sacrifice pieces of himself as he works towards it.</p> <p>I also appreciate that the author doesn’t shy away from adult themes but allows us to f

I’ve already read The Mistborn Trilogy, Throne of Glass, and Fourth Wing, and I’m excited to explore more of the genre.</p> <p>Now, I’ve watched Game of Thrones (the TV series) and really enjoyed it (well… up to a certain point). But I’ve heard that A Song of Ice and Fire offers a much deeper experience. Is it still worth reading all the books if I already know most of the story from the show? I’ve seen people say the books are much better, but I’m curious if they hold up even after watching the series.</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts!

But those novels, and the upcoming one, float on top of a deep well of characters, stories, and worldbuilding.

I&#39;m sorry it took me so long to get to this one, but man, I&#39;m blown away.</p> <p>Ursula Le Guin has a writing style that forces you to read slow, but it rewards you because it&#39;s so <em>beautiful.</em> It reminded me a lot of Lord of the Rings, but it felt like she squeezed the content of a 1000-page epic into a 200-page novel.</p> <p>And I kind of loved that it wasn&#39;t a typical good-vs-evil story. It was more about personal growth and self-mastery. I thought the ending was powerful, and I felt rocked when I felt that resolution hit.</p> <p>Love love love. I&#39;m psyched to pick up the rest of the books in the series.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aaronnhallwrites"> /u/aaronnhallwrites </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ifmhre/finally_read_a_wizard_of_earthsea_and_wow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The writing is good, but I’m on chapter 5, and I’m having trouble getting into it. </p> <p>Here’s why. In the past year, I’ve read the Wheel of Time, The Stormlight Archive, Mistborn 1, The Dark Tower, and every book by Joe Abercrombie. </p> <p>Each of those stories dives deeper into character development. You get to know their thoughts, strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, etc. </p> <p>But Gardens of the Moon has yet to do that. The writing is good, but I don’t care about any of the characters because I’ve learned nothing about any of them. </p> <p>Should I keep going? Will I get more character development?

## They should have just let Hektor of Troy breed horses on his farm like he wanted to. (A review of David Gemmell’s Troy trilogy)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>quick version: I just binge read David Gemmell’s Troy trilogy and liked it a lot. It’s a great reimagining of the fall of Troy that has tons of violence and action, but also vivid descriptions that make the setting feel real, and enough compelling characters to keep me thoroughly invested. It’s definitely a tragedy, but has enough moments of heroism and compassion and solidarity to keep from feeling totally hopeless. </p> <p>Other notes:</p> <p>-I loved how many nuanced, interesting parent/child and quasi parent/child relationships there were in these books. Honestly pretty much all the character dynamics are great and there are SO many of them, it’s like a whole tangled web.</p> <p>-I loved the take on Odysseus, which felt both new enough to be interesting but still vaguely true to the spirit of the original character. Agamemnon is also very true to what I know of him from other stories, which is that he’s a dick and everyone rightfully hates him. I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>January was a big reading month for me. I went on vacation, put in my two-week notice at my job, and didn’t start my new job yet. This led to more than usual reading time which resulted in me breezing through 10 novels and 4 novellas. I thought it would be fun to post some mini reviews here. </p> <p>First the Novels:</p> <p><strong>Fourth Wing</strong> (The Empyrean #1) by Rebecca Yarros: <em>2.0/5.0 Stars</em></p> <p>This was… not for me. I don’t want to turn this review into a commentary on what Romantasy has done to the genre (I’m actually very supportive of how popular these books have become), so I’ll focus on the book. I found the characters and the world shallow and many of the plot points illogical and frustrating. The romance was all-consuming for many chapters in the second half of the book and while some people love that, it’s just not for me. </p> <p><strong>Deadly Education</strong> (The Scholomance #1) by Naomi Novik: <em>3.25/5.00 Star
