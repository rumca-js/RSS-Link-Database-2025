He told us these were a few of his favorite books. I remember a lot of students hated The Fault in Our Stars and criticized the book during lectures. After all, he did decide to assign a teen romance novel to a bunch of middle schoolers so I assumed he was prepared or wasn&#39;t too bothered by the criticism. If I were a teacher, I don&#39;t think I would have my students read my favorite books unless it was a classic novel like Of Mice and Men or Animal Farm. </p> <p>If you were a teacher, would you assign your favorite books to students?

I\u2019ve laughed, cried, trembled in fear and felt hope and disgust within almost every couple chapters that would pass. This book\u2019s theme and parallel to the Cain and Abel story is so devastating that the final pages of the book had me by the neck.

I catch them side-eyeing me while I\u2019m doomscrolling on my phone or rewatching <em>Friends</em> for the 27th time.</p> <p>The guilt is real, folks. It\u2019s like my bookshelf is haunted by the ghosts of plots unexplored and characters unmet. I\u2019ve officially put myself on a book-buying ban (yes, even during the World Book Fair 2025 in Delhi\u2014cue dramatic sob).</p> <p>So, I need to know\u2014how many unread books are too many? At what point do we go from \u201ccharming home library\u201d to \u201cdragon hoarding literary treasure\u201d? Asking for a friend (okay, it\u2019s me, I\u2019m the friend).</p> <p>Also, any tips on resisting the siren call of shiny new books while our TBR piles stare into our souls? Let\u2019s support each other in this struggle!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

Why do female characters fawn over him so much? Am I missing something? He\u2019s not particularly interesting, or likeable, yet almost every girl in the novel keeps fawning over him like he\u2019s James Bond. It\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s taking me out of the book whenever Midori is on her hands and knees for this man after one date. Even Reiko lowkey wants to fuck him and even says she wants the deets about his cock right in front of Naoko. </p> <p>I know this is a silly criticism, but am I missing something here? </p> <p>(Please no spoilers). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/billistenderchicken\"> /u/billistenderchicken </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ifnt6n/im_halfway_through_norwegian_wood_but_i_have_one/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h",
