<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking about when I was in 7th grade my teacher assigned us to read The Fault in Our Stars and The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. He told us these were a few of his favorite books. I remember a lot of students hated The Fault in Our Stars and criticized the book during lectures. After all, he did decide to assign a teen romance novel to a bunch of middle schoolers so I assumed he was prepared or wasn&#39;t too bothered by the criticism. If I were a teacher, I don&#39;t think I would have my students read my favorite books unless it was a classic novel like Of Mice and Men or Animal Farm. </p> <p>If you were a teacher, would you assign your favorite books to students?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don’t even know where to start with this book. Jacqueline Harpman’s I Who Have Never Known Men is one of the most quietly devastating things I’ve ever read. It’s not just bleak—it’s merciless. It takes everything you expect from a dystopian novel, strips it down to its rawest form, and then leaves you to sit in the silence of what’s left.</p> <p>The setup is simple: thirty-nine women and one young girl are locked in an underground bunker. The women have fragments of memories from a world before; the girl only knows captivity. Their only contact with the outside world comes in the form of silent, indifferent guards. Then, one day, something happens that completely upends their reality—not into freedom, but into something even worse.</p> <p>And that’s the thing about this book: it never gives you what you think it will. There’s no grand revelation, no satisfying resolution. Just an eerie, relentless meditation on loneliness, survival, and the sheer i

I read a lot of lit fic but I love any genre honestly. Recently I’ve enjoyed sci-fi, epic fantasy, classics (currently rereading the Odyssey), but I’ll try any book if it looks good! It’s just lot of the YouTube channels I’m finding seem to focus heavily on romance, which isn’t what I’ve been into lately. A couple I have liked are bridget b/bridgetish (also her TikTok), Lexi/newlynova, and The Book Leo. That’s kind of the vibe I’m hoping for I suppose.</p> <p>I tried to search around this subreddit for something but all the posts I found were a couple years old, and most of the suggestions weren’t around any more or had taken down their videos. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for any ideas! :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mrsrochester24"> /u/mrsr

Samuel Hamilton may be my favorite character in fiction ever. Steinbeck’s writing is beyond remarkable, so good you can feel in the writing even he knows it. I’ve laughed, cried, trembled in fear and felt hope and disgust within almost every couple chapters that would pass. This book’s theme and parallel to the Cain and Abel story is so devastating that the final pages of the book had me by the neck. I went to bible school in my twenties, and wrestled with the idea of free will so violently that I genuinely feel this book has healed some of the religious trauma of my past.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This book was so captivating. The genre of book is more of a suspense thriller for me. I mean there is enough drama in this but any time <span class="md-spoiler-text">Anton Chigurh comes, I am up on my feet wondering what kind of hell is is this psycho going to do.</span> The suspense and eeriness of <span class="md-spoiler-text">Chigurh</span> is appreciable. This book is more of a cat and mouse game with many cats and mice in a sprawl. <span class="md-spoiler-text">Some cats made it some didn’t, but in the end no mice ever made it.</span></p> <p>I wish the dialogues had more punctuation. At some points the dialogues were just boring but mostly it was good for me. This is such a must read book for me. The way the story is set makes this book more enjoyable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zzuhruf"> /u/zzuhruf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ifqfx1/no_country_fo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m really enjoying the book so far. I’m about half-way through. But one thing that is bugging me is the MC Toru Watanabe. Why do female characters fawn over him so much? Am I missing something? He’s not particularly interesting, or likeable, yet almost every girl in the novel keeps fawning over him like he’s James Bond. It’s getting to the point where it’s taking me out of the book whenever Midori is on her hands and knees for this man after one date. Even Reiko lowkey wants to fuck him and even says she wants the deets about his cock right in front of Naoko. </p> <p>I know this is a silly criticism, but am I missing something here? </p> <p>(Please no spoilers). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/billistenderchicken"> /u/billistenderchicken </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ifnt6n/im_halfway_through_norwegian_wood_but_i_have_one/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h
