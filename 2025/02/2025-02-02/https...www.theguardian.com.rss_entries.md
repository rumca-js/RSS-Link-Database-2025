<p>Arguably the greatest act of literary vandalism in history becomes masterly TV, as we see Cassandra Austen destroy thousands of her sister Jane’s letters following her death – out of love</p><p>This year is the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth. Janeites rejoice (in suitably restrained and quietly sardonic fashion)! Brontë devotees – I suppose you had better go for a long walk across a large moor until it is one of your lot’s time to shine again.</p><p>Until then, it is all things Austen. Expect genteel celebrations from Bath to Hampshire and screen and print schedules stuffed with tributes to, dramas inspired by and features about the great woman and her works for the next 12 glorious months. First off the televisual blocks is Miss Austen, an adaptation of Gill Hornby’s book of the same name, which tells the story of the just-beginning-to-be-famed Regency novelist through the eyes of the beloved sister who long survived her, Cassandra – played by Keeley Hawes with her cust

<p>Donald Trump’s initiative echoes past mistakes and could provoke adversaries and undermine efforts toward nuclear diplomacy</p><p>With a stroke of his pen, Donald Trump last week ordered an “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/donald-trump-executive-orders-signed-list">iron dome for America</a>” – an act that risks sparking a destabilising global arms race. Mr Trump’s proposal takes its name from Israel’s air defence system, but it is cast in more ambitious terms for the US: a space-based interception system designed to counter nuclear, hypersonic and cruise missile threats.</p><p>It is also the latest turn of the wheel in a cycle of escalation. Moves by Washington to “increase security” have repeatedly ended up making the world more volatile and unsafe.

Waiving her right to anonymity, the 72-year-old made her ordeal public so that, in her words, “shame must change sides”. For nearly 10 years, her husband of 50 years Dominique had invited dozens of men via an online site (now closed) to rape her while she lay comatose in bed in their home near Avignon. Each time, he had sedated her with a mix of anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills slipped into her food and glasses of wine. He filmed the rapes and stored the videos neatly in his computer under the title “abuse”.</p><p>Dominique Pelicot may never have been arrested had it not been for the perseverance of supermarket security guards who noticed him making upskirt videos

<p>Tottenham were in no position to spurn a crucial goal off somebody’s backside and, give or take a few centimetres, that is exactly what they were handed here. Their season had been in freefall but a first league victory since 15 December was well earned, particularly given the scratchy resources at Ange Postecoglou’s disposal. Another makeshift backline, in which Archie Gray was outstanding, withstood one of the division’s toughest physical examinations and deserved their luck at the other end through Vitaly Janelt’s first-half own goal.</p><p>The Brentford goalkeeper Hákon Valdimarsson, making his first top-flight start due to Mark Flekken’s injury, should have spared Janelt’s blushes in dealing more decisively with the corner that struck his teammate. But he was less culpable three minutes from time when Pape Sarr, finishing deftly after being played through by Son Heung-min, made the points safe.

<p>How can neighbors have such a fundamental disagreement about seemingly basic concepts of rightness and justice?</p><p>In 2016, it was easy for the left to process Donald Trump’s election as a fluke – thanks to the electoral college, he’d essentially won on a technicality.

What’s striking about him is that he doesn’t pretend otherwise. Presidents in recent memory at least paid lip service to compassion; the new one has made exclusion, spite and bullying his brand.

<p>Two weddings, one double booking and a series of cliches are the order of the day in Nicholas Stoller’s Bride Wars-lite comedy</p><p>Any film combining the comedy talents of Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon is unlikely to be entirely terrible. That said, the wildly uneven wedding clash comedy <em>You’re Cordially Invited</em> is certainly in the vicinity of terrible on numerous occasions. Ferrell plays Jim, the smothering, widowed dad of Jenni (Geraldine Viswanathan); Witherspoon is Margot, the overprotective older sister of Neve, played by Meredith Hagner. When, due to an administrative snafu, Jenni’s and Neve’s weddings are double booked at the same venue, Jim and Margot are determined that their loved ones will still get their day to remember, no matter the cost to the rival party or to personal dignity. Wedding catastrophe cliches abound (cakes, hair and frocks take the brunt of the physical comedy). Ferrell’s crocodile wrestling scene notwithstanding, this just feels like a

<p><strong>The Place, London</strong><br>Sean Gandini’s intricate and artful show about magic shows plays with the audience and the malleable sense of reality</p><p>There’s a quote, Sean Gandini tells us, from the French father of modern conjuring Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin, which translates as: Say what you don’t do. Do what you don’t say. This philosophy of misdirection is one of the principles underlying this latest show from Gandini Juggling, a unique group that’s been plying its trade for more than 30 years. They juggle, yes, but not in the way you’d see at the circus. This is theatre, with a choreographer’s eye for the arrangement of bodies, balls and hoops, and every show is a deep dive into a new idea. In Heka, it is the art of magic. The seven-strong cast, already adept at manipulating juggling props, have learnt some impressive sleight of hand. Balls appear and disappear; they’re about to be tossed in the air then suddenly evaporate; they unexpectedly pop-up in someone’s mou

The soup was good, using the entire head, or at least those stalks I hadn’t torn away and munched raw the moment I arrived home.

<p>According to a new poll, half of our 13- to 27-year-olds can’t see the point of all those time-wasting elections and parliaments. Why do they not know that authoritarianism is worse?</p><p>The phrase “shocking findings” is hugely overused in the media, which is strange because it’s so clumsy. The word endings nearly rhyme, but not quite, and there’s something infantile about the word “finding” for something you’ve found. Is your lunch your eatings? Did you do any pooings this morning? Always go for a weeing before leaving the house – or building.</p><p>Most “shocking findings” don’t turn out to be that shocking. The phrase gets deployed to dupe you into reading on and then it’s just some study that’s come out with something predictably depressing. Not this time. Last week, there were some genuinely shocking findings. I’d go so far as simply to call them shockings. Never mind that they were found – that’s not their key characteristic at all. They’re shockings, infuriatings and fran

<p>Suddenly our family life becomes an unfunny sitcom</p><p>My daughter is crying. She is holding a tiny red London bus, one of her favourite toys, and the terrible thing that has happened to her is that she has smashed our television with it. The screen is completely destroyed, with a central impact now radiating a small spider web of white lines, within a larger morass of jagged, blocky blues, greens and purples that crowd out the picture on its surface.</p><p>I am too stunned to move, the impact having happened so fast that I’ve yet to process it at all. My first thoughts, such as they exist in this zen-like state of paralysis, are of the immediate financial cost of what she’s done. Thus, the denial phase of grief kicks in swiftly. I switch the TV off, perhaps hoping the very clearly annihilated screen is a signal fault. I turn it back on, dismayed to discover that no, this was not an emergency broadcast from Smashed Telly Gold +1; my two-year-old has just managed to do £400’s wor

Around me, passengers built little homes for themselves out of laptops and crisps, a whole universe on a plastic fold-down table. The computer screen acted primarily as a barrier, an emotional-load-bearing wall. Objects and arms were removed from sleeves and erected in delicate piles – illusions of privacy were magicked in the quiet coach. Rooms were fashioned on laps behind seats, or ideas of rooms; walled, breaded concepts – here is a kitchenette formed from Pret a Manger baguettes and precarious coffees, here is the memory-foam neck pillow, a portable bedroom, and here onscreen at 250km an hour is a working office, fizzing with legitimacy and blue light. I looked around with love at this side of us, we silly animals,

She talks  about her working-class roots, being lucky in love, the frustration of being passed over for serious roles – and why she’s fed up <br>with feeling anxious</p><p>These last few weeks, Sheila Hancock has surrendered. “I’m addicted, really,” she’s confessing. “I just can’t stop myself. I’m at it every night, without fail.” She halts, shakes her head, looks troubled, momentarily. “And everyone is fucking crying all the time. I can’t understand why for the life of me.” She leans forward, blue eyes piercing. Clocking my confusion, she grins wryly. “I’m talking about that television show, darling. What’s it called? No, don’t tell me. I’ll get there.”</p><p>Her old pal Gyles Brandreth, Hancock informs me, always makes her find the word she’s searching for when it escapes her. “He won’t chip in. ‘You <em>must </em>remember it yourself,’ he says, ‘because not doing so makes you forget.’ So I do, w

<p>The first volume of the tech baron turned philanthropist’s memoirs focuses on his parent’s struggles to control him – and a painful early loss</p><p>The enduring mystery about William Henry Gates III is this: how did a precocious and sometimes obnoxious kid evolve into a billionaire tech lord and then into an elder statesman and philanthropist? This book gives us only the first part of the story, tracing Gates’s evolution from birth in 1955 to the founding of Microsoft in 1975. For the next part of the story, we will just have to wait for the sequel.</p><p>In a way, the volume’s title describes it well. In the era before machine learning and AI, when computer programs were exclusively written by humans, the term “source code” meant something. It described computer programs that could be read – and understood, if you knew the programming language – enabling you to explain why the machine did what it did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/02/source-code-by-bill

<p>Alexander Gronsky’s photograph of families in the snow hints at something more dubious</p><p>The photographer Alexander Gronsky calls the series of pictures he took in Moscow suburbs, after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, <em>Something </em><em>Is Going on Here</em>. This image of families in the snow has a kind of dubious innocence. It is juxtaposed in other photos in the collection with military vehicles idling in these same winter landscapes at the edge of the city, and uniformed Russian soldiers mingling with ordinary residents. The contrast gives all of the images a disturbing edge of menace. You find yourself looking hard, for example, at the couple of figures on the right of this picture, in authoritarian black, and wondering how they fit with the people in the primary-coloured jackets. They are part of a landscape in which “normal life” is never quite what it seems.</p><p>Gronsky was born in Estonia, and has been based in Russia for most of his career – despite being arreste

<p>It was famous for giving an over-the-top look, now contouring is back – only this time it is subtle and refined</p><p>Contouring involves applying darker and lighter shades of makeup to areas of the face (tops of the forehead, cheekbones, bridge of the nose and chin) to sculpt and define features. Popularised by the Kardashians, it has a reputation for giving you an OTT, social media-influencer face, one that strikes fear into the hearts of makeup minimalists. But there’s a better, more subtle option – contouring products that make skin look like skin (and not a mask) and a decent expert-led tutorial (check out <a href="http://charlottetilbury.com/">charlottetilbury.com</a>).</p><p><strong>1.

All countries with targets met them, renewables spread much more quickly than expected, and emissions in the Kyoto bloc fell by over 20%, at least partly because of these policies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2025/feb/02/how-the-oil-majors-sabotaged-kyoto">Continue reading...</a>

In the spirit of the fresh start, then, this week strikes me as being the perfect time to give tired drinking habits leftover from last year a bit of a makeover – and no wine country in the world is better equipped to do that than Italy. There are more than 500 indigenous grape varieties spread around the Italian peninsula and islands, with vineyards, and distinctive wine cultures, in all of the country’s 20 administrative regions. For a sense of the sheer range and contrast you could begin at either end of an A to Z: a lush, darkly bittersweet heav
