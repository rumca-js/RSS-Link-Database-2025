<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a beginner on all of this so please excuse my lack of knowledge.</p> <p>I&#39;m making a desk gadget with a OLED screen that can play little animations and show useful info about my mail inbox etc.. Currently I have a Raspberry Pi 4 running a web socket that sends the mail inbox data to my pico w and the pico w displays the information. The problem is for some reason my Pico ws keep dying after I run tests on them for a while. My first pico w died after me running some code on it using Thonny it started to not appear on Thonny, when I tried putting it on BOOTSEL mode it didn&#39;t show any new folders on my pc. After several days I tried again and it opened BOOTSEL mode I nuked it and installed micropython again. It was still kinda borken it didn&#39;t show up sometimes when I plugged it in my pc. But I kept on developing on it until I found out I couldn&#39;t connect to wifi on it, it gave me &quot;CYW43 core not up&quot; errors and didn&#39

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 5. First, I flashed a full OS image onto a Samsung microSD, then I configured it to install an NVMe SSD with Docker and other programs (Pi-hole, WireGuard, etc.). I set it up to boot in the following order: USB first, then microSD, and finally the SSD (which are currently empty).</p> <p>Now, I would like to use Batocera or Recalbox on a microSD, so that when inserted into the Raspberry Pi, it would boot directly into the emulator, since it’s connected to a TV. However, even though I correctly flash the image onto an Amazon microSD, the system boots into the OS with Batocera and Share folders on the desktop (or Recalbox), instead of launching the emulator automatically.</p> <p>Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hkds_3"> /u/hkds_3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ig10q2/b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,<br/> I’m working on a live camera project to film a surf spot and stream the video on a website. My goal is to have an autonomous system without needing a PC running all the time. I’m still a beginner in IT, but I’m learning bit by bit.</p> <p><strong>Equipment used:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Raspberry Pi 3B+</li> <li>1440p USB Camera</li> <li>4G Dongle with SIM card</li> </ul> <p><strong>What I’ve tried so far:</strong><br/> <strong>First attempt:</strong><br/> I installed Raspberry Pi OS with Desktop, then OBS Studio to stream the video feed.<br/> I wanted to control everything remotely with AnyDesk.<br/> ❌ Problem: The Pi 3 is way too slow in Desktop mode…</p> <p><strong>Second attempt:</strong><br/> I tested lighter versions of the system (Raspberry Pi OS Lite).<br/> I managed to set up MotionEye to capture the video feed locally.<br/> ❌ Problem: The feed is only accessible on the same network as the Pi… Can&#39;t access it remotely.<

I got everything to work so far, I can connect to it using PuTTy and I can view the boot process, but I am getting hung up on the login in process, it doesn&#39;t seem to be taking any keyboard input from my laptop at all. I followed the Adafruit tutorial for this but I&#39;m not sure what I am doing wrong.</p> <p>enable_uart=1</p> <p>dtparam=uart0</p> <p>dtparam=uart0_console<br/> Is the current changes I have made to config.txt following the Adafruit guide.</p> <p>so far I have tried commenting out enable_uart=1 which gave me no output at all through Putty, and commenting out dtparam=uart0 which did nothing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnathonRules"> /u/JohnathonRules </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ifnvyf/serial_connection_help/">[link
