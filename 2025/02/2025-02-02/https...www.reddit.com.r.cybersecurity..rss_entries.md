<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m getting my Masters in Cybersecurity and am currently talking a Cryptography class. Our second chapter goes over number theory and I am totally lost on how this will be applied.</p> <p>I know broad definitions of each of the theorems (Fermat’s, Euler’s, Chinese Remainder), but actually working through problems involving them is confusing me. We don’t get many resources other than the posted PowerPoint and textbook and I’ve considered asking the professor if he has any recommendations. I’ve looked up some vids on YouTube trying to break it down and it’s not what I need.</p> <p>Do y’all have any experiences or suggestions for this?</p> <ul> <li>Signed a non-advanced math person</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Weak-Watercress-1273"> /u/Weak-Watercress-1273 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1igblvv/learning_number_theory_for_cryptography_what/">[link]

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I find online passphrase generators to be kinda annoying in that I have a hard time remembering the words unless I can come up with a way to associate them in my mind. So this got me wondering about more manual ways of creating passphrases of seemingly random words. I know, I know passphrases are supposed to be truly random, but what if the words are related only by physical or meaningful proximity?</p> <p><strong>Example 1</strong> - Words for a personal trip or experience</p> <p>Cabin Cousin Manhattan Snowboard - I went on a snowboarding trip. I stayed at my cousin&#39;s cabin and we drank manhattans. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t, but it gets the point across. Obviously, the words need to be carefully chosen, Snowboard, lift, lodge, run, diamond, etc are all clearly in the snowsport category couldn&#39;t be used together. But could it be sorta &quot;madlibbed&quot;? Duration, Activity, Food/Drink, Relation, Purchase, What movie did you watch, what game did

I’m frustrated that they’re choosing to ignore it.</p> <p>What’s my best course of action here? Should I just let it go, or is there something else I can do?</p> <p>EDIT: As people are asking for more context and I understand I’ve probably been to vague I’m going to provide more details.</p> <p>The co

The database was discovered so easily, so is it plausible that all data was harvested (including chats from days before the leak)?</li> <li><strong>Public Data Dump Risk?</strong> If all the data was downloaded, how likely is it that someone will eventually post the entire dataset online? Have similar breaches led to full public dumps that are searchable, and what has been the typical outcome?</li> <li><strong>Data Remediation?</strong> If my data—including personal identifiers—is part of the leak and gets posted publicly, is there any realistic way to hide or wipe it from search results?
