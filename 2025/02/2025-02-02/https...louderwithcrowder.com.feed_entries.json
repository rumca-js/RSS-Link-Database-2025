However, San Diego officials have decided that the most compassionate thing to do was to allow these lunatics to camp on the street. Subsequently, investigators have confirmed this is why the La Jolla, Mission Valley, and Rancho Bernardo fires started.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Breaking: The fire across from Fashion Valley started when a homeless man tried cooking with a Bunsen burner, destroying two apartments causing 2 families to now be homeless. He was burned & taken to the hospital. <",
