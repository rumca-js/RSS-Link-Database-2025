Firearms Factory is about the forced conversion of your candy factory into an arms factory during the Second World War. While your purpose in life was once to bring joy to children, unfortunately you now find yourself on your way to becoming a supporter of the war. Your main goal is to produce weapons for your country and win the war.</p> <p>Firearms Factory is a mix of Tycoon, Strategy and Simulation genres. My biggest inspirations are Game Dev Tycoon, This War of Mine and Hearts of Iron IV. For now, I plan to add a campaign mode where you will play the story of discovering fission, but I also really want to create a sandbox version in the future.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Firearms Factory doesn&#39;t have a demo yet, but one will be available shortly. If you are interested in the theme, I would be very happy if you add it to your wishlist!</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/18089

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>RUSTY RANGERS</strong> is an action-platformer with pixel art that I‚Äôve meticulously drawn over several years, combining classic gameplay with modern mechanics. You take on the role of one of the last surviving rangers, the final hope of a world in ruins. Once, this land was filled with harmony and order, but everything changed when the Baron arrived. Now, chaos reigns, and reality resets again and again.</p> <p><strong>RUSTY RANGERS</strong><br/> üé• <em>Trailer</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNpbGiLk0A8"><em>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNpbGiLk0A8</em></a></p> <p><strong>Steam Page</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599420/Rusty_Rangers/"><strong>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599420/Rusty_Rangers/</strong></a> </p> <p>üî∏ <strong>Classic gameplay with modern mechanics.</strong> Choose a ranger with a unique fighting style and abilities, combine power-ups, and battle relentless enemies.<br/> üî∏ <strong>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Goblin Auto Club Manager is not a racing game. You are the manager of a crazy motorsport club. You have to buy parts from the junkyard, customize your car for the different race tracks, and then hope that your stupid goblin drivers don&#39;t cause too many crashes. The game is casual and relaxed, but it does require strategy and experimentation to optimize the car&#39;s characteristics for the different tracks.</p> <p>You can check out a review from Higher Plain Games: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnb8oXtnf10">www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnb8oXtnf10</a></p> <p>Or you can watch the trailer and download the demo on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993970/Goblin_Auto_Club_Manager/">store.steampowered.com/app/2993970/Goblin_Auto_Club_Manager/</a></p> <p>Since the release half a year ago, I have added 3 more race tracks, one more championship, and several quality of life improvements.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2
