<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, the 1931 adaptation suffered from the effects of the 1929 crisis, which is why it did not have a large budget like <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> (1923), <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> (1925), and <em>The Man Who Laughs</em> (1928). One of the reasons for the excessive simplification of the story was budgetary constraints. That&#39;s why they chose to adapt the play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston instead of the book. It would be more cost-effective.</p> <p>Bela Lugosi&#39;s performance as Dracula was stunning, the cinematography, the sets in Dracula&#39;s castle were sensational. Lugosi looked great as a dangerous and seductive vampire, unlike Max Schreck, who played Count Orlok (in the unauthorized adaptation of Dracula) and was repulsive.</p> <p>This is why Renfield, and not Jonathan Harker, went to Transylvania to negotiate with Count Dracula the purchase of his new property in England.

But still entertaining.</p> <p>Now the final shot see&#39;s Barbara Harris&#39; Blanche character break the fourth wall and wink to the camera after she miraculously finds the diamond in the house, with her partner exclaiming that she did it, she&#39;s indeed a real psychic!</p> <p>What is your takeaway from this? Is she winking because she knows she&#39;s always actually been psychic, or is she winking to us because she&#39;s not, and found out where it was by other means (perhaps overhearing the other two discussing it).</p> <p>I don&#39;t believe we&#39;re ever shown her finding out about it on screen, maybe I&#39;m wrong and if so let me know. Otherwise those are the two options. Either way that wink is iconic for me and I loved Barbara&#39;s performance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://

Inclusion of characters from competing studios/Intellectual properties.</p> <p>The animation is art. It&#39;s perfectly imperfect. Today it would be CGI.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the scene of sex comedy in India but I watched this movie and man! What an intelligent sex comedy. Very raw and underrated.</p> <p>It was one of Netflix’s first Indian original films and is often described as India’s answer to American Pie, but with a much quirkier and intellectual twist.</p> <p>If you like offbeat, indie comedies with an irreverent, satirical edge, Brahman Naman is worth a watch. It’s a rare attempt at blending Indian coming-of-age storytelling with Western-style raunchy humor. However, if you prefer more emotionally rich or mainstream narratives, this might not be your cup of tea</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Reasonable-Winner-17"> /u/Reasonable-Winner-17 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ifsccp/brahman_naman/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ifsccp/brahman_naman/">[comments]</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Way back in the early to mid 90s as a teenager, when I started expanding my film viewing to include non-English language films.<br/> I watched a film on the telly, probably Channel 4.<br/> I think it was from North Africa(Morocco, Algeria, possibly Tunisia). It was a sort of coming of age film, about a boy.<br/> The two key scenes that have stuck with me. The first one, is where he tells his older friends/cousins that he can still convince his mother to take him to the communal bathhouse, (instead of having to go with his father to the mens side) where he can spy on the women.<br/> The second one involves the main boy being given the used chewing gum, of a pretty girl, he then gives the wad of gum to a local pensioner who is slightly obsessed by said girl and saves it in a small tin.<br/> The details are a little fuzzy, but it is some 30yrs since I happened upon it late one night. Hopefully someone can recognise the film from my ramblings.</p> </div>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About 20 years ago, I was channel surfing and came across HBO or something, and I only watched this one scene. I thought the movie was a Michelle Pfeiffer movie like To Gillian on her 37th Birthday.</p> <p>Basically, this creepy guy was being inappropriate or had been inappropriate earlier in the film, or maybe this girl didn&#39;t like him for whatever reason. The girl was young and attractive, and the guy was kind of weird or unattractive and older.</p> <p>Anyway, this girl went on like a hateful diatribe and proceeded to verbally destroy him. Basically, he was a pathetic terrible creep who deserved to die.</p> <p>The scene kind of stuck with me, but I have no idea what the context was or why she hated this guy so much, and now it&#39;s bugging me that I don&#39;t know.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just watched the Nicolas Cage film &#39;Time to Kill&#39; from 1989. Google said that it was on Roku and that&#39;s where I watched it. Roku said the runtime was 1 hour and 43 minutes. The movie cut right when the credits would have started. It was so jarring of a cut, I looked to see if I could find another version of the ending to see if I missed something. There is apparently a version of the film on YouTube.This version has a runtime of 1 hour and 40 minutes and plays through the whole credits. If you search Google (which pulls from IMDb I believe), IMDb, and the Wikipedia article; it says the runtime is 1 hour 50 minutes.</p> <p>I have noticed this happening a lot. I&#39;ve had a DVD box in hand and it&#39;ll give one time on the back, that will match Wiki but not match IMDb.
