<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! 👋</p> <p>I&#39;ve built a small system where AI agents SSH into various machines to monitor service status and generate reports. While this works well, I feel like I&#39;m barely scratching the surface of what&#39;s possible.</p> <p>Current Setup: - AI agents that can SSH into multiple machines - Automated service status checking - Report generation - Goal: Reduce manual work for our consultants</p> <p>What I&#39;m Looking For: 1. Real-world examples of AI agents being used in IT ops/infrastructure 2. Creative use cases beyond basic monitoring 3. Ideas for autonomous problem-solving (e.g., agents that can identify AND resolve common issues) 4. Ways to scale this concept to handle more complex scenarios</p> <p>For those who&#39;ve implemented similar systems: What interesting problems have you solved? Any unexpected benefits or challenges? I&#39;m particularly interested in use cases that significantly reduced manual intervention.</p> <p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This paper presents a new distributed training approach called Streaming DiLoCo that overlaps computation and communication during model training. The key innovation is streaming partial parameter updates between nodes continuously rather than waiting for complete updates, similar to a pipelined architecture.</p> <p>Main technical points: - Implements asynchronous parameter streaming protocol that maintains consistency - Uses adaptive compression for network efficiency - Introduces overlap-aware scheduling algorithm - Modifies optimizer for stability with partial updates - Background process handles streaming while main thread computes</p> <p>Results from their experiments: - 90% scaling efficiency on 64 GPU cluster - 75% reduction in communication overhead - Comparable model quality to synchronous training - Tested on models from 100M to 1B parameters - Minimal additional memory overhead (&lt;5%)</p> <p>I think this could be particularly impactful f

I have a Bachelors in Liberal Arts (Major- Political Science and Public Policy) and one of the firms that came to our college for recruitment was a leading American data engineering company. They were looking for students from Economics, creative writing, English, journalism, political science, etc. departments for the position of generative AI associates (remote, contract-basis), even with no experience in the field of AI. Are there other such positions that have opened up in the field or are in the process of opening up?
