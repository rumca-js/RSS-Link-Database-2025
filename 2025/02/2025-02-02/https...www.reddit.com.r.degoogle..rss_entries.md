It&#39;s something I&#39;m very eager to do, but I am a bit of a tech newb. </p> <p>The main reason for me wanting to degoogle is to give no more money to Google - any added security measures is a bonus. I don&#39;t have a ton of free cash, so subscriptions to services are going to have to be based on necessity for me. </p> <p>I guess my questions are:</p> <ol> <li><p>Do I just follow the instructions as per GrapheneOS to start the new setup of my phone?</p></li> <li><p>How have you guys dealt with gmail and degoogling? My account is linked to pretty much everything..</p></li> <li><p>What apps do you recommend for: a) texting and phone (is this even needed?), b) photos/camera, c) files and ebooks, d) calendar</p></li> </ol> <p>As you can probably tell, I&#39;m overwhelmed at the amount of information out there.

But I was thinking, would it be better to have such apps on the main profile, and personal/private apps (Brave, Aurora Store, Proton, ect.) in the work profile?</p> <p>The pros of having the bad apps in the main profile would be things like calendar/alarms working, opening messages and calls (i.e. calling a number that was linked in an email by pressing it), phone and service-specific apps and utilites, home screen widgets, and so on.</p> <p>From what I&#39;ve read, the work profile is 100% separated, so it seems it&#39;d be an OK choice.
