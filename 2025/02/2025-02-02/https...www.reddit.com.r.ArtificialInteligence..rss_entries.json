If this is true, the decisions made by the Trump administration could be critical in shaping how transformative AI is deployed, how safe it is, and key arms race-style dynamics. Trumps position and actions on AI really matter. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFL8HuPTr94\">In this video,</a> I covered updates from the last few weeks on DeepSeek and Trump&#39;s position on AI.</p> <p>While relevant Metaculus predictions haven&#39;t shifted dramatically (median AGI timeline moved slightly closer to 2026), I&#39;d argue that the <em>nature</em> of how we might reach AGI has become riskier.

I&#39;m simply wondering if any established labs or computer scientists are looking into the following? </p> <p>I was listening to a lecture on the perceptron this evening and they talked about how modern artificial neural networks mimic the behavior of biological brain neural networks. Specifically, the artificial networks have neurons that behave in a binary, on-off fashion. However, the lecturer pointed out biological neurons can exhibit other behaviors:</p> <ul> <li>They can fire in coordinated groups, together.</li> <li>They can modify the rate of their firing.</li> <li>And there may be other modes of behavior I&#39;m not aware of...</li> </ul> <p>It seems reasonable to me that at a minimum, each of these behaviors would be the physical signs of information transmission, storage or processing. In other words, there has to be a reason for these behaviors and th",
