Rep. Eugene Vindman (D-Va.) said on Friday that President Trump should be accountable for potential issues that led to the deadly aircraft crash this past week, noting the incident occurred while he was already in office. In an interview with MSNBC&#8217;s Ali Velshi, Vindman said there&#8217;s no &#8220;warmup&#8221; period for presidents before they bear responsibility&#8230;
