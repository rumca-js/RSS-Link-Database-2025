<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So long story short, Been having a blast with vr for the first few days atleast, But there hasn&#39;t been a game that really took my itch...Well brushworks and rec room aside, I don&#39;t know why the batman vr game felt like hassle for some reason but tho I liked the aspects like the little objects it gives you to mess around with</p> <p>But honestly, And I don&#39;t know why, But I always had fun with rec room for the most point of things, Like the climbing map or even the main dorm room where you can just mess around with objects around you, And you know...I wanted a game thats fully like that and focused on sandbox or having fun, While I like me some superhot vr or maybe something like the half life 2 mod for vr, Sometimes I just want to chill around and have fun.</p> <p>So any more so sandboxy/casual games that are around the quest (I most preferably free for now till I get start buying actual stuff since I only bought superhot vr for now)</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Seen a couple people report that the Pimax Crystal and Varjo Aero do not work on the RTX 5000 series and I&#39;ve personally had my Crystal not work on my 5090 even when using an expensive, powered DP Repeater. Anyone who&#39;s on a super high res HMD or was planning on a soon to release one as a primary purchasing factor may wanna hold off on buying a 5000 series GPU. </p> <p>So far I&#39;ve seen people report the Valve Index, BSB, and PSVR2(tested myself) work in terms of DP based headsets. So seems like it might be mainly effecting super high res HMDs using heavier DSC as the Crystal/Aero use a lot more bandwidth than any of those.</p> <p>Headsets with wireless streaming(I.e Quest/Pico) don&#39;t appear to be effected by this problem specifically, least from what I&#39;ve seen do chime in if you have experience saying otherwise.</p> <p>If you&#39;re one of the few people that does have a 5000 series GPU and a different headset than already listed,

I’ve been academically working on VR for a while, but over the last few months, I started working on VR video art, something that seems really rare in the VR space for some reason. So, I wanted to quickly share with you three short (3-7mins) pieces I prepared, each on a different theme (roughly, existential, psychedelic, and political). The Youtube VR playlist is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz7AJTZjck-kUa6iJ3TVwsDr9ivwsgbsm">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz7AJTZjck-kUa6iJ3TVwsDr9ivwsgbsm</a> . Of course I’d love to hear your thoughts on them. And if you know of other VR video artists, or are one yourself, I’d love to get your VR video links.</p> <p>For those who might want to look up the videos in the headset, below are searches that will work (alternatively, look up my channel, Ramifications Phi, they should be the latest videos):</p> <p>Sleeping God VR</p> <p>Spacetime Elevator VR</p> <p>Build

I get perfectly playable performance but notice that I will get a quick visual stutter, especially if I move side to side. The stutter won’t register in fpsvr or in virtual desktop overlay and the frame times are way below 11ms. Neither vram or memory or chip usage is maxed. </p> <p>What are these unregistered stutters? Are they network packet bursts that don’t register but are enough to screw the pipeline?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been playing through Indiana Jones on my 7800X3D 7900XTX system, and the game runs phenomenally at 4K max settings (minus Path Tracing.) I just got to the Egypt part of the game and recently learned of Luke Ross’s Real VR mod that allows you to play in VR with a controller, and it sounds really good. I’ve heard he doesn’t really support AMD graphics cards with his mods though, is this true? Should I sub to his patreon, or is it not worth it as I’m running a 7900XTX rather than a 4080/4090/5090? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CMDRTragicAllPro"> /u/CMDRTragicAllPro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ifsajl/just_learned_of_luke_rosss_realvr_mod_how_is_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ifsajl/just_learned_of_luke_rosss_realvr_mod_how_is_it/">[comments]</a></span>
