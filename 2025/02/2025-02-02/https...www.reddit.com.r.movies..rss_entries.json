Is she winking because she knows she&#39;s always actually been psychic, or is she winking to us because she&#39;s not, and found out where it was by other means (perhaps overhearing the other two discussing it).</p> <p>I don&#39;t believe we&#39;re ever shown her finding out about it on screen, maybe I&#39;m wrong and if so let me know.

It was a sort of coming of age film, about a boy.<br/> The two key scenes that have stuck with me. The first one, is where he tells his older friends/cousins that he can still convince his mother to take him to the communal bathhouse, (instead of having to go with his father to the mens side) where he can spy on the women.<br/> The second one involves the main boy being given the used chewing gum, of a pretty girl, he then gives the wad of gum to a local pensioner who is slightly obsessed by said girl and saves it in a small tin.<br/> The details are a little fuzzy, but it is some 30yrs since I happened upon it late one night. Hopefully someone can recognise the film from my ramblings.</p> </div>",
