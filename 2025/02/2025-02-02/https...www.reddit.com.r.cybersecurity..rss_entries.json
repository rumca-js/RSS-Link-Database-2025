So this got me wondering about more manual ways of creating passphrases of seemingly random words. I know, I know passphrases are supposed to be truly random, but what if the words are related only by physical or meaningful proximity?</p> <p><strong>Example 1</strong> - Words for a personal trip or experience</p> <p>Cabin Cousin Manhattan Snowboard - I went on a snowboarding trip. I stayed at my cousin&#39;s cabin and we drank manhattans. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t, but it gets the point across. Obviously, the words need to be carefully chosen, Snowboard, lift, lodge, run, diamond, etc are all clearly in the snowsport category couldn&#39;t be used together. But could it be sorta &quot;madlibbed&quot;? Duration, Activity, Food/Drink, Relation, Purchase, What movie did you watch, what game did",
