The game is nearly old enough to drive or vote, and its developers at Riot Games haven\u2019t been shy about applying retcons or reworks to champions or other aspects of the game as needed. Even longtime players can find themselves surprised by these overhauls. For instance, one champion was in the game for 11 years before he was suddenly replaced with someone completely new, but with the same name. The new Viktor has been taken from <em>Arcane</em>, which is much less confusing to new players \u2014 but what happens to longtime fans of a champion when their beloved main character gets replaced with a \u201cbetter\u201d version?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-alig",
