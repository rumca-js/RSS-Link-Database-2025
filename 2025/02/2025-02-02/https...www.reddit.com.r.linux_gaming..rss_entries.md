After trying a bunch of different ones and messing with the terminal in all of them I decided to go with Arch even though I know it’s easily one of the more difficult ones to work with, since I know my way around computers quite a bit better than the average person and can figure out most things I need to.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to play Civ 6 using Proton as the Native version doesn&#39;t have all the content. When I start the game it loads into the main menus fine, but when I create a game it sends me to the &quot;Loading... Please Wait&quot; black screen and doesn&#39;t progress from there. It doesn&#39;t crash as I can still hear the music and the fps doesn&#39;t lower, but it stays on that screen indefinitely.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried using different versions of proton but they all have the same issue. I also have tried various fixes from across the internet but they haven&#39;t worked either.</p> <p>If it&#39;s important: I am using Linux Mint 22.1 with Cinnamon.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Useful-Field-9037"> /u/Useful-Field-9037 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ifpzo7/civ_6_using_proton_wont_load/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/

I know that it is very little information, I remain aware of your questions and I will leave you a little about the hardware - i5 11th, 3050, 32 ram is generally the hardware of the notebook</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Character_Maybe4693"> /u/Character_Maybe4693 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ifp7zt/help_with_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ifp7zt/help_with_linux/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m loving running Overwatch in native Wayland mode! It avoids a bunch of issues I was having with X11 compatibility options.</p> <p>I worked out how to set up Wine 10.0 in NixOS to get native Wayland support so I thought I&#39;d share. The short version is to get Wine from NixOS unstable. The long version is that the easiest way I&#39;ve found to run games using a Wine package from Nix is using Lutris, and here&#39;s how I set it up:</p> <p>To get a complete Wine setup for Lutris use <code>wineWowPackages</code> - for example <code>wineWowPackages.stableFull</code>. The <code>Full</code> variant includes <code>wine-mono</code> which you&#39;ll probably want. Like I mentioned you&#39;ll need to get the Wine package from unstable, and the easiest way to do that is to install Lutris from unstable as well.</p> <p>I have an <a href="https://github.com/hallettj/home.nix/blob/40cfc9f7c885a59946d77c9bf8e3a18be43364aa/overlays/default.nix#L34">overlay</a
