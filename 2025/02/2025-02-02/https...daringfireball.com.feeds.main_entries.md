<p>A delight, as usual.</p>

<p>(My one suggestion for 2025’s list: <a href="https://www.mydadschips.com/">My Dad’s Chips</a>. Holy hell are these good potato chips. I’ve got a particular weakness for the French Onion ones. Chef’s kiss. <a href="https://www.mydadschips.com/find-us">Distribution</a> seems mostly limited to the northeast for now.)</p>

<p>Interesting <a href="https://wholesome.computer/@mattpat/113921289516156105">detail</a> with the latest update to Apple’s app for learning and tinkering with Swift: it’s now named Playground, singular, not Playgrounds, plural. I’m not going to argue that much should be made of the name change, but I like it. The app is the playground — a place for playing with Swift — not a factory for making playgrounds.</p>

  <p>Mastodon clients have become the new UI playground in the same way
that Twitter clients used to be. But what I can’t wrap my head
around is the business decision of developers to lean into
Mastodon clients versus Bluesky ones. Fortunately some progress
seems to be starting to be made with apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740792786">PinkSky</a>
that replicate the Instagram experience but using Bluesky as the
backend. There are also a handful of clients like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6466340923">Skeets</a>
and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/graysky-a-bluesky-client/id6448234181">GraySky</a>, but nothing that approaches the quality of
some Mastodon clients or the legendary Twitter clients of old.
They’re okay, but they’re not worth dropping the official client.
Other apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1666230916">OpenVibe</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475002485">Reeder</a> are de
