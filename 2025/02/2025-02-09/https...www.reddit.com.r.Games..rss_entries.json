        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Wagotabi is an educational RPG that teaches you Japanese from scratch. </p> <p>As you progress through the adventure, English is gradually replaced by Japanese, until almost all content (dialogues, quests, etc.) is fully in Japanese. Every aspect of the language\u2014characters, vocabulary, grammar, and conjugation\u2014is introduced progressively and always in context, with quests and dialogues to fully immerse you in the language. You will also explore real Japanese geography throughout the adventure and learn about Japan\u2019s culture and history.</p> <p>We plan to release Wagotabi on Steam in 2025 (likely mid-2025). It will be a cross-platform game (Steam, iOS, Android) with cloud saves, allowing you to share your progress between devices. A demo is available on Steam, Itch.io, and mobile.</p> <p>Recently, we were honored to have Mike Learns Japanese showcase the demo version of Wagotabi on his new channel! We&#39;re excited to share his video here in the hope",
