<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Several years ago my parents got divorced, at the time nobody would tell me and my siblings anything. Eventually it came out and it was so difficult and unbelievable in the beginning to understand , but overtime listening to my dad, asking questions, and doing research. I am so glad that my dad was able to finally be herself and comfortable in her own skin. It can be so challenging though dealing with the comments and things people say that do not support it especially if it’s your own family. I worry about her a lot especially nowadays as there’s so much hate and disapproval right now. At times it feels like I don’t have that male role model in my life that I feel I’ve always been searching for and seems like my dad is way more connected with my sister now which I understand. I talk to my dad everyday though to keep that connection and contact and I love her so much. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

Cis gender men will identify as trans man to go into women&#39;s even though they were never assigned female at birth. This creates an entire new problem by their logic.
