Eventually it came out and it was so difficult and unbelievable in the beginning to understand , but overtime listening to my dad, asking questions, and doing research. I am so glad that my dad was able to finally be herself and comfortable in her own skin. It can be so challenging though dealing with the comments and things people say that do not support it especially if it\u2019s your own family. I worry about her a lot especially nowadays as there\u2019s so much hate and disapproval right now. At times it feels like I don\u2019t have that male role model in my life that I feel I\u2019ve always been searching for and seems like my dad is way more connected with my sister now which I understand. I talk to my dad everyday though to keep that connection and contact and I love her so much. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
