She founded Aaron\nSwartz Day in 2013, an annual hackathon and tribute held on his\nbirthday. There\u2019s now an Aaron Swartz Institute in Brazil, a\ndocumentary, multiple books and podcasts\u2009\u2014\u2009even an Aaron Swartz\nmemecoin (\u201cDo not buy,\u201d she warned).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aaron, I know, would have laughed at that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Twitch and a partner at Y\nCombinator, was one of the few people who knew Swartz personally.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s become a symbol, he would approve of that,\u201d he\nshared, his voice slightly breaking. \u201cI really miss him.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I miss him too. Man. But I find it weird that there were only \u201cfew people who knew him\u201d at the event. So many people knew him. That\u2019s part of what made Aaron <",

There\u2019s a strong case to be made that these are the two best teams in the NFL this season. And without question they\u2019re two of the top four (I\u2019d add the Bills and Ravens). If you\u2019re only a casual fan, you might think that happens every year. A championship game, ideally, would always feature two of the very best teams. But that\u2019s often not the way it works out. This year it did. What\u2019s similar about both the Chiefs and Eagles is that both teams are full of surprises and tricks\u2009\u2014\u2009they often do things no one would expect. But even more often,",
