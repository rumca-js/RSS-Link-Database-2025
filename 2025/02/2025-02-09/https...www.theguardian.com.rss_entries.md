<p>From jokes about Tesco meal deals to depictions of life’s most precious moments, Jack Rooke’s semi-fictionalisation of his student years is back for the final time. It’s a beautiful, heartbreaking watch</p><p>The last episode of Big Boys finished on a note of almost transcendent devastation. From the very beginning, this tale of male bonding and sexual expedition – inspired by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/feb/17/on-my-radar-jack-rooke-cultural-highlights">the comedian Jack Rooke</a>’s university days – existed in the shadow of grief. The first thing we learn about Jack, our semi-fictional protagonist, is that his dad, Laurie, died when Jack was a teenager. Loss hovered over the show’s chronicle of the sensitive, sheltered Jack’s student scrapes, as he formed an unlikely friendship with his laddish, socially assured roommate Danny while struggling to find his feet in Brent uni’s gay scene.</p><p>Yet it wasn’t until the final instalment of series two that we wer

<p>This beloved cold-case drama still has a dry sense of humour, but its attempt to wade into the culture wars was not a good idea. Its tackling of politics is starting to feel very ham-fisted</p><p>For five series, Unforgotten was my go-to comfort television. Yes, the crime drama is always about a grisly murder, and every season begins with the gruesome discovery of remains that have been buried for years or even decades. And yes, there are plenty of scenes with body parts laid out on mortuary tables, being picked over by pathologists who say things such as, “this artery does show signs of gaping”, as if they’ve just won the lottery. But in its combination of strong casts, ample twists and the inevitable dispensation of justice, it always felt soothing, somehow. It is occasionally workmanlike, but reliably solid.</p><p>As it reaches its sixth season, though, I worry that the wheels are coming off. The structure is largely the same every time – another reason it is so comforting, per

<p>As Spurs’ head coach ploughs on, he has no choice but to use his best young players during damaging run of defeats</p><p>The midfield press was non-existent, Morgan Rogers carving past white shirts before releasing Jacob Ramsey to shoot. The goalkeeping of Antonin Kinsky bordered on appalling but the travelling Tottenham fans who filled Villa Park’s North Stand had another culprit for the opening goal.</p><p>It usually takes longer than 57&nbsp;seconds to be voiced but “Daniel&nbsp;Levy, get out of our club” – or variants thereof – will be heard at&nbsp;every Tottenham game until, well, Daniel Levy gets out of Tottenham.

## Calum Ferrie the hero as Queen’s Park shock Rangers with win at Ibrox

<p>Second-tier Queen’s Park produced one of the biggest shocks in Scottish Cup history to eliminate Rangers in the pair’s last-16 tie at Ibrox. The result, which is likely to have severe implications for the Rangers manager, Philippe Clement, marks the first time since 1966-67 the club has been knocked out of the Scottish Cup by lower-league opposition. Calum Ferrie, the heroic Queen’s goalkeeper, saved a stoppage-time James Tavernier penalty on an afternoon of high drama.</p><p>Queen’s Park last defeated Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie in 1882, at that point the second round of the “Glasgow and Suburbs” section. Scotland’s oldest league club will take a place in the quarter-final draw for the first time since 1983. Their match-winner in 2025 was Seb Drozd, who danced inside Jefté after Rangers failed to clear a 69th-minute corner, the substitute then slotting calmly beyond Liam Kelly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/09/rangers-queens-park-scottish-cup-fifth-

Last week, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5632daa5-2908-4d21-8090-54a0d2232c3a?shareType=nongift">reignited a debate</a> about who should be in charge of the monetary system that controls a country’s interest rates.

<p>Spiced aubergine and sweet rhubarb are two superb warming delicacies of the winter season</p><p>I have made many a dinner from a good rummage in the fridge. This time, a couple of less-than-perfect aubergines and a paper bag of tomatoes were turned into a thoroughly satisfying stew, the aubergines fried separately, then added to a turmeric and cumin-scented sauce. The spicing was mild, just warming enough for a nippy winter’s evening, and a last-minute stirring-in of yoghurt and spoonful of crème fraîche brought a silky, almost luxurious note to my fridge-find. A shot of lime at the end made our supper sing.</p><p>When I think about it, there is almost always an aubergine or two in the fridge. Like butternut squash, I buy them without having a plan.

It celebrated the fact that Kurti has succeeded where his predecessors had failed, in tightening the control of the Albanian-majority government over a rebellious Serb area on its northern border.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/09/kosovo-goes-to-the-polls-as-the-shadow-of-trump-looms-large">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Writer and therapist Owen O’Kane believes we have become addicted to feeling anxious. Here, he explains how he learned to manage his fears</p><p>Key work events make me anxious. They give me chest pain, a churning stomach and disrupted sleep; my thoughts run through all the mistakes I could make and replay every bad experience in my past. Why put myself through this, I reason, which inevitably means that when, say, a high-stakes meeting is on the horizon, those feelings are worse, more intense, more prolonged. It’s a vicious cycle and one I admit early on when interviewing the anxiety expert Owen O’Kane.</p><p>O’Kane doesn’t seem surprised and why should he be? I bet everyone tells him about their anxiety.

Tippetts’s pictures have now become a monograph that captures a pivotal moment in the history of that ever-changing part of London, when second-generation Bangladeshis were starting to assert their cultural identity, and to feel fully at home.</p><p>In this image, the photographer recalls, “young Bangladeshi women, known as ‘sakhis’, friends of the bride, had gat

  £7.50-£11.50, large dishes £9.50-£23.50, desserts £6.50, wines from £23, Cobra £6.30</strong></p><p>At the top of the menu at the Great Indian, a new and thoroughly delightful food pub in London’s Archway, there’s a set of slogans of a sort guaranteed to make my teeth itchy. It says things like “comfy”, “social” and “vibe dining”. I looked up the last one. Apparently, it means the place is, y’know, nice. We can all get behind nice. It was, however, another phrase that really stood out. It said “Indian influenced”. The Great Indian is owned by Aman Dhir who already has a takeaway of the same name in Hackney where they serve chicken tikka, seekh kebabs, aloo gobi and the rest.

Instead, smart meters have become an emblem for the energy industry’s poor reputation as the costs of rolling them out approaches £20bn and the government project lags years behind its original schedule.</p><p>Consumers who have the devices still face surprise bills, too, as some faulty meters go into “dumb” mode, where they stop automatically sending regular meter readings to energy suppliers, leaving households to send readings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/09/a-mess-energy-suppliers-face-scramble-to-install-smart-meters-in-uk-homes">Continue reading...</a>
