<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I&#39;m looking for just as the title suggests, beautifully written, pieces of literature. I&#39;m looking for a book that I will read and will think about after, maybe even change my view on life. I love books that are written in a way where you can analyze every other line. It matters not the culture or the time period the book was written in. I don&#39;t mind whether the books are depressing, philosophical, or just appreciative of life. I love them all and i&#39;m open to any recommendations. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Notevenhxre"> /u/Notevenhxre </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ils9k9/beautifully_written_literature_about_artists_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ils9k9/beautifully_written_literature_about_artists_or/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read Loveless by Alice Oseman like years ago and I loved the scene where it was like a love confession scene between two characters but it was only in a platonic way. I also enjoy relationships between characters like Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, which yeah you could read something romantic into it, but what no one can deny is the deep companionship and trust existing between them.</p> <p>So, books depicting a deep platonic relationship between the two main characters. Gender doesn&#39;t matter. I would prefer the characters to be adults, not teenagers. I&#39;m open for almost anything. I don&#39;t look for YA (even though I realize Loveless is in that category) and so called &quot;lit fiction&quot;.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am looking for books on human psychology since a significant part of our lives is spent around people, whether at home or in the workplace. Human behavior can reveal a lot about an individual if observed carefully. I’m not advocating for being judgmental, but understanding human behavior can enhance conversations, encourage meaningful interactions, and help recognize that how others respond to you may not always be a reflection of your own actions.</p> <p>I’ve come across a few recommended books, such as <em>Read People Like a Book</em>, <em>The Laws of Human Nature</em>, and <em>The Courage to Be Disliked</em>. If you’ve read any of them, I’d love to hear your thoughts, and I’m open to new suggestions as well</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Horseman099"> /u/Horseman099 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iladgx/looking_for_a_book_on_human_psychology/">[

Ofc I wouldn&#39;t deface a book I&#39;m borrowing, so I resorted to just clicking pics of the quotes I liked, and ended up with a few hundred pics taken lol. So against my philosophy, I kinda wanna buy those books now so I can highlight and annotate them to my heart&#39;s content</p> <p>So I wanna ask for any more books like those, that are so good and rereadable and quotable and highlightable that you&#39;d rather have your own copy of it than read borrowed.
