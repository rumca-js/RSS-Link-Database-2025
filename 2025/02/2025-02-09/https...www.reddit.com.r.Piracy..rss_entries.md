## Is there a way to record and reproduce disc read errors?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have the following simple idea: You rip an entire disc and save all the read disc data in an image file along with the information which addresses could not be read. Later, you mount the disc image as a virtual disc with a special program (driver) that reproduces the disc read errors according to the information saved in the image file. So that in the end the virtual disc gives read errors at the same addresses as the original disc. </p> <p>Boom, all offline CD/DVD game&#39;s DRM defeated and many hours of crackers&#39; work rendered useless with one simple trick. Surely I can&#39;t be the first one with this idea, right? Is that what Alcohol 120% does? Isn&#39;t there some free software that does the same? Because Alcohol 120% is this weird charged malware thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Abrissbirne66"> /u/Abrissbirne66 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/
