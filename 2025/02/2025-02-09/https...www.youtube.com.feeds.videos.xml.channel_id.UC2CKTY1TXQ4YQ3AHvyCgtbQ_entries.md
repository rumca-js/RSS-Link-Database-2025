I've been thinking more about solo play games - not just because they're fun, but maybe even because of some battle reports, too? I want to talk about what you think of solo games and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
