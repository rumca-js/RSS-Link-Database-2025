<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I know this is probably a frequently asked question around here but I got myself a PC with an NVIDIA RTX 3080 and an Intel I5 12th cpu I really have liked using Linux in the past and checked out the proton db website for comparability Now I really don&#39;t like windows and how much space it takes on my PC also I really enjoy Linux but my and my friends play a ton of online games together not any that use kernel level anticheats (We mostly play counter strike 2) which I know is nativey supported and we started marvel Rivals which I&#39;ve heard works I&#39;m a little worried about switching cause I&#39;m just worried that not everything will work all the time I know the obvious awnser here is probably just suck it up and stick with windows but does anyone know of any problems just running games on Linux (I usually play single player games just finished half life 2 and playing through 1 now)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&#39;m experiencing problems playing wow classic on linux. Been playing wow on linux for 2 months now and had some minor problems that i was able to solve. But since yesterday my game has been unplayable at times. I would get disconnected from wow and then have problems logging in and staying logged in. it would take me 5-10 minutes to actually get inside the game again, only to be disconnected in less than a minute. This cycle continued for over 2 hours and then fixed itself. I tried rebooting, resetting my router, clearing cache, terminal commands like &quot;sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=128&quot; with no luck. Only solution i did not try was use a VPN. I know its a niche question since not many play on linux but would love to hear a solution for this apart from running it on windows :D.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dontfeeddirk"> /u/dontfeeddirk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.r

The installer was complaining about not finding Mesa RADV drivers. I updated my entire machine, Mesa and went through the Vulkan page on Arch wiki and install everything the page recommended. It seems that the installer only launches when I export DISABLE_LAYER_AMD_SWITCHABLE_GRAPHICS_1=1. Exporting this allowed me to run the installer and even launched the game immediately after installation. I rebooted my machine and tried to launch the game but it would not. I export the variable again and tried it again. The game logs showed that it was complaining about the RADV drivers. After searching for quite some time, I tried to relaunch the installer and it did. It seems that I&#39;m only able to launch the game if I export the variable and run the installer (even though the game is already installed). Wha
