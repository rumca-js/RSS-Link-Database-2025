<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s very, very dumb - but my god this film looks great. Michael Bay gets a lot of flack but boy was he making some great looking movies - to deliver this level of CG in 1998 was a feat in and of its self, but aside from that, every shot has thought behind it, it genuinely looks excellent throughout. Contrast, depth of field, interesting composition... </p> <p>I think what&#39;s happened recently is that big budget movies are being directed by people with almost zero experience and every single creative decision is being left for post production. That&#39;s why movies are &quot;flat&quot; right now. </p> <p>At least a few years back our daft, big budget nonsense was made by people who had some visual flair. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crumble-bee"> /u/crumble-bee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ilo65c/armageddon_looks_amazing/">[link]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I watched a movie called &quot;The Score&quot; from 2001. Simply put, it&#39;s a heist movie with Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Edward Norton, and Angela Bassett. </p> <p>Solid movie with a star-studded cast but the trailer is absolute horse shit.</p> <p>First of all, the trailer makes it seem like all 4 actors are part of the heist but that ain&#39;t the case. Brando is an information broker. He&#39;s not really part of the actual heist. </p> <p>Bassett is just there to be DeNiro&#39;s love interest. She&#39;s barely in the movie and knows next to nothing about the actual heist. </p> <p>And secondly, there&#39;s a twist in the movie that they straight up spoil in the trailer. </p> <p>An absolutely horrible trailer for an otherwise good movie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RenzyWenzy"> /u/RenzyWenzy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ilnm8x/whats_the_most_mislea

## What's a movie that you don't like, but still respect?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a pretty big Star Trek fan. Actually, a massive one. I love so much about the franchise, and can find something to enjoy in most of the different shows/movies, even if they&#39;re generally not well regarded.</p> <p>The fourth movie though, despite being an even number and apparently quite popular, just doesn&#39;t do anything for me. I dont know if it&#39;s the departure from the usual space opera setting, the over laboured fish-out-of-water gag of the crew going back in time, or the heavy handedness of the environmental message, but for one reason or another I just cant get on board with it.</p> <p>Having said all that, I dont hate it. I can see why people like it - it takes a risk in changing up the setting, the individual performances are generally pretty good, and the &quot;save the whales&quot; message is pretty hard to take issue with. </p> <p>So overall - I dont like it, but I do <em>respect</em> it. Curious if other folks have movies

## The Blind Side is a messed up movie

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe a year ago I heard the true story of Michael Orr without having watched The Blind Side.</p> <p>In the true story, he’s an extroverted, star football player going to a prestigious school. He’s living with family members when an assistant coach says he could stay with him in his fancy house because it will be easier for him to go to school.</p> <p>Well, The Blind Side is on TV and it’s insane. They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.</p> <p>This has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what’s on film I’ve seen (or at least know about).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive_Way8674"> /u/Apprehensive_Way8674 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1il9xlb/the_blind_side_is_a_messed_up_movie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.redd

Until now, the only way to watch it has been to buy/rent a hard copy or find a low quality version online.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of William Friedken, 80s neo-noir, and stylized crime thrillers a la Thief and Heat then you NEED to see this movie. It’s meticulously crafted, oozes coolness from start to finish, and features one of cinema’s very best car chases.</p> <p>Make sure to watch with the volume on high to get the full oomph of Wang Chung’s soundtrack.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/badassj00"> /u/badassj00 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1il46zd/to_live_and_die_in_la_finally_streaming_about/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1il46zd/to_live_and_die_in_la_finally_streaming_about/">[comments]</a>
