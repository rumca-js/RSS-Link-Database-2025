<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>New to usenet and just purchased NewsHosting, now I&#39;m looking at indexers and I see a lot of posts recommending more than one. Is this really necessary? I was thinking of picking up NZBgeek - should I also get a free one to go along with it, or will it be fine alone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Elant"> /u/Elant </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ilht9r/is_more_than_one_indexer_really_necessary/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ilht9r/is_more_than_one_indexer_really_necessary/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is absolutely no info on it anywhere (aside from one 3-years-od reddit post) and yet, it does what it says, which is unlimited downloads with no cap for free. Ive tried it a couple of times and had no issues with getting download from as well old and new nzb files. and its totally free. Apparently it was supposed to be 30days trial but after the trial I was able to simply do the trial again? It all seems weird to me but, somehow, not fishy. It looks kinda like a passion project? I thought that someone started developing it and servers are still alive or smth. Honestly, I would be glad if anyone told more on their background and their legitness as the lack of any info makes me extra eager. The site is <a href="http://magicnzb.com">magicnzb.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ActCurious9216"> /u/ActCurious9216 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ilhnog/does

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back after a decade (RIP Giganews lol), often seeing failed downloads now when historically that was not the case. I am seeing that people now alternate between providers. I am running Eweka which seems to be great aside from the entities that make certain articles not work.. What provider are folks using when Eweka cannot download it but a block plan can, and why does that work? I tried reading through a few posts, but still lost. TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Beno169"> /u/Beno169 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ilhixg/eli5_why_can_block_plans_download_articles_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ilhixg/eli5_why_can_block_plans_download_articles_that/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure this is not intentional so not trying to shame nzb.su - I paid for VIP with BTC. After the transaction was paid I got a message that it was only a &#39;partial payment&#39; looks like it was .02 cents short b/c of the transaction fee on the BTC network. Trying to reach out to the admins but you can only send a support message if you&#39;re a VIP member... Do they have a presence here at all? Anyone have a suggestion as to how to proceed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/elroypaisley"> /u/elroypaisley </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1il2qzh/paid_for_nzbsu_but_dont_have_access_support_is/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1il2qzh/paid_for_nzbsu_but_dont_have_access_support_is/">[comments]</a></span>
