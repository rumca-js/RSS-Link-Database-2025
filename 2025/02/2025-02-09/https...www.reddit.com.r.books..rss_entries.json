The book is divided into three main parts, and Part 1 (which takes up about a quarter of the book) feels more like a primer on running a zoo and on the psychology of zoo animals, mixed in with a philosophical and theological consideration of comparative religions. The main character who tells the story is a young boy named Pi Patel, whose father runs a zoo, so he has lots to say about that. He also explores several religions, and ends up becoming a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim all at once.

Oh boy, was I wrong! Why is this not a talked about, analysed, and well loved classic? The writing, the themes (youth, fashion of a certain time, relationships, depression, abuse, hope, love), there&#39;s so much to unpack and think about. I haven&#39;t yet finished the book, yet I felt compelled to write this half review and half pleading request for someone to read this book so that I can know what others think of it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CoolJ56\"> /u/CoolJ56 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
