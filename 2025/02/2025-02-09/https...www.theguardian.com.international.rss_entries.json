It is something to which the peoples of the Chagos Islands and Gaza can attest.</p><p>Last year, Britain finalised an agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/britain-to-return-chagos-islands-to-mauritius-ending-years-of-dispute\">to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius</a>, a shabby deal at the end of a sordid history of British rule. Much of the criticism of the deal is equally shabby.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
