## Does anyone actually finish classic books? Or do we all just pretend we did?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Look, I’m not saying classic books aren’t important, but let’s be real—has anyone actually read every page? Or is this one of those books where we all just nod and say, “Oh yes, a masterpiece,” while secretly skimming half of it (or, let’s be honest, not finishing at all)?</p> <p>I’ll admit it: I’ve never read <em>Ulysses</em>. Despite being fluent in Russian, I’ve tried multiple times to read <em>War and Peace</em> and just <strong>can’t finish it</strong>. I barely made it through <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (also in Russian), and that was a struggle. (<em>Maybe because I was forced to read massive Russian classics as a teenager, and it left a permanent scar. Who knows?</em>)</p> <p>Some other classics I’ve never read, <em>Don Quixote, The Great Gatsby, Brave New World</em>, <em>The Art of War</em> (Read halfway, then skimmed the rest.)</p> <p>So tell me—<strong>was it worth it?</strong> Did you actually finish classic books, or did you just push

Has anyone found a reliable way to tell if closed or open door? Reviews aren&#39;t always good. I don&#39;t mind sexual tension and&#39;build up&#39; (intense make out scenes are ok) but most sex scenes make me cringe.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>During these dark days filled with resentment and blame, I find myself thinking frequently of Harry Mulish’s book “The Assault.”</p> <p>For those who don’t know, this is the basic plot of the book: </p> <p>In the dead of night during WW2 in the occupied Netherlands, the Dutch resistance executes a particularly cruel Nazi collaborator in one of the streets of Haarlem. This happens to be the street of 12-year-old Anton Steenwijk. Alarmed by the shots, Anton and his family can see the dead body of the collaborator right in front of their neighbors’ house. In panic, these neighbors run out of the house and, after some hesitation about which direction to choose, carry the collaborator’s body to the front of Anton’s house.</p> <p>When the Nazis arrive, their reprisal is swift and brutal. Anton is thrown into a truck. His house is set on fire. Anton hears some screaming and machine gun fire. Later, he learns that his brother and parents were executed on the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This post is inspired by a comment I left on someone’s post in another community talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/classicliterature/s/0w7tUJSPFe">modernized vs literal translation</a>. I love talking about The Stranger by Albert Camus and using it as an example of how much of a difference the translation makes! </p> <p>The two most well known translations of this book are the Stuart Gilbert translation and the Matthew Ward translation. A lot of the time, Gilbert’s is recognized as the British English translation while Ward’s is recognized as the American English translation. (I want to take a minute to note that I have only read the Ward translation in full, and only excerpts of the Gilbert translation.) </p> <p>There are two really important differences between their translations that I’ve seen people recognize. The first, being the use of “Mother” vs. “Maman,” and the second being the order of words and word choice. </p> <p>When it c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if the title sounds mean. </p> <p>A person can explain in a structured, understandable way why he liked/disliked the book, and even if you do not agree with his opinion, you accept it. But there may be those reviews, reading which you have a lot of questions about whether this person has read the book at all. </p> <p>For example, I can include reviews of Lolita. Yes, those infamous reviews where a little girl is called a dirty hoe because she seduced an adult man. After all, this book is not about an unreliable narrator, but a straightforward story about a &quot;poor man&quot; &quot;suffering&quot; from a little girl (sarcasm).</p> <p>By stupid review, I don&#39;t mean those that don&#39;t match your opinion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mystery5009"> /u/mystery5009 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ildfab/what_silly_book_reviews_have_you_found/">[link]</

## The man who mistook his wife for the hat: Do you think separating the savant twin was the right thing to do?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read the book a few months ago, and it was really perspective-changing. All the stories are filled with new insights and make you think about the wonders of the brain.</p> <p>But I keep wondering about the savant twins. Was it right to separate them? The world of numbers they built around themselves was such a big part of who they were. I do understand that they needed to adapt to society on their own, but still! It is sad that they had to lose so much of themselves just to conform to the idea of &quot;normal&quot; when the disorder itself was such a big part of their identity.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Classroom8460"> /u/Icy_Classroom8460 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ilbes5/the_man_who_mistook_his_wife_for_the_hat_do_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ilbes5/the_man_who_mistook_his_wife_for_the_h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p> <p>Several descriptions of Yann Martel&#39;s book &quot;Life is Pi&quot; said that is &quot;a fantasy adventure novel&quot;. So I came in expecting some kind of fantasy story, and those familiar with the book will understand why I found myself extremely puzzled when I began reading it. The book is divided into three main parts, and Part 1 (which takes up about a quarter of the book) feels more like a primer on running a zoo and on the psychology of zoo animals, mixed in with a philosophical and theological consideration of comparative religions. The main character who tells the story is a young boy named Pi Patel, whose father runs a zoo, so he has lots to say about that. He also explores several religions, and ends up becoming a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim all at once. Definitely no fantasy yet.</p> <p>Just when I was feeling comfortable with this unexpected content and style, I arrived at Part 2 of the nov

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading this book Summertime by Charlotte Bingham. I found this very accidentally after reading another book Season by the same author and looking up more books because I really enjoyed Season. I ended up picking this one solely because of the title as it&#39;s almost summer where I live. I expected to find a light breezy summer read, which I would read once and forget next week. Oh boy, was I wrong! Why is this not a talked about, analysed, and well loved classic? The writing, the themes (youth, fashion of a certain time, relationships, depression, abuse, hope, love), there&#39;s so much to unpack and think about. I haven&#39;t yet finished the book, yet I felt compelled to write this half review and half pleading request for someone to read this book so that I can know what others think of it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CoolJ56"> /u/CoolJ56 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.re
