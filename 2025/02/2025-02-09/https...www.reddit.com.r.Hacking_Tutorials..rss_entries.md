<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to create a P2P chat app with E2E encryption for my portfolio, what features would be interesting/ necessary for it? So far Iv just thought about being able to use one chat at a time and not being able to reuse them. All users have IDs and to chat you have to know the other person‚Äôs ID and the room ID(unless you are the creator of the room) to start a chat. Please let me know if you have any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/darkurlzz"> /u/darkurlzz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ilrotb/p2p_chat_features/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ilrotb/p2p_chat_features/">[comments]</a></span>
