Swartz Day in 2013, an annual hackathon and tribute held on his
birthday. There’s now an Aaron Swartz Institute in Brazil, a
documentary, multiple books and podcasts — even an Aaron Swartz
memecoin (“Do not buy,” she warned).</p>

There’s a strong case to be made that these are the two best teams in the NFL this season. And without question they’re two of the top four (I’d add the Bills and Ravens). If you’re only a casual fan, you might think that happens every year. A championship game, ideally, would always feature two of the very best teams. But that’s often not the way it works out. This year it did. What’s similar about both the Chiefs and Eagles is that both teams are full of surprises and tricks — they often do things no one would expect. But even more often,
