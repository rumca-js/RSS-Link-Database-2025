To demonstrate this, they created a microcode patch that forces the chips to always return 4 when asked for a random number. Beyond simply allowing Google and others to customize AMD chips for both beneficial and potentially malicious purposes, this capability also undermines AMD's secure encrypted virtualization and root-of-trust security mechanisms.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=How+To+Make+Any+AMD+Zen+CPU+Always+Generate+4+As+a+Random+Number%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F02%2F09%2F2021244%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=h",

        "description": "\"Can you skydive continuously without landing...?\" asks Red Bull. Imagine jumping out of a helicopter, \"only to latch onto a speeding plane in mid-air and soar back up into the sky.\"\n\n\nHarnessing the plane's momentum, [skydiver Max Manow] soared out of the canyon, embarking on what he calls his \"endless skydive\", a manoeuvre that potentially could be done continuously without him ever needing to land... \n\nAfter exiting a helicopter, he manoeuvred his wingsuit to close the gap with a nosediving Cessna 182, piloted by Luke Aikins. Precision was key: Manow attached himself to a hook on the aircraft as the plane descended, allowing him to ascend back to a safe altitude of 2,500 feet before releasing into another freefall... Manow spent five months training, including sessions in a Stockholm wind tunnel, to master the techniques needed for mid-air connection. Meanwhile, Aikins modified his aircraft to ensure the feat was safe and repeatable. \nSkydiver Max Manow's goal was to develop a man",

        "description": "Keynotes at this year's FOSDEM included free AI models and systemd, reports Heise.de &mdash; and also a progress report from Miguel Ojeda, supervisor of the Rust integration in the Linux kernel.\n\nOnly eight people remain in the core team around Rust for Linux... Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. \nThe reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: \n\n- \"2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers...\" &mdash; Daniel Almedia \n\n- \"I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time.\" &mdash; Andrea Righi\n\n - \"[T]h",

But at the same time YouTube is running ads on TikTok, reports Bloomberg, targeting TikTok content creators in \"an effort to lure these valuable users to the Google-owned rival and capitalize on TikTok's uncertain future.\" \n\nOne of YouTube's ads even received over a thousand likes, with Bloomberg calling it that TikTok \"is willing to accept ad dollars from one of its fiercest competitors promoting a message aimed at undercutting its business.\"\n\n\nYouTube is the latest TikTok competitor to try to capitalize on the app's looming US ban, which could go into effect in early April. Meta Platforms Inc.'s Instagram announced a new video editing tool in January, and X also teased a new video tab as part of an effort to win over TikTok's content creators... \n\nGoogle would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a ban in the US. Both its flagship video service YouTube and its TikTok copycat, YouTube Shorts, would likely see an uptick in traffic if ",
