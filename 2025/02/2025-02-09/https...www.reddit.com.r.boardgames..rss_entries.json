I wanted to know if there are still any players? </p> <p>As a duo, we successfully completed a campaign in normal mode with Legolas (scout) and Elena (musician). This duo is absolutely cheated!! Particularly with the acceleration of the scout which allows you to teleport another character to the square, and which combines incredibly well with the basic power of Legolas. What are your favorite duets? </p> <p>Conversely, we started a campaign with Gimli (guardian) and Beravor (scout) and it&#39;s a horror. We are thinking of abandoning it. </p> <p>I have the impression that the game (as a duo at least) is infeasible without Legolas given that he is the only one who can attack from a distance early. What do you think?? </p> <p>Looking forward to discussing the game more broadly with you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

Are you able to use dice to generate concentration on the final turn, or are you only supposed to use 1 die on the brakes and the other dice are not used on this final turn? </p> <p>I know that you have to be facing straight, all landing gear and flaps open, no traffic on runway, etc. </p> <p>For example, my wife and I were just playing, we had everything clear, we both rolled, but we did not have low enough dice to brake, so we used our dice to gain concentration which allowed me to turn my 3 in to a 1 and she placed a 2, meaning we had less than 4 (we only had 2 brakes open) and we successfully landed.</p> <p>Hope this makes sense. </p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Kakal </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

The issue is how people play it that kinda takes me back and hard to adjust.</p> <p>I am a fun and competitive board gamer. I think the best games are when everyone competes hard without being mean and the games end up close. Ticket to ride is a great example of this for my rotation as everyone is very competitive but it is fun when people are fighting for similar routes. That being said for C (tired of typing out Carcassonne a million times) everyone I have played with makes it a team game of making the board feel complete or putting tiles where they are missing. So instead of putting pieces in places to help themselves start new cities or new roads they help other players",

But, recently I&#39;ve been playing Food Chain Magnate with someone (2 players) and really loving it! I realized I actually love the fact that both my actions and the opponent&#39;s can change the board so much that we need to react and adapt our strategy. I don&#39;t mind the meanness because I feel it happens because of a less than optimal play I make.</p> <p>Thinking about it more, I feel the reason I don&#39;t like 3 players+ high interaction games is because I don&#39;t like the negotiation part. I really don&#39;t like convincing other who to attack and I also don&#39;t like it when others argue who I should attack. I feel the long argument on who&#39;s actually ahead is really tiring.

Meanwhile, Birmingham introduces beer, variable market demands, and additional industries, which force players to adapt more each game.</p> <p>For those who have played both, do you feel that Lancashire becomes too repetitive over multiple plays? Or does the player interaction and competition for key locations keep it fresh?
