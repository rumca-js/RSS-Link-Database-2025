I don’t want to say anything too obvious here, but the further we get into the MCU, the more stuff happens. And the closer we get to the end of a phase some Marvel projects find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to tie up a ton of loose threads in service of a broader plot. With Fan Four and Doomsday just around the corner technically ringing in a whole new phase, Captain America: Brave New World seems to be in that exact situation.
 
The events that have led us here go all the way back to 2008 and are now scattered across Disney+ series and movies alike, and not necessarily in a good way. So, here follows, a messy account of all the loose ends that wound up on Sam Wilson’s to-do list.
