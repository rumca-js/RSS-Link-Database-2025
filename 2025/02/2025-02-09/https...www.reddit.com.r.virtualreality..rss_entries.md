## Mapping VR buttons to joy-con

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using the quest 2 with the Link cable on steamVR and basically I&#39;m trying to get the joy-con to use the buttons for the left quest controller while the left controller stays with the motion... I&#39;ve tried a few things but haven&#39;t really made any progress. I have OVR, betterjoy and driver4vr, but haven&#39;t really found what I&#39;m looking for. Reason being I have a prosthetic left hand and can&#39;t push the buttons on the left controller without using my right hand, so instead of taking apart a quest controller to add the buttons on the right side, which I figured would be tricky because the power would have to run to both sides so they think it&#39;s the same controller, I ended up modeling and 3D printing and attachment for my right quest controller so I can slide a joy-con onto it and press the buttons easily. I figured mapping VR buttons onto a different controller shouldn&#39;t be an issue as you can do that kind of thing n

What I&#39;m not really sure is what kind of cpu I should get, an x3d or not, and before immediately choosing it because it&#39;s objectively better for gaming it got me thinking. Vr is using very high resolutions, and all the benchmarks give x3d a solid advantage at low res high fps scenarios and games which I never play. And not only that, can vr benefit from the higher cache but less cores? Or more cores and less cache is better for vr? Does it worth spending the extra money on the x3d? Or they could be saved or spent better on a different part?</p> <p>TLDR cpu with more cache and less cores, or more cores and less cache for Vr?</p> <p>Thanks everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/prod18557"> /u/p

## The new Contractors Showdown Exfil game seems to be the best VR multiplayer shooter by miles right now. Are you playing?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Contractors showdown has existed a while, but they just released a new Exfil game which is amazing. Can’t believe they didn’t charge for it. It’s a game mode within Showdown. </p> <p>How aware is the community of this game? At least in my eyes, it’s the best multiplayer shooter by miles. </p> <p>Huge skill curve (which I think is a good thing), open world, collect loot and build your hideout type of game. Not ultra fast paced. </p> <p>The standard game mode, Showdown, is like call of duty and I love it as well. Exfil is just more long term, base building, gear building, etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hereforhelplol"> /u/hereforhelplol </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ili0ut/the_new_contractors_showdown_exfil_game_seems_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ili0ut/the_new_contractors_showdown_

## Sports in VR - 8k not good enough?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was browsing on YouTube for tennis match VR videos and saw one of the US open final a few years ago from court side. It was cool but nowhere near good enough quality to fully enjoy. It wasn’t in 8k, but from other videos I’ve seen even 8k videos won’t be good enough. It must be even worse for other sports (ie: football) where you need a zoomed out view. What’s the quality level that you think will make watching sport in VR viable and when do you think this will arrive?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georshaw"> /u/Georshaw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ilgho7/sports_in_vr_8k_not_good_enough/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ilgho7/sports_in_vr_8k_not_good_enough/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to love the Pimax Crystal Light so badly since on paper it is really the best headset in it&#39;s price range. The image quality is great and I actually really prefer the aspheric lenses to regular fresnel lenses although pan cake will always be superior imo. </p> <p>It&#39;s just the software and technical issues have been so off putting as well as the poor tracking. I know since I&#39;m on the 5080 and some High Res headsets are having issues with the 50 series gpus right now that I have to take things with a grain of salt but there are even issues I&#39;m having with it that non 50 series users are having and have had since release.</p> <p>I&#39;m still within my return window and I wanted some outside opinions on the Vive Pro 2 or if I should just hold out and keep the Crystal Light. Visually it&#39;s stunning and unlike anything I&#39;ve ever used but I starting to be ok with getting a slightly lower res and less vibrant headset if trac

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just going to &quot;test it out&quot; and ended up playing the first five levels and using most of my controller&#39;s batteries. I was afraid the controls would get in the way of such a fast paced, technical game but while it took a few minutes of adjusting once I found a good profile and realized how everything worked I quickly became nearly as proficient as I am with mouse and keyboard.</p> <p>So glad I never actually played past the first couple hours because the notion of experiencing this for the first time in VR is pretty appealing. Runs insanely well, too. I had every graphical option cranked and I didn&#39;t adjust anything. Seriously up there with Alyx and Lone Echo 2 for one of the best looking games I&#39;ve seen in the headset (PSVR OLED FTW!).</p> <p>Hope more folks give this one a shot.

## I did a big comparison of the 4090 vs 5090 in across 8 games at 100-400% with VD Ultra on the Quest 3. The 5090 scales way better for high res VR and can lead to some pretty serious gains vs what flatscreen's seen for people pushing high resolution!
