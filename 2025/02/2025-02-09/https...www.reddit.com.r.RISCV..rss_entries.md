## Is anyone developing a "Level 1 firmware" emulator/dynamic binary translation layer, similar to that used by Transmeta and Elbrus processors, to allow x86 operating systems like Windows to run on RISC-V semi-natively outside a virtual machine?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Because, as much as it may hurt to hear this, RISC-V isn&#39;t going to become a truly mainstream processor architecture for desktop and laptop PCs unless Windows can run on it. With the exception of a short window in the 1990s, Microsoft has been awfully hesitant to port Windows to other ISAs, it currently only being available for x86 and (with a much less-supported software ecosystem) ARM. Of course, Windows is closed-source, so it can&#39;t just be recompiled into RISC-V legally or easily by the community, and while reverse-engineering it is possible... progress on ReactOS has been glacial, and I don&#39;t imagine Microsoft customer support is very helpful to its users. Plus, like it or not, many people run Windows for its integration into the Microsoft ecosystem (i.e. its... <em>bloat</em>), not just its ability to run NT executables.</p> <p>A virtual machine (running it on top of an existing operating system, in this case also requiring an emula
