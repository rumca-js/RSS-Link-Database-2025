        "description": "Like a Dragon (or Yakuza, as it was formerly known) has to be one of the busiest and most active franchises around, which means we\u2019re never too far away from another new entry in the series. \n\nLike a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is now right around the corner, and even though it\u2019s a smaller and cheaper spinoff on paper, it\u2019s still turning more than a few heads. \n\nBuilding on Infinite Wealth\u2019s strong foundations, it will obviously feature plenty of familiar elements, but at the same time, it\u2019s also going to have its fair share of new ideas of its own, setting the experience apart from last year\u2019s game in numerous ways. As we count the days down to its launch, here, we\u2019re going to talk about just that.",

        "description": "More and more physical media has looked locked on to die a quick death. The last decade or so has seen digital sales\u2019 share increasing dramatically in virtually all markets and on pretty much every platform. \n\nBut of course, depending on the region and on even each individual player\u2019s preference, physical media is still far from fully dead, even if it has unequivocally become the more niche method of purchasing games at this point in time. \n\nWith all of that in mind, deciding whether or not to include a physical media option with its next PlayStation console is going to be far from a straightforward decision for Sony. Multiple factors are going to be at play, and here, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll be discussing.",
