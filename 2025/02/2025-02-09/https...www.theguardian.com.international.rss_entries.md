<p>Are they the same as crypto, why has the US president launched one, and who’s really coining it in? Here’s a complete guide to the latest digital money mania</p><p>Three days before his inauguration as US president, Donald Trump made an unusual move. He launched $Trump, a so-called meme coin that fans and speculators could buy in the hopes it would gain value. Initially, $Trump soared from a value of $7 to $75 per coin in a day, according to crypto price-tracking website CoinMarketCap. Two days later, it dropped to about $40 – just as incoming first lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, $Melania. Even the pastor at Trump’s inauguration ceremony, Lorenzo Sewell, got swept up in the meme coin frenzy, promoting a $Lorenzo version the same afternoon.</p><p><strong>So what exactly are meme coins, and why is everyone and their vicar suddenly getting involved?<br></strong>Meme coins are a type of digital asset based on a meme – usually something that has gone viral online.

<p>To be fair, arguments for both ‘helicopter’ and ‘free-range’ parenting are equally annoying</p><p>Often, parents tell me the world is more dangerous than it used to be. Others tell me we’re restricting our children too much and don’t let them run free. I guess I’m the worst of both worlds in that I think we should give our children more independence, but am too terrified to do so.</p><p>I sometimes accuse my wife of being a helicopter parent, because she sees threats around every corner. Her response, and it’s a hard one for me to argue against, is that I have the opposite affliction; an ‘It’ll be fine’ attitude borne from an inability to evaluate risk. The argument between ‘helicopter’ and ‘free-range’ parenting is not really one I find that interesting, not least because the proponents of both are equally annoying. It’s hard to think my children live in a more dangerous world than I did, if such a thing were even measurable, not least since everything from road deaths and abduct

All are cheering. Tahir has now finished her speech and is about to return to her chair, but the women in the hall won’t let her. “Sing for us!” they call. “Sing!”<
