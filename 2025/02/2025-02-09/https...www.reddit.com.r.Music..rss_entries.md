<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This track was made the weekend before the tariffs were announced, when I was really worried about my job. The company I work for exports most of the production to the USA, and those tariffs could have jeopardized my job and life. I never fully finished the piece the way I intended, and I purposely left it in this raw state, with all my frustration intact. I might finish the song if I can set aside a couple of days, adding a section about the minerals Trump wants from us—the real reason this is all happening.</p> <p>The music is based on “Higher Ground,”. and it is getting zero attention, isnt&#39; a remix if someone is wondering.......its more complicated that that, its both playing and AI and the entire mastering has been done in Ableton using Arturia FX and Izotope.<br/> Delete if not allowed please..... it is available on all streaming platforms just search Neurosonica Canada Is Not For Sale.<br/> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4HCHAU79F
