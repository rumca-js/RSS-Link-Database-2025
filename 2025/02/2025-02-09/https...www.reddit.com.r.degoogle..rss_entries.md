Furthermore, when I&#39;m using Google with my profile, when I have clear settings on the results, and everything else only being in a English, it still forces some German results. Like now it&#39;ll show wiki in English, and wiki in German. It&#39;s infuriating, I have reported the IP location issues to Google but nothing was done.
