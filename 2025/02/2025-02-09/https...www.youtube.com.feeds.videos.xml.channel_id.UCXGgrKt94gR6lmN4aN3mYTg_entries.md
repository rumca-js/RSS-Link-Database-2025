Join me as I dive deep into the sketchy world of Temu reviews and put their highest-rated products to the test. From fake SSDs to surprisingly decent retro consoles, I uncover the truth behind those suspiciously perfect ratings and even chat with a marketing professor about the dark side of online reviews.

Thank you to Professor Sandy Jap! https://sandyjap.com/
