I&#39;m looking for a book that I will read and will think about after, maybe even change my view on life. I love books that are written in a way where you can analyze every other line. It matters not the culture or the time period the book was written in. I don&#39;t mind whether the books are depressing, philosophical, or just appreciative of life. I love them all and i&#39;m open to any recommendations.
