I&#39;m coming up on the 5gb limit for free accounts and feel like rather than paying for the extras I&#39;d rather just get my own cloud. I don&#39;t really ever see this server requiring over 1 tb of storage so a full NAS with multiple bays feels unnecessary but also RAID redundancy seems important.</p> <p>Just curious how would you guys go about building a small server to replace dropbox/drive in a cost efficient way that satisifies security and backup/redundancy considerations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/recurnightmare"> /u/recurnightmare </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ils3go/what_would_be_the_best_way_to_run_a_small_home/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ils3go/what_would_be_the_best_way_to_run_a_small_home/">[comments]</a></span>
