As far as fantasy elements go, they&#39;re mostly window dressing to a story about a small business finding success, you could strip them out or make them mundane, and it would be the same story.

In web fiction, the priority shifts from telling a well-paced story to maximizing engagement, often at the expense of narrative progression. As the series develops, it frequently slows down with interludes that feel more like padding than meaningful additions. Whether these detours exist to stretch the story or because the author needs to backtrack and fix plot issues is debatable\u2014but either way, they disrupt the flow.</p> <h1>Portrayal of Sexuality</h1> <p>As an older straight man from the UK, with friends who identify differently from me, I find the way sexuality is handled in this series a bit off. The way characters react to these themes doesn\u2019t always feel natural, and I suspect this might be influenced by cultural differences.

Bit of a different request but this year I\u2019m on a mission to educate myself in mythology, lore and things I have otherwise missed. Backstory: I was raised in a cult. I never learned about dinosaurs or any history predating Jesus, my history and science lessons were \u201cbiblical\u201d (I only found out that women and men have the same amount of ribs a few years ago). I never encountered Greek mythology or really anything that communicated the spirituality of other cultural groups. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been reading a lot and have enjoyed the journey of learning through reading. I\u2019ve been focusing a lot on classics and philosophy but I really enjoy fantasy and think there is validity to incorporating books I would have been banned from reading. </p> <p>So. What fantasy titles do you consider to be foundational? Classics? What fantasy titles do you think do a good job of portraying different cultures and belief systems/modes of spirituality.
