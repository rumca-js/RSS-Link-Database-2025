The more I dig into the WordPress core, the less I like it, but we all know that already: heavy backward compatibility comes at a price.</p> <p>In this post, I will talk about an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability that I reported more than 3 months ago, and unfortunately, it has been dismissed as <em>&quot;a fix for this has been in the works for a few years, due to complexity and low severity.&quot;</em></p> <p>Fair, and far from me to write one more rant (we have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/">enough WP drama</a> at the moment), but I believe that in an open source project, vulnerabilities also belong to the community and after a reasonable amount of time they have to be disclosed, even if unpatched.</p> <h3>Not just another SSRF</h3> <p>There are a couple of known SSRF vulnerabilities in the WordPress
