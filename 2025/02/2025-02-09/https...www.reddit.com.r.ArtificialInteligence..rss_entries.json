The person can click next to have the model generate another image with a random seed.</li> <li>The model starts out with no pre-training and is trained purely to maximize the time the person looks at the image before they click next.</li> </ul> <p>I didn\u2019t think this would be practical to actually do since a large number of the initial iterations would be noise, but I always wondered what kinds of hypnotic images it would generate and how far it could go in creating sophisticated visuals with just this signal and enough feedback.
