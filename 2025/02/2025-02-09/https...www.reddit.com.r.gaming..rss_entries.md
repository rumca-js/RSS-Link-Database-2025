<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got it for about $5 on Switch. Wanted a light arcade racer where I could turn my brain off and wind down after work and I figured a kids toy game would do it. Honestly I was drunk when I bought it and I thought that was why I couldn&#39;t even place in races. Once I sobered up I tried it again and I didn&#39;t do ANY better. I didn&#39;t understand, it&#39;s a drift racer, I grew up on Mario Kart, I should be good at this, I&#39;m not letting this game beat me. I refused to lower the difficulty and kept trying it until I was clenched up with adrenaline and managed one perfect 1st place race. In that moment I remembered playing Twisted Metal at a friend&#39;s house and getting instantly wrecked only to watch him effortlessly fly through the stages. I&#39;ve been playing it for about 20 hours now and I&#39;m still fighting for every race and I love it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cadnofor"> /
