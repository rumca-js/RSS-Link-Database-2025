I don\u2019t know much about the different fields but the idea of searching for vulnerabilities sounds interesting, so learning how to do that on the fastest road to being employable would be cool.</p> <p>I know it\u2019s something that everyone does at their own rate but the options are over whelming, I just need something slightly on the rails to get back into the flow of it.
