I compared with newer versions and with Synology, but stayed on my appetite. </p> <p>I want features such as image metadata reading and group them by people, location, date etc. Like Apple Photos.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The boring backstory: </p> <p>OK So, I have an older gaming rig that I was using for some AI work. I wanted to turn it into a more flexible home server and move some of my docker images off the old laptop I am using now. I started down the path of putting Proxmox on it for greater flexibility, but then I am thinking do I really need that level of complexity. So… I figured I’d ask the group for options. </p> <p>The goal: </p> <p>Home server primarily to host dockerized web apps such as OpenWebUI, Rustdesk, Comfyui, FreshRSS, N8B, and anything else I want to play with. </p> <p>The burning question: </p> <p>Is Proxmox worth it? Or should I just go with a Linux distro? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rc_ym"> /u/rc_ym </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ipsia1/proxmox_or_bare_linux_for_dockerai_second_box/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First off, I am new to self hosting and Linux so I&#39;m not entirely sure what I&#39;m doing. I got interested in self hosting and decided to buy some minipcs, so I have 2 beefier CPU minipcs and one N100 minipc. On the beefy ones I&#39;m running windows 11 for a Jellyfin server because I like to browse the internet to get my media and be able to rename files and remux and stuff using mkvtoolnix. I&#39;ve tried the -arr suite before and just didn&#39;t find it to my taste. I&#39;m also running my reverse proxy on the same PC as Jellyfin which I use for that and my game server which is on the other beefy PC. This again, also runs windows because I need things like curse forge for some games and it overall makes it easier for me to switch game servers if I want. The N100 minipc I&#39;m running Debian Linux(with gui) and am going to try out docker or some sort of container thing to run a Vaultwarden, wire guard, and either pihole or adguard (haven&#39;

I&#39;ve gotten as far as installing Docker Desktop and getting the container running to access the webgui. But I can&#39;t figure out where to go from here. The datarhei videos I have looked at have not been helpful in the slightest and they seem like they are made for people who already mostly know what they are doing. </p> <p>I&#39;ve checked SRT server and it&#39;s set to use port 6000. I didn&#39;t fill in the other fields (token and passphrase) because I don&#39;t know their purpose. When I try to add a new video source from the main webgui, it has an additional field called &quot;Input Stream&quot; that isn&#39;t present in the only SRT connection video they have. My SRT URL also includes a streamid that is not present in the URL in their video. When I try putting that URL into IRL Pro on my pho
