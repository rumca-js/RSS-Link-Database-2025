While it\u2019s not entirely untrue \u2014some people do dislike religion due to personal trauma\u2014I think it reduces queer criticism of religion to an impulsive, irrational and personal reaction. This, inadvertently for the most part, erases the very real and systemic harm that Abrahamic religions have inflicted on our ommunity. </p> <p>There\u2019s a dozens of holy texts morally preaching against our existence, a hundred countries where religion is harmful to our rights, a thousand year long history of religious persecution of queer people, hundreds of thousands churches and mosques advocating against us, millions of believers flocking to the polls to erase our existence . </p> <p>We have as many reasons to dislike religion",
