It&#39;s still early days in my career, but I really don&#39;t see myself being satisfied in an accounting career, which is why I am considering a move to a tech-related area in the future, with cybersecurity always being an interest of mine.</p> <p>I noticed that there are some accountants who make the transition to a cybersecurity role in an area called &quot;cyber and technology risk and governance&quot;. What exactly is this area, is it less techcnical than other cybersecurity roles, and is it a good space for an accountant to get into?

I\u2019m sure this will be pretty trivial for many in this sub but I\u2019m also well aware of a large amount of novices trying to learn and get into the field or early in their career trying to learn. </p> <p>I recently began writing blog posts every once in a while when I get some motivation and decided to share some knowledge on hunting for injection attempts through uri query parameters. It\u2019s most certainly not an end-all-be-all however I think it\u2019s a good stepping stone to build off of and make more specific for certain applications.</p> <p>Please, feel free to provide feedback, ask questions, whatever. Trying to build some kind of community and would love to tackle some more advanced topics if I garner interest from the community.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/talkincyber\"> /u/talkincyber </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.talkincyber.com/hu",
