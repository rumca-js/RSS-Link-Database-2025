<p class="has-text-align-none">While the cat protagonist from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/512500/oscars-2025-nominations-full-list-academy-awards">Oscar-nominated animated movie <em>Flow</em></a><em> </em>is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/522108/flow-cat-latvia-popular">getting a <em>lot</em> of (deserved) love</a> — and will get more now that <em>Flow</em> is streaming on Max — the movie actually has a whole cast of animals, which hunker together on a tiny boat adrift in the middle of rapidly rising waters. In addition to the cat, there’s a grumpy capybara, an inquisitive lemur, an overly friendly dog, and a regal secretary bird. None of these animals were present in the movie’s original iterat

The list of included games is long, but several of them stuck out to me as they’re personal favorites I wouldn’t want anybody to miss. </p>

The end result is kind of a mess. That mess was compounded during a “5D” screening of the movie I saw on Thursday night, which turned the traditional theatergoing experience into an event where I was caked with mud and nasally assaulted with perfume that would make Tom Haverford weep. It also may have permanently ruined a Uniqlo hoodie I kin

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Before Anna Huerta worked at Maxis, owned by Electronic Arts, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/449622/the-sims-4-project-rene-labs-10-year-anniversary">on <em>The Sims 4</em></a>, she still played the game professionally. The success of The Sims as a franchise made it one of those games that other companies were always chasing, and to begin to understand it, you’ve got to play it not just as a fan, but as a professional.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winter may be slowly coming to an end, but the cold and dark months haven’t quite closed out just yet. To help you pass the time indoors, Netflix has got a nice little selection of horror movies at the moment, to keep things creepy and cozy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month, we handpicked a few of the best horror movies on Netflix that fit the current season. We’ve got a recent zombie movie classic, a terrifying movie about the dangers of hiking in a haunted Scandinavian forest, and a complex and under-seen gem about the horrors of the British immigration system. </p>
