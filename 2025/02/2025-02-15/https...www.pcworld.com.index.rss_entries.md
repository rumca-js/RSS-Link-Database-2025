<p>Sure, you might be able to crack open that laptop and swap out the main drive for a bigger one, or even install a second drive alongside it for additional storage. And yes, you can <em>definitely</em> do that with a desktop PC.</p>



<p>But if you have zero affinity for computer tinkering, then it’s just way more convenient to buy the right amount of storage from the get-go. Working on a computer with a too-small-for-your-needs SSD can be miserable, but you also don’t want

<p>If you’re looking to speed up your PC, you should consider using two <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html">SSDs</a> instead of one. One way to do this is to configure the two drives in a RAID 0 array. This allows the read and write speeds of both SSDs to be combined, resulting in impressive benchmark results. Another way is using one SSD for the operating system and the other for applications and games. In this guide, we’ll explain how to effectively use two SSDs to free up bandwidth.</p>
