								<p>At the risk of sounding repetitive, <strong>Pokémon 151</strong> is one of the hardest modern sets to find. Loads of Pokémon TCG products are repeatedly dropping out of stock right now, but 151 has been flying off shelves ever since it released in 2023, and after a year and a half of that, it’s likely that 151 will finally go out of print soon. So, <strong>Blooming Waters</strong> is probably your last chance to get Pokémon 151.</p>

								<p>It’s fundamentally impossible to create a videogame that truly recreates the full experience of playing <strong>DnD</strong>. Larian’s extraordinary Baldur’s Gate 3 comes closer than ever before; it can’t replicate DnD’s mutative, imaginative quality, but it mimics it shockingly well by interweaving tons of well written adventures for players to explore however they like. BG3 is so good, in fact, that it left me doubting if a CRPG could possibly capture D&amp;D any better. Then I played <strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</strong>, and I realized - as Boromir once said - that there are "other paths we might take".</p>

								<p>How do you create a new roleplaying game set in Warhammer’s Old World, when Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying has done such an excellent job with the setting already? That was the challenge facing the team at Cubicle 7 when they began work on the new <strong>Warhammer: The Old World Roleplaying Game</strong>, a title set in the same world of grim and perilous adventure as WFRP, but 250 years earlier.</p>
