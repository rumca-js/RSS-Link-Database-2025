My next issue with tails is how it decided to not operate from a single partition on a USB, rather they made it such a way that you have to write it to the whole USB disk to make it work. Instead of having a standard ISO file with CDROM type, tails is an img file with EFI partion. With puppy you can do a dd of the iso file to the partition of your liking(but still that alone doesn&#39;t work because your",
