From what I understand now, I need to increase the partition and then the volume group?</p> <p>When I run a fdisk -l, I get:</p> <pre><code>Disk /dev/sda: 96 GiB, 103079215104 bytes, 201326592 sectors Disk model: QEMU HARDDISK Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disklabel type: gpt Disk identifier: A0FDF1CE-288B-46B2-AD38-8F557EF4BC44 Device Start End Sectors Size Type /dev/sda1 2048 4095 2048 1M BIOS boot /dev/sda2 4096 4198399 4194304 2",

I like the simple and integrated QNAP offering. The management and features are dated. I compared with newer versions and with Synology, but stayed on my appetite. </p> <p>I want features such as image metadata reading and group them by people, location, date etc. Like Apple Photos. Immich seems like a good choice. Own Cloud could be a good solution for documents and collaboration. File sharing in general as well as Time Machine backups I\u2019m happy with the UNAS PRO. </p> <p>So I thought, how good can a self hosted cloud be if it\u2019s based on a separate server appliance that mounts the network store (vs an all in one like QNAp/Synology/Truenas) ?</p> <p>Thanks for any suggestions and/or recommendations </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
