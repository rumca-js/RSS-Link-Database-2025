<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to get the source code of this app, but it contains some. compressed files, and I&#39;m not very experienced with reverse engineering. Is there a way to properly extract everything? Also, if anyone already has a fully unpacked version, could you share it as a ZIP so I can check the source? I&#39;m also wondering if the app has any API keys or secrets stored somewhere. Any help would be appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee8"> /u/zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="http://update.mornar.online">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ipvbg4/help_about_app_i_want_to_remake/">[comments]</a></span>
