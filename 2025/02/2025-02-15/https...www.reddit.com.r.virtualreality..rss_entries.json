Do VD override the settings in SteamVr, or do the SteamVR settings matter for games which use OpenVR and start via SteamVR?</p> <p>Background:</p> <p>I&#39;ve been reading here a lot since I got my Quest 3 a couple of weeks ago but still trying to understand all this stuff..long way to go.</p> <p>I&#39;ve got so far that many games are OpenVR based and need still to launch into/from SteamVR - even if one&#39;s using Virtual Desktop.</p> <p>My example: Paper Beast I bought VD, and the game on steam. Set all the settings in VD, started the game from the games tab in VD... SteamVR with it&#39;s own settings launches, then the game launches.</p> <p>Which settings matter in the end in sich cases?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/don4ndrej\"> /u/don4ndrej </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iqed7d/do_virtual_desktop_settings_override_thos",

Firstly the refresh rate always stays at 72hz no matter what I do. Secondly when I change the encode bitrate in the debug at all oculus link just does not work Finally in steamVR specifically the image is super grainy and there are these weird lines on my screen that almost look like scanlines but they don&#39;t move. And in FNAF VR2 the performance is very mediocre. Overall I am just very confused about this and would like to ask for any help about this issue, if anyone could help me I would be immensely grateful.
