It has some interesting parts ( Hel&#39;s childhood on Xangai and him rebuilding his life after the war) but I still don&#39;t feel involved with the story or the characters. And it has a lot of unnecessary stuff, at least for me. The chapter with Hel and Le Cagot in the cave can help you understand his mind now, but feels like extra.

I need 8/9, but do I rebuy 10 to have a correct complete set? Unfortunately this book is old and I don\u2019t remember where I got it, as well as being slightly damaged. Not that they would ever resell it or cut the pages and rebind it anyway, not worth it. But would you rebuy? Or just put a sticky note or artificial sleeve on it?

There are 5 species which are in the process of joining up with the humans, and once the Bobs learned of the galaxy collision they decided the proper course of action is to take all known species to a new galaxy; just like the PGF.",

I am instantly transported to the point where I am one and the same with the main character, for better or for worse. I wish I had the language to describe just how compelling his work is. I will never stop being Zweig&#39;s personal marketer. I&#39;m only 50~ pages into Beware of Pity but I cannot get over how beautiful it is. Even the short introduction written by Zweig left me in awe. </p> <p>I just wanted to gush about Zweig here. No one else ever knows who I&#39;m talking about!
