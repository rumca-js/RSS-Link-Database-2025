It&#39;s still early days in my career, but I really don&#39;t see myself being satisfied in an accounting career, which is why I am considering a move to a tech-related area in the future, with cybersecurity always being an interest of mine.</p> <p>I noticed that there are some accountants who make the transition to a cybersecurity role in an area called &quot;cyber and technology risk and governance&quot;. What exactly is this area, is it less techcnical than other cybersecurity roles, and is it a good space for an accountant to get into? Thanks a lot!</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Bz0YtUO">https://imgur.com/a/Bz0YtUO</a> - LinkedIn example of person in this area</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Big_Couple_3712"> /u/Big_Couple_3712 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1iqd

It has a more technical focus on cybersecurity engineering and is closer to London, which could help with jobs in finance and tech. Manchester’s program is broader, has ties to GCHQ, and is in a growing tech hub with lower living costs.</p> <p>For anyone familiar with these programs or working in cybersecurity, which university has better industry connections and job opportunities? Any insights would be really helpful. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brxenpetals"> /u/brxenpetals </a> <br/> <span><a

The article does a great job of mapping out the key players involved, outlining the different factors that contribute to cyber risks, and exploring the various ways cyber activity could impact Greenland. </p> <p>One thing that came to mind while reading was how high-profile geopolitical narratives can be exploited in cyber operations. Take Trump’s repeated remarks about buying Greenland. While not directly related to cybersecurity, this kind of widely discussed topic could easily be used as a lure in spear-phishing campaigns. This isn’t something the article explicitly discusses, but it’s a good example of how cyber threats often exploit geopolitical discourse.</p> <p>One part where I didn&#39;t fully understand the re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good evening/afternoon/morning to all of you warriors. I’m sure this will be pretty trivial for many in this sub but I’m also well aware of a large amount of novices trying to learn and get into the field or early in their career trying to learn. </p> <p>I recently began writing blog posts every once in a while when I get some motivation and decided to share some knowledge on hunting for injection attempts through uri query parameters. It’s most certainly not an end-all-be-all however I think it’s a good stepping stone to build off of and make more specific for certain applications.</p> <p>Please, feel free to provide feedback, ask questions, whatever. Trying to build some kind of community and would love to tackle some more advanced topics if I garner interest from the community.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/talkincyber"> /u/talkincyber </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.talkincyber.com/hu
