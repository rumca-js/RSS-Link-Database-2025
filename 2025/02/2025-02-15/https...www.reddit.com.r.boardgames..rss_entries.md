On the CTG website it says that it&#39;s live on Gamefound. But when you go to Gamefound, it says the pledge manager is closed. I&#39;m guessing that just means I missed the mark on pre-orders, right? And I need to just wait for the retail version to come out?

In the manual it says revolt happens when you have no tribes in a region or no political card associated with that region. Spies aren&#39;t armies, so I don&#39;t see how they would protect you from a revolt.

Clue is one of those games that can be easily house ruled.</p> <p>I have thought of giving the solution envelope to a third party who is not in the game (the comic store owner) and just asking them if the place, weapon, and suspect are correct as a way to avoid player elimination.

Thanks everyone for the comments!</p> <p>I got invited to a session, and even managed to win one game, but most of the time I don&#39;t know what to say or do and mostly just keep quiet or say something vaguely defensive when accused. When I play other games there is usually a &quot;path&quot; of sort that I kinda the get the gist of to follow, but I can&#39;t find one with this game. I couldn&#39;t find a lead when all info I got are who died each night, but some players seem to really figure things out early and accused others left and right easily. Is there a playbook of sort on what to do in this game and some sample paths to take? I&#39;m on the fence whether to attend anoth

The base game rules are easy enough to understand, we’re having some trouble parsing a rule from the alternate play.</p> <p>In the alternate rules, they remove jumping but add the concept of collision/clash without defining how a clash works beyond how it resolves. So my question, do the dice collide by moving your die adjacent to the opponent’s or does the clash replace the jump completely? Like if you would/could jump you clash instead

I&#39;m hoping someone in the Reddit community might be familiar with it.</p> <p>If you have any information about &quot;Pangaea&quot;
