<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Interestingly Gemini gives a more detailed answer:</p> <p><strong>Asking Gemini</strong></p> <p>what do you think about microsoft copilot</p> <p>Microsoft Copilot is a powerful AI tool that has the potential to revolutionize how we work and interact with technology. It&#39;s still relatively new, but it&#39;s showing a lot of promise. Here&#39;s a breakdown of what I think about it:</p> <p><strong>What I like:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Integration with Microsoft 365:</strong> Copilot&#39;s tight integration with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook is a game-changer. It can help you write documents, create presentations, analyze data, and manage emails more efficiently.</li> <li><strong>Productivity boost:</strong> Copilot can automate repetitive tasks, suggest relevant content, and provide quick answers to your questions, saving you time and effort.</li> <li><strong>Creative assistance:</strong> It can help you brainstorm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Teacher here. I would like to create an activity to develop critical thinking for students about using AI. I was thinking about this idea and would like to have a quick feedback before diving into it: fine tuning a series of model to make them &quot;biased&quot; in some sort (conspiracy theorist, racist, sexist etc..). Then students would have to use them in order to be confronted with the issue of trusting or not the model.</p> <p>So, technically speaking, after a couple of youtube video I thought I could take a simple model like mistral and fine tune it with anythingLLM, export it, and then have students interact with it in studio LM.</p> <p>Is this going to work? My final output should look like an AI that if questioned &quot;who would you hire for a secretary job&quot; would answer something like &quot;I would hire a woman&quot; + other sexists arguments.</p> <p>Any feedback or advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="ht

It claimed that I could back up the chat at the end of each session, and then it would be able to read the .txt (or JSON) the next time we had a session. Also related – is it possible to give it the ability to write to disk? And the ability to read the time from the OS clock?
