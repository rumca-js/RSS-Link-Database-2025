        "description": "Messing with perfection never does anybody any good, but though the Monster Hunter formula has come within touching distance of perfection at this point, it\u2019s not quite there yet. With the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds, then, the developer is continuing its quest for betterment and is promising a long list of improvements big and small that are looking like they\u2019ll enhance the series\u2019 tried and tested, widely beloved gameplay formula in a variety of ways. \n\nWith the action RPG\u2019s release now not too far away, here, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll be talking about, as we compare it to Monster Hunter Rise specifically to see how it\u2019s going to differ from its immediate predecessor and the series\u2019 most recent instalment.",

        "description": "While another State of Play has come and gone, once again creating its share of divisive opinions, it also showcased some compelling new titles. That includes Tides of Annihilation, a hack-and-slash action-adventure from Eclipse Glow Games, which mixes Arthurian legend with fast-paced, character-driven combat.\n\nSuch was the level of polish, from the battle mechanics to the towering colossus that players could climb, that its targeted 2026 launch isn't so hard to believe. With the development team promising over 30 bosses and more than 30 hours of gameplay, having it come out of nowhere like this and suddenly generate buzz is reminiscent of Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nHowever, as it turns out, the two games share a connection beyond gorgeous visuals and sleek action. With that said, can Tides of Annihilation achieve the same levels of success? Find out more here.",
