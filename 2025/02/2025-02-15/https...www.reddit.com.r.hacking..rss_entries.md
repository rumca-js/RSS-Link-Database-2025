<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m 32 and finishing my AA this semester and getting ready to transfer, I’m curious if there are any BA/BS programs you guys could recommend or any certificate programs, my AA is just in social science (bounced around a lot when I was younger, had to finish my AA to be eligible financial aid in the future, that was the degree I was closest to)</p> <p>I’m open to other alternatives, years ago I messed around with overthewire.org but life happened and I fell off without feeling like I ever learned any transferable skills. I don’t know much about the different fields but the idea of searching for vulnerabilities sounds interesting, so learning how to do that on the fastest road to being employable would be cool.</p> <p>I know it’s something that everyone does at their own rate but the options are over whelming, I just need something slightly on the rails to get back into the flow of it. All suggestions are greatly appreciated thank you so much in advanc
