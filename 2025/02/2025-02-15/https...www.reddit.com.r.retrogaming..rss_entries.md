<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is one of those bits of video game &quot;history&quot; that everyone gets wrong and it&#39;s clear nobody has actually read the thing people point to. So the common myth: Gumpei Yokoi invented the d-pad with the game &amp; watch series game Donkey Kong and Nintendo got a patent on the idea, so nobody could use the cross-shaped d-pad until the patent expired. A nice internet myth, except it&#39;s completely false.</p> <p>Firstly, before we get into the history of the d-pad itself, let&#39;s talk about Nintendo&#39;s patent: It doesn&#39;t list Gumpei Yokoi *at all.* He is not listed as the person who filed the patent, nor the &quot;inventor&quot; in the patent.

## Morph 4k S-Video N64

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Really hope someone can help me out with this. Strongly considering the Morph 4k over the Retrotink 5x Pro. The only issue is I dont want to mod my console and this analog bridge to connect S video keeps getting pushed back. Right now I run my console thru the Retroscaler 2x (Tink 2x chinese clone) via Insurection Industries S video cables. My question is can I keep the setup and basically just run the HDMI out to the Morph 4k since its got both HDMI In/Out and then into my tv. What else would I need to accomplish this? Also I think I would probaly have to run the scaler in bypass mode. Really all the confusion is why I&#39;m thinking about just getting the 5x. Really any guidance on this is greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal_Fee5936"> /u/Zealousideal_Fee5936 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1iprrrq/morph_4k_svideo_n64/">[link
