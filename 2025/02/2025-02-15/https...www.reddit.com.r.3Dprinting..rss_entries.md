THAT was a learning experience. It&#39;s also probably a massive contributor to the amount of purged filament. Before anybody asks, I calibrated my printer to produce 50% less poop and added a much smaller purge tower. I&#39;ll probably look at reducing it even further though.</p> <p>Definitely some imperfections on the print, but that&#39;s mostly my fault, not the model. </p> <p>Overall I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out.
