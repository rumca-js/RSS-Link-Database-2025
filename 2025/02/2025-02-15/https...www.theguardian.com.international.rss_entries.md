<p>At 32 the striker is part of a new generation, powered by science and making a huge impact on the title race</p><p>It takes a team to win trophies but it is quite useful to have an individual enjoy the season of their life. Mohamed Salah is that for Liverpool. Highlighting his importance to his side’s success is not exactly controversial but any praise is merited after driving his team into pole position as the business end approaches.</p><p>Salah leads the Premier League scoring and creativity charts with 22 goals and 14 assists to put Liverpool clear at the top. On a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/12/everton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">difficult night at Goodison Park </a>in midweek, he set up the opener before scoring in a game of few chances, the ninth time this season he has achieved such a feat.

No sooner had I booked trains and hotels, though, than it emerged Sunderland had accumulated enough Northern Ireland internationals for their League One game against Oxford to be called off.

<p>The Parasite director delivers an intriguing yet baffling sci-fi epic, featuring panto gnashing bad guys played by Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette</p><p>The Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho has delivered his first movie since the Oscar-winning Parasite six years ago, and it’s a great, big, slightly soft-edged sci-fi-fantasy. Adapted by Bong from Edward Ashton’s novel, it stars Robert Pattinson as a bio-clone menial worker of the future, condemned to eternal life, or eternal death, being repeatedly killed in the service of a space-exploration corporation, doing fatally dangerous jobs and then reincarnated.<br><br>
 It’s a broad-brush futurist satire on the theme of Elon Musk-type tech bros who say that whining about the environment is for libtards because we’re all shooting off for space really soon, where there have to be viable planets somewhere, and any current alien inhabitants are expendable — as indeed are the working humans who are getting us out to new worlds.</p><p>Mickey 17 is s

<p>Wait long enough in football and you will eventually see almost everything. Calvin Bassey is a defenders’ defender. He stops opponents scoring. He is quick and good in the air. He is very good at looking authoritative when holding his arms out to craft the offside line. He is not a habitual goalscorer. But, a year less a week since his only other strike for Fulham, the 25-year-old headed his first goal at Craven Cottage and so Nottingham Forest joined the short list of Falkirk, Volendam and Manchester United as teams he has scored against.</p><p>At least until the 1987 League Cup final, when Charlie Nicholas ruined the factoid, commentators loved to point out that when Ian Rush scored, Liverpool never lost. Bassey is even better than that: whenever he has scored, whether it’s in the Eredivisie or the Scottish League Cup, his side has won. Which, on Saturday, felt only right. They were much the better side for long periods and that Forest had somehow gone in level at half-time felt

<p>Mikel Arteta asked his Arsenal squad to show they could continue to fight for the title despite stomaching a significant injury to Kai Havertz. For 80 minutes it seemed fears of being blunt in attack would be founded in a frustrating stalemate at struggling Leicester but then Ethan Nwaneri dinked a feathery cross into the box and the substitute Mikel Merino, unmarked between Wout Faes and Woyo Coulibaly six yards out, twisted his head to power in the first of two late goals. Merino, who replaced the ineffective Raheem Sterling, sealed victory with three minutes of normal time to play, to maintain Arsenal’s challenge.</p><p>Arteta began with Leandro Trossard as a false nine, Sterling to his left and Nwaneri to his right in a three-pronged attack but until Merino’s header the Arsenal manager must have been wondering how else to penetrate Leicester, now without a clean sheet in 21 matches in all competitions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/15/leicester-ars

<p>More Black people are leaving religion, challenging tradition and redefining community</p><p>In 2015, Mandisa Thomas faced a harrowing confrontation while tabling for Black Nonbelievers Inc, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and increasing visibility for Black atheists. The event, hosted by the Atheist Alliance of America, coincided with the Women of Color and Ministries Conference in the same hotel.</p><p>“There was one Black woman in particular who came up to our table,” Thomas recalls. “She became very belligerent, even though I was polite to her. She told me that she could not believe I had the nerve to identify as an atheist in front of white devils. She said I had a slave mentality and that she was going to bathe me in the blood of Jesus. She [said she] felt sorry for my mama and my kids. It was just absolutely mind-boggling.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/black-non-religious-atheists">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At 83, The Accidental Tourist author discusses the secret to a good marriage, publishing her 25th book and why she can no longer keep politics out of her novels</p><p>“I’m ashamed,” Anne Tyler says of the publication of her new novel, Three Days in June, a typically Tyleresque off‑kilter romantic comedy about a long-divorced, mismatched couple. “I&nbsp;didn’t even realise I was up to 25. If you look at a writer’s work and you see that many titles you think, ‘Well, it can’t be very serious work.’ But that’s what happened.”</p><p>The seriousness of Tyler’s fiction, which includes much-loved novels Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist and the Pulitzer prize-winning Breathing Lessons, has bothered critics for decades. How could a writer of such witty, warm, kind novels about middle-class families that contain very little historical context, no politics or sex, even, really be one of America’s finest living novelists, as so many have claimed? Not to mention her pro

<p>Tell people they’ll be upset by The Years and they may be. But they may also enjoy it</p><p>If your Valentine disappointed you this weekend, spare a thought for the protagonist of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/aug/02/the-years-review-almeida-theatre-london-annie-ernaux-five-stars">The Years</a>, </em>the explosive West End play based on the writings of the French novelist and Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux. A teenager is thrilled to discover she has attracted the temporary attention of an older man at summer camp. After he painfully takes her virginity, she gradually realises that he has told half the resort. She finds the word “whore” scribbled across her bathroom mirror. Still she yearns for the validation of his returning desire.</p><p>The play takes as its subject the full range of life experiences contingent on embodied womanhood. Like the Ernaux memoir from which it draws its name, its heroine tells her story in the plural “we” and speaks for a gen

## Exploring Siena, Tuscany’s other artistic masterpiece

<p>A major new exhibition at the National Gallery puts the spotlight on the Tuscan town’s artistic heritage. But nothing beats exploring its historic neighbourhoods on foot</p><p>This warren of narrow streets, some so tight that only the noon sunshine penetrates all the way down to the cobbles, is part gothic, part romanesque, and all beautiful. It’s&nbsp;blessed with an embarrassment of architectural riches and wrapped up in&nbsp;wonderfully preserved medieval walls that hug the city tightly, an enchantingly compact tangle of sandstone and terracotta perched on a&nbsp;hill overlooking a quintessentially Tuscan landscape of olive groves and vineyards and winding gravel roads. In any other corner of the world, Siena would be the only show in town.</p><p>Around here though, there are several noisy neighbours. And none makes more of a racket than Florence, 50 miles north, famously the birthplace of the Renaissance and home of the Medici, Michelangelo, Giotto and Leonardo da Vinci. These
