It really is amazing, even in my thirties I make it a point to go once a year. I remember seeing Jurassic Park there when k was like 7 and it felt so cool to be outdoors watching such an outdoor movie. What have you seen at the drive-in and was it elevated just by virtue of being a drive-in movie? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CWKitch\"> /u/CWKitch </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ipzo2r/have_you_been_to_a_drivein_movie/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ipzo2r/have_you_been_to_a_drivein_movie/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The book was readable and entertaining but imo didn\u2019t hold a candle to the film. Rosamund pike\u2019s performance turned Amy into an anti hero (or not based on your definition) and completely devoured every scene she was in. The book spent so much time with Nick who was essentially a stock character and Ben Affleck played it perfectly while giving plenty of room for the actual substance of the story. I think film was a better medium for the nuance of emotions and picked up the slack where the book lagged.</p> <p>So my question for Reddit is what film did you think was better than the book and why? Was it a particular performance?

It&#39;s a very safe and corporate version of T2, that is until the very last 5 minutes. Judgement day happens as it&#39;s revealed that skynet has become an omnipresent piece of software incapable of being simply turned off. The characters pretty much lose everything except their lives, though there is the promise of eventual victory based on this alone. It&#39;s such a tragic yet hopeful ending, shot well, scored well, even the monologue from the film&#39;s lackluster John Connor is pretty decent. It&#39;s sad that the franchise really never got better than these 5 minutes in over 20 years and 3 movies (I like salvation but man is it kind of a fucking dumb movie lol).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/N0r3m0rse\"> /u/N0r3m0rse </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ipyams/",
