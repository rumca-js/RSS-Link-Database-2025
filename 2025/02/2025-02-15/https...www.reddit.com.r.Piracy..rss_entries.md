<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like the title says; alot of you guys keep suggesting debrid or streamio (or similar if I got the spelling wrong). From my understanding; they sound like successort to PopcornTime.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what I understand; Popcorn🍿 Time is actually a specialised Bittorrent which caches the BT file sequentially and then starts playback as soon as there&#39;s enough to start. End of the day (or movie); you have a proper download of the movie in your cache after you&#39;re done watching *(which gets cleared after you reach a limit; or you backup the file for later rewatch). And speed of downloads is dependent on how many seeders/leechers there are?</p> <p>I&#39;m assuming real debrid/streamio works that way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ashamed-Ad4508"> /u/Ashamed-Ad4508 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ipymy6/discussion_is_real_debridstreamio_the_grandchild/">[link]
