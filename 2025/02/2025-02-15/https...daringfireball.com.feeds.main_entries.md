<p>Sad news, posted to his Mastodon account:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Martin passed away yesterday, peacefully in his sleep. He was a
true fighter until the bitter end but he is now pain free and
at peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’d been <a href="https://mcubedsw.com/blog/an_update_on_coppice_and_myself">remarkably open</a> about his battle against cancer, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pilky/113621747966083180">including</a> the fact that he knew the end was near.</p>

<p>I linked to his <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/09/18/m3installcontroller">software</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/08/19/dtgeeks">writing</a> several times over years. He was a Mac developer’s Mac developer, with an eye for details, and his own work was infused with fine craftsmanship.

  <p>Netflix deeply regrets accidentally making Netflix a better
product for its customers. It temporarily pushed out a change that
let people <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/have-apple-and-netflix-finally-made-an-apple-tv-deal/">see Netflix shows in the Apple TV app</a>, a change
people have been asking for since the debut of the Apple TV app in
2016 with its Up Next queue and content aggregation features.
Fortunately, Netflix swiftly corrected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">the error</a> before
