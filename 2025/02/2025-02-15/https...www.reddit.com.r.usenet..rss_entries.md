<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Certain groups I pull from typically have many hundreds of posts a day and recently the volume has fallen off to nearly zero... or so it appears on nzbgeek.</p> <p>Is anybody aware of problems with nzbgeek or a significant fall off in usenet volume in the last week or two?</p> <p>Edit: in the old days of usenet there used to be sites that tracked daily volume on various groups. I can&#39;t find any sites like this anymore. Do they exist?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TentativeTacoChef"> /u/TentativeTacoChef </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iqd3dk/sharp_drop_off_in_postings_or_indexer_problem/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iqd3dk/sharp_drop_off_in_postings_or_indexer_problem/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I signed up for Frugal Usenet at the start of the year and have been having a pretty good experience with them, up until about a week ago. I&#39;m on gigabit fiber and was seeing download speeds of 80-90 MB/s, but over the last week it seems like my speeds are capped at around 11.1MB/s. </p> <p>I&#39;ve changed nothing on my end and was wondering if anyone else has been having similar issues recently.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dangerskew"> /u/dangerskew </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iqa8sd/anyone_else_having_speed_issues_with_frugal_lately/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iqa8sd/anyone_else_having_speed_issues_with_frugal_lately/">[comments]</a></span>
