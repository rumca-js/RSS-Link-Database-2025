I have an Amiga 1200 with workbench 3.0, all working, needs some screws (!!). I&#39;m looking to upgrade to a hard drive, (cf?) but wonder if they sell pre installed and I can get like wb 3.2 on it? Or is that chip. Primarily looking to play games but also want to buy a sampler for it, mainly for jungle music and retro beats - software and hardware to recommend.</p> <p>So I think I&#39;m looking at</p> <p>Compact cf card hard drive - pref pre installed or something to speed up process on PC?</p> <p>Sampler</p> <p>Accelerator and ram trapdoor thing? The 68060 I always wanted but worried about games being unplayable?</p> <p>

## Amiga was a huge part of my childhood! I put together two videos showcasing my top 30 best Amiga games of all time.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Amiga was a huge part of my childhood. In my last video, <em>15 Best Commodore Amiga Games of All Time - My Top List</em>, I left out some incredible games that definitely deserve recognition. So, I decided to make a follow-up: <em>15 More Incredible Commodore Amiga Games That Deserve a Spot in Gaming History!</em></p> <p>I know there are plenty of other amazing games that didn’t make the list. Like I said, I can easily make another video with 15 more great games!</p> <p>I don’t have my Amiga anymore. I passed it down to my younger brother. Years later, I asked him about it, but he never told me what happened to it…</p> <p>If you want to check out the video, take a look here <a href="https://youtu.be/AzMVDwxmcK8">https://youtu.be/AzMVDwxmcK8</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SirMariio"> /u/SirMariio </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iq2tfr/amiga_was_a_huge_p
