<p class="has-text-align-none">The popular Nintendo DS emulator Drastic has disappeared from the Google Play store, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/drastic-ds-emulator-removed-3526330/">reports <em>Android Authority</em></a>.  It’s not clear at the moment why the app is now gone, but it seems likely that it was the developer, not Nintendo, that prompted its removal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Developer Exophase <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091561/nintendo-lawsuit-fallout-yuzu">made Drastic free-to-download last year</a> and indicated that it planned to remove the app from Google Play and open-source its code, though that doesn’t seem to have ever happened.

<p>It seems like Nintendo just revealed its mysterious device that recently crossed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a> &mdash; and it&rsquo;s not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">the Switch 2</a>. On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the &ldquo;Alarmo&rdquo; alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p>

<p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo chara

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon won’t launch the AI-powered upgrade for Alexa for at least a month after its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606622/amazon-february-event-announced-alexa">showcase at an event</a> set for February 26th, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/14/amazon-ai-alexa-delayed/">according to <em>The Washington Post</em></a>.  The delay is reportedly at least partly because the updated assistant has issues with giving inaccurate answers to test questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An anonymous Amazon employee told the outlet that the upgrade won’t come “until March 31 or later” due to the issues. The new Alexa could be tied to a subscription, wit

<p class="has-text-align-none">The NBA has introduced a new AR feature for its Vision Pro app this week called Tabletop, which places a floating render of a basketball court in your space during “select” live games, according to an <a href="https://support.watch.nba.com/hc/en-us/articles/20891550821783-Apple-Vision-Pro#:~:text=confirm%20your%20purchase-,Tabletop%20Feature,-For%20select%20games">NBA help page</a> describing the feature.

<p>The Vision Pro is Apple&rsquo;s newest computing platform, and that means we&rsquo;re going to see a whole bunch of new apps.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boredom is something of a dying concept. Our phones, filled with games and videos and social feeds, allow us to fill every moment with <em>something</em>, whether we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re on a long flight or in line for 30 seconds waiting for coffee. But the silly and playful <em>While Waiting</em> is a good reminder that that can be a good thing &acirc;&#128;&#148; an opportunity for our minds to wander in unexpected directions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Possibly the best way to describe <em>While Waiting</em> is that it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s what would happen if <em>WarioWare</em> also tried to tell the story of a human life. Which means that it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a collection of extreme
