<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I have been using google messages since 2018 or 19, even when not using a pixel device just preferred the added internet things in the app. But now as I&#39;m degoogling I have to question. 1 does no other app offer SMS AND RCS? Pretty much everything else I&#39;ve found that has RCS is RCS only, no SMS and it also requires everyone to use the same app. Clearly not an option. Biggest thing I was previously happy to see is the progress with RCS/iOS iMessage as generally my whole family uses iphone. All that aside it truly is a welcome thing, and since having RCS and the slight integration to carry on with iPhone users as if I&#39;m one of them and actually be able to send and receive pictures or videos that aren&#39;t absolute garbage between these different devices, it&#39;s nice. But it looks like google messages is the only option for that? That being said. What&#39;s everyone&#39;s opinion?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
