When I got my first AMD card I was so excited to find &quot;Radeon Image Sharpening&quot; (I know NVIDIA has something similar) which sharpens on a driver level (afaik? please feel free to correct me). Is there an alternative to this on Linux? I know AMD Adrenaline does not exist on Linux and while I hope that changes, I don&#39;t see it happening anytime soon. I know vkBasalt exists, but if I understood correctly it might lead to problems with anti-cheat in games such as Rocket League and might also not be maintained anymore (?).</p> <p>Does anyone have any tips for me? I would love to use Linux more for gaming after I finally got gamescope with mangohud to work on desktop mode, but I cannot live without the sharpening anymore. I can&#39;t get away from dual-booting Windows either way because of some games, but slowly transitioning more and more to Linux would be awesom",
