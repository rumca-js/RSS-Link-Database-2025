<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was at a Barnes and Noble a while ago and I came upon a book. Don&#39;t know the author. Don&#39;t know the title. I was flipping through a lot of books that day. I remember that the opening line was something along the lines of &quot;Babies have killed before, but seldom is the victim someone other than the mother who bore them&quot;. I believe the next scene is the parents taking the baby to a witch who, I think, was encased in ice(?) to have her fortune read. It was fantasy. Barnes and Noble so Big 5, I assume?</p> <p>Would love to reconnect with missing novel...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AidenMarquis"> /u/AidenMarquis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iqe7zo/please_help_me_find_this_novel_by_opening_pages/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iqe7zo/please_help_me_find_this_novel_by_opening_pages/">[comme

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for books that give off a feel of dark fantasy classic horror and folklore/dark fairy tale themes. Things with witch houses in dark twisted forests, rainy and muddy weather, local hauntings in small towns.</p> <p>I have only found a few things that have hit that for me, and one of them wasn&#39;t a book, but it was the dark fantasy elements in Skyrim. I loved it so much. Its the melancholic, hidden away mysteries built into the worldbuilding that gives such a fascinating and creepy feeling. Like a tired adventurer stumbling into an unexplored corner of a haunted forest and finding a creepy house, or spending the night in a small village and learning about their local curse and superstitions, and because everyone&#39;s too scared and they&#39;ve taken care of the MC, well now of course the not-so-convinced MC feels they have to go investigate lmao, things like that.</p> <p>So if you have any recommendations for books with these themes,

I’m a deadly slow reader - I consume most novels on audio - so I don’t read ARCs (advanced reading copies) as much as I’d like to. But when I heard about these two stories, I was all in. </p> <p>First, Mr. Abercrombie. </p> <p>I’ve long been a fan of the First Law series and all the books in that world, especially BEST SERVED COLD and RED COUNTRY. When I heard about THE DEVILS, I was a bit wary — if you’ve got favorite authors, you’ll understand that slight tightening of the stomach as one of these starts a new series in a new world.</p> <p>Well,

The book was about four or five groups that ruled an underground city: the Killers (if I’m not mistaken, the leader’s name was Shade), the Thieves, the Beggars, and some other groups I don’t remember. The fmc is part of the Thieves group, and one day, she is summoned by the king to find the elves, who were supposedly in the forest. These elves were more powerful and, I think, had enhanced eyesight. I think it was like a saga of 3 books, in which, in the second one they are sent to another city(i think one of the books had a name like the queen of the city o something like that.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read a great paperback when I was a child (in the early 90s, I&#39;m old). And, because I&#39;m old, I can&#39;t remember the title or the author. But I often think about it; many real life events remind me of the vicarious experiences I had while visiting the world inside this book. The characters, the themes, and the tone sometimes seem like memories from my actual life.</p> <p>Anyway it was set in a dystopian not-too-distant future, where society was decayed and everyone pretended to be friends but backstabbed each other, just for something to do. One of the characters was a &quot;sugar baby&quot; which, in this world, was kind of like a vampire. Deceitful, poisonous, but seductive. The perfect type of person for the evil society to pretend to care about - if it would help them hurt someone else.</p> <p>As I recall, the main character wasn&#39;t so great either. Not an antihero, but more of a temporarily sympathetic victim of people who were jus

Sadly, the book had to be handed back to the library today, and although I fully intend to purchase a copy because I adored it, the ending and story is currently living rent-free in my head, and I don&#39;t have the text to refer back to answer some questions myself. Hence why I&#39;m here. Apologies if discussion of a book this old is frowned upon here - please tell me if so and I&#39;ll remove the post. Obviously, there will be spoilers - again, I&#39;ll remove if this is an issue.</p> <p>Firstly, and most importantly, can anyone explain to me the motives of Ammar, when he decides to fight with the Muwardis? It seems counter-intuitive - he tells Jehane before the duel that if he falls she should leave with Alvar, and that there is no place for her in their camp; we see

But while I read I picture everything I read in my head, and sometimes I go back and reread things, or reread the same sentence over in my head until I can picture it in my head. Does anyone else do this? And if so how long does it take you to read 100 pages? Also it’s definitely dependent on book, as I’m reading lonesome dove which as small font and a good chunk of words per page. Same thing when I read Stormlight archive, took me all day to read only about 120 pages. But when I read The rage of dragons by Evan winters I read like 180 pages per day.
