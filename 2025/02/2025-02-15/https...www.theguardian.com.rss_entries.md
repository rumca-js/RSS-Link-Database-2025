<p>The erotic reward for Chastain’s sponsorship of a Mexican dancer lights a fuse that reveals philanthropy’s toxic underside</p><p>Mexican director Michel Franco returns with a chilly, angrily intense and deeply pessimistic tale of erotic obsession among the liberal super-rich in Trump’s US who seek to launder and redeem their guilt by sponsoring the arts. It’s a really involving picture which beckons you hypnotically towards the tacit promise of a sensationally unhappy and violent denouement, and of course Franco is unlikely to deliver any other kind. The two final plot developments are shocking, if not precisely surprising, and in fact vulnerable to the charge of being crudely obvious – but Franco certainly gives us a gripping emotional drama, supercharged with toxic sensuality and fear.</p><p>Jessica Chastain plays Jennifer McCarthy, a wealthy woman based in San Francisco extensively accustomed to high-end restaurants, couture, private planes and chauffeur-driven SUVs and Franco

<p>Packed with both complicated love affairs and terribly poignant second world war scenes, it adds up to fervent television indeed</p><p>A double-episode showcase of prestige TV has now become commonplace at film festivals. It’s a bit disconcerting to stop watching two-fifths of the way in, but for those wondering if this dilutes or betrays the great cause of the big screen – well, it was good enough for David Lynch. Justin Kurzel’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North has now come to Berlin, a big, bold, complicatedly sensual epic of wartime anguish and personal reckoning, adapted by screenwriter Shaun Grant from the Booker prize winning bestseller by Richard Flanagan.</p><p>The story operates in three phases: before, during and after the second world war. Jacob Elordi is Dorrigo Evans, an Australian medical student about to ship out, engaged to a beautiful woman from a wealthy family – but he has a passionate affair with Amy (Odessa Young), the younger second wife of his uncle Keith

<p>Ambition for the women’s team – like the men’s – seems based on hanging in there until the big money starts rolling in</p><p>A couple of years ago it was reported that Daniel Levy, the man in charge of Tottenham Hotspur, was lobbying to abolish promotion and relegation to and from the Women’s Super League. Levy’s vision was of a steady-state league, with no mobility and therefore no real jeopardy, where the same teams competed for the same stuff every season. How we laughed. As it turned out, he needn’t have gone to the trouble. It pretty much ended up happening anyway.</p><p>For Tottenham at least, a season that began replete with possibility has buffed down to a blunt point. Marooned in mid-table, eliminated from both cup competitions, safe from relegation and well out of the Champions League race, their last nine games – starting with the north London derby at the Emirates on Sunday – are essentially pure content, dead rubbers, puff football.

<p>A host of Saturday Night Live cast members and music stars hit New York on Valentine’s Day for a mammoth 50th anniversary concert</p><p>It seems like a daunting task, to sum up 50 years of music in one night. But when you harbor its cultural cachet, the respect artists have for Saturday Night Live and its stunningly expansive rolodex, as well as the shear production power of both SNL honcho Lorne Michaels and producer Mark Ronson, the result is a three-hour-plus extravaganza to rival even the starriest, most packed Grammys, Oscars or its ilk.</p><p>Coming in from New York’s bitter chill on Valentine’s night, the chosen venue was Radio City Music Hall, a perfect home considering its Rockefeller Center confines are not only a hop, skip and a jump from SNL’s Studio 8H at nearby NBC Studios. Its art deco space serves as the epitome of New York City: a tourist mecca beloved by hardscrabble locals. So it seemed natural that the Rockettes and SNL would both grace its hallowed stage at on

Here they deliver a full-blown album as a duo, taking the migration of nightingales as their inspiration and following one’s calling as their theme. It’s a gentle, captivating work, its poetic songs soaked in nature imagery and beautifully married to Sissoko’s intricate, dazzling playing. Also present here and there is cellist Vincent Ségal, with further guests on the lute-like ngoni and guembri<em> </em>weaving subtly through the backing.</p><p>Faccini’s high, reedy vocals are not the sturdiest, but he’s in robust form here.

<p>The US vice-president was hypocritical and insensitive, but bracingly clear in his resetting of relationships</p><p>Since 1963, the Munich Security Conference has seen many consequential speeches, notably Vladimir Putin announcing in 2007 that Russia would never accept a subordinate role in the new world order. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-stuns-munich-conference-with-blistering-attack-on-europes-leaders">Friday’s speech by JD Vance</a>, the US vice-president, has the potential to be the most consequential – the moment the world order against which Putin railed fell apart.</p><p>Sometimes, even in this digital age, speeches can act as clarifiers. Yes, the 22 minutes were full of laughable hypocrisy, distorted portraits of European democracy and insensitivity to Europe’s trauma with fascism, but for what it said about the chasm in values between most in Europe and the Trump administration, it was hard to overlook.</p> <a href="https://www.th

<p>Praise the braise, and meld rich, fusion flavours into cosy winter comfort food</p><p>Braising is a transformative and uncomplicated way of cooking. It’s particularly suited to cosier cooking during the frigid months, or for unflustered catering for a crowd. When simmered gently in flavourful liquids at a low temperature, even the toughest of meats and the hardiest vegetables and pulses are coaxed into yielding, delicious comfort food. The beauty of a braise is how both the broth and the main ingredient are enriched when they linger together for some time, not to mention that it is also mostly hands-off cooking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/15/braised-coconut-chicken-hispi-beans-pork-pineapple-braise-recipes-ravinder-bhogal">Continue reading...</a>

In the case of John Hughes’ ur-teen-flick The Breakfast Club, still bratty four decades after its zeitgeist-capturing theatrical run, its headlining truth that teenagers possess depth beyond their broad archetypes has since been re-realized ad nauseam by generations of on-screen adolescents. (Smaller, ancillary truths, such as the binding potential of cannabis to bridge inter-clique divides, are where the film really shines.) Of recent vintage, high school crowd-pleasers Booksmart and Bottoms both learned the hard way that the pretty, popular girls descended from Molly Ring

<p>The delusions and desires of a precocious young boy are closely observed as he approaches his senior school years</p><p>Michael Amherst’s startling debut opens with a quiet description of the unnamed, unmistakably English town in which the novel’s action takes place. Amherst’s narrator is a faithful tour guide, keen that we don’t miss the preparatory school, where the headteacher is the father of our 12-year-old protagonist, Daniel, or the abbey with its Norman tower. Three rivers traverse the town and every winter they “break their banks and flood the surrounding fields” so that all&nbsp;becomes “hemmed in and dark with&nbsp;water”. Throughout this taut bildungsroman, threats of inundation appear regularly, powerfully underlining the pressures to contain the self and the desire for freedom integral to Daniel’s development.</p><p>Amherst’s Daniel is a richly realised child protagonist. The novel’s enigmatic title carries with it a sense of innocence before experience, and, indeed,

<p>I lost my own husband at a young age. It’s rare (and v.g.) to see a heroine trying to live joyfully despite her grief</p><p>Bridget Jones is back and once again blazing a new path, this time as a widow. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/07/mad-about-the-boy-bridget-jones-an-oscar">Mad About the Boy</a>, our eternally chaotic but lovable everywoman is navigating single parenthood, dating apps and grief. But unlike most widows in romcoms, she’s not here to wither away in a beige cardigan, politely mourning until society deems it acceptable for her to love again. Instead, she’s in bed with a 29-year-old park ranger named Roxster, proving that healing doesn’t have to be quiet reflection – it can also look like great sex with a younger man.</p><p>This is where Bridget breaks the mould. In most romantic comedies, women’s grief is pitched as a problem to be solved. We must undergo a period of deep self-reflection before we are allowed back into the world of desire. We

<p>Treacle tart is one of life’s great pleasures, and it makes clever use of stale bread, too</p><p>Treacle tart is a great way to turn a bread crust into a treat. I made mine with a crust each of Danish rye and wholemeal spelt sourdough, and it was incredibly rich and flavourful.</p><p><strong>Treacle tart</strong><br>
 Put 200g plain flour and 100g chilled, diced salted butter in a large bowl, then rub with your fingertips until it looks like breadcrumbs. Stir in 50g sugar (I used soft brown), then mix in a beaten egg and knead lightly until the pastry comes together (add a splash of cold water to help, if necessary). Put the dough in a tub, cover and chill for about half an hour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/15/turn-old-bread-crust-into-treacle-tart-recipe-tom-hunt-zero-waste-cooking">Continue reading...</a>

I take to the oak throne that we have on the farm, and scan the view</p><p>It’s a bright morning with a light frost sparkling on the meadow. The traffic noise from the nearby dual carriageway is louder than normal, oppressive in this rural scene. There are lots of deer prints here, the two toes making that characteristic heart shape. Roe deer and muntjac intermingled, making neat little paths, deer motorways, tracking through the field.</p><p>My daughter says she saw a fawn grazing here yesterday and, at first, I thought she must be mistaken – it’s far too early – until I remembered that muntjacs give birth&nbsp;all year round. And so I take to the large throne of a seat that we&nbsp;have here, hewn by my Dad out&nbsp;of a massive piece of oak. I&nbsp;climb up and perch on it, feeling small in its expanse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/15/country-d
