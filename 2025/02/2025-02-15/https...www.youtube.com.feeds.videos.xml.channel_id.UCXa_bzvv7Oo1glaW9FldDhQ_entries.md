With the development team promising over 30 bosses and more than 30 hours of gameplay, having it come out of nowhere like this and suddenly generate buzz is reminiscent of Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong.

However, as it turns out, the two games share a connection beyond gorgeous visuals and sleek action. With that said, can Tides of Annihilation achieve the same levels of success? Find out more here.
