She doesn\u2019t have many friends and spends most of her free time on her phone. We thought it would be great to read something, discuss our opinions and spend time together making crafts or baking treats based on the book, basically - not looking for quality literary works - just something fun we both would enjoy.</p> <p>I\u2019m 20 and my little sister is 16. I would appreciate if the book recommendations were age appropriate, she doesn\u2019t really enjoy anything explicit and always skips \u201cspicy\u201d scenes in movies. </p> <p>I can read anything and enjoy it so the main problem is finding something my sister would like. I suggested fantasy, contemporary and classics - she said no to all. </p> <p>I know she loves the Hunger Games and Twilight movies. Her \u201clikes\u201d on Letterboxd include Twisters, Gran Turismo, Scream, Mean Girls, Knives Out, The Craft. She\u2019s currently obsessed with \u201cAlice In Bord",

Does anyone know any good recommendations? I love a good slow burn, enemies to lovers, all types of fantasy. I read Crier&#39;s war and loved it. I also am a huge hunger games lover. I like when there is a main plot with a sub plot of romance and it has to have a good happy ending where they are endgame.

It&#39;s a book full of crime-related riddles in the style of sudoku, with not a very consistent storyline. The main character is a detective who stumbles upon murders everywhere he goes, and the reader must help him with solving them. My only issue with the book is how repetitive the riddles get after a while, not changing their styles and rules for way too long.</p> <p>Are there any more books like this by different authors? Ideally not so difficult that I would get frustrated, but also not too easy and repetitive (meaning different types of puzzles). Just something to keep the brain going.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SmallRoot\"> /u/SmallRoot </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iqeuos/looking_for_books_similar_to_murdle_by_g_t_karber/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/b",

I haven\u2019t read the ACOTAR series yet, so I plan to bring the first book with me. </p> <p>I\u2019d love recommendations for cozy, steamy reads to enjoy during our weekend away. I really don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re light-hearted or more of a thriller, as long as they fit the vibe, I\u2019ll take any suggestions!

When I was growing up I spent all my free time devouring books, up until adulthood when I started having kids. Now I realize it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve really read for pleasure. This year I decided to make it a goal to get back into reading. I grabbed a book from my shelf that had survived the many purges of my parent life; Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami. A great book, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I couldn&#39;t help but feel like it was a book for a twenty year old. Someone younger. It was almost like that feeling you get when you age out of those &quot;coming of age&quot; novels you read a million of in seventh grade.

I really like creepy elements but I also don\u2019t like pure jumpscares or horror for the sake of horror. I loooooved Monstrilio and still searching for something along those vibes. Not only weird but also very touching and beautifully written. I have been reading Cackle and it just doesn\u2019t hit. The weird is there but the tender is absent. I also hate books where the author uses basic metaphors like \u201cwarm like Kashmir\u201d or \u201cskin the color of caramel\u201d. Sorry about the random rant but nobody over the age of 18 should be writing like that &amp; I can\u2019t find even the most tender of stories touching if this is the author\u2019s style \ud83d\ude02.
