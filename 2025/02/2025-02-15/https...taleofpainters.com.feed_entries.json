        "description": "<p>In recent years, we've seen a surge of new and impressive paint ranges, each claiming to outdo its competitors. This leaves me wondering: can acrylic paints for modelling improve further, or have we hit the ceiling? Big Child Creative also pondered this question, and their answer is their new Ionic Smart Paint, which you may have already seen in videos by Ninjon and Vince Venturella with their development name \u201cAtom Smart Paints\u201d. For this review, I tested the entire range with all 180 colours to explore whether Ionic represents the next evolutionary leap in miniature painting and the role that the Citadel Colour range of the 2000s plays in all of this.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/02/review-ionic-smart-colors/\">Review: Ionic Smart Colors</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
