## Disliking religion is NOT just about religious trauma

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a small rant, but every time the topic of why the LGBT community dislikes Abrahamic religions comes up, the explanation I often hear is: <em>&quot;People just have religious trauma.&quot;</em> </p> <p>I find this explanation frustrating. While it‚Äôs not entirely untrue ‚Äîsome people do dislike religion due to personal trauma‚ÄîI think it reduces queer criticism of religion to an impulsive, irrational and personal reaction. This, inadvertently for the most part, erases the very real and systemic harm that Abrahamic religions have inflicted on our ommunity. </p> <p>There‚Äôs a dozens of holy texts morally preaching against our existence, a hundred countries where religion is harmful to our rights, a thousand year long history of religious persecution of queer people, hundreds of thousands churches and mosques advocating against us, millions of believers flocking to the polls to erase our existence . </p> <p>We have as many reasons to dislike religion
