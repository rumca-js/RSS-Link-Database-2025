My bot caches information so that it doesn\u2019t have to constantly make api requests per player request I make. So my bot calls that real time api request. I currently get 200 status code on every api but the player requests, which I get 403 on. It uses curl_cffi and stealthapi client. What is a better way to go about this? I think curl_cffi is interfering with it a bit much with the impersonation and causing the 403</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/darthvadersRevenge\"> /u/darthvadersRevenge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iqd4lo/when_webscraping_a_website_what_is_best_used_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iqd4lo/when_webscraping_a_website_what_is_best_used_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So as bit of a hobby project I&#39;m pulling some data from teh ESPN rugby pages - and I&#39;m having toruble with the data that is loaded via on page interactions.</p> <p>The page I&#39;m looking at is <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/playerstats?gameId=600250&amp;league=180659\">this one</a>. I&#39;m able to access the base Scoring stats, but I can&#39;t seem to trigger the load for the Attacking/Defending/Discipline stats. I know about selenium in concept but the thing I can&#39;t figure out is how to identify the elements to then interact with on the page. I&#39;ve tried using the XPATH and finding elements by Name, but it&#39;s not working.</p> <p>Any help able to point me to how to interact with those elements would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
