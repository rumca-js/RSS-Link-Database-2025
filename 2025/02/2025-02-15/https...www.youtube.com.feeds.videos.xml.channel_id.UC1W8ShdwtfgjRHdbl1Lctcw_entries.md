I colorized and created a sound design for this rare video of Berlin in the 1930s, capturing everyday life before World War II. The footage showcases bustling streets filled with double-decker buses, trolleys, and automobiles moving in both directions. Pedestrians navigate the sidewalks, passing by the iconic Woolworth store, a popular shopping destination of the time.
