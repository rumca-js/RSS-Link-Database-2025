<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to webscrape a sports website for player data. My bot caches information so that it doesnâ€™t have to constantly make api requests per player request I make. So my bot calls that real time api request. I currently get 200 status code on every api but the player requests, which I get 403 on. It uses curl_cffi and stealthapi client. What is a better way to go about this? I think curl_cffi is interfering with it a bit much with the impersonation and causing the 403</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/darthvadersRevenge"> /u/darthvadersRevenge </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iqd4lo/when_webscraping_a_website_what_is_best_used_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iqd4lo/when_webscraping_a_website_what_is_best_used_to/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m quite new to this whole scraping thing - mainly using it as a means to learn to do things with Python and PowerBI. So as bit of a hobby project I&#39;m pulling some data from teh ESPN rugby pages - and I&#39;m having toruble with the data that is loaded via on page interactions.</p> <p>The page I&#39;m looking at is <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/playerstats?gameId=600250&amp;league=180659">this one</a>. I&#39;m able to access the base Scoring stats, but I can&#39;t seem to trigger the load for the Attacking/Defending/Discipline stats. I know about selenium in concept but the thing I can&#39;t figure out is how to identify the elements to then interact with on the page. I&#39;ve tried using the XPATH and finding elements by Name, but it&#39;s not working.</p> <p>Any help able to point me to how to interact with those elements would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to develop a plugin for Selenium in Python with the goal of mimicking human-like behaviour when interacting with a page through the mouse cursor. So like, moving the mouse to reach elements to click.</p> <p>Do you have any suggestions for an algorithm that can create human-like cursor patterns from point A to B?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/St3veR0nix"> /u/St3veR0nix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ipxkdk/python_selenium_plugin_for_humanlike_cursor/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ipxkdk/python_selenium_plugin_for_humanlike_cursor/">[comments]</a></span>
