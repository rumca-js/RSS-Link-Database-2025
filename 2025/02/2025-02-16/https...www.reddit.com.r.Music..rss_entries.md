<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My 9 year son is getting into metal, but prefers instrumental music. I was hoping to get some suggestions on some good albums/artists for him. I love fostering his interests! He likes songs from the Halo soundtrack, daft punk, and Molchat Doma. He also has an appreciation for old Metallica. Basically he loves that fast, power chord, epic guitar solo late 80s sound, but no vocals. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Thabks dudes. My son is stoked. I’ll respond to comments of the next few days as we listen to some stuff. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Electronic_Nobody474"> /u/Electronic_Nobody474 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ir430y/instrumental_metal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ir430y/instrumental_metal/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don’t like to share my opinions or preach, but this seems worthy of discussion.</p> <p>After careful consideration, I decided to cancel my Spotify Premium subscription, which I started around 2014. Over the last few years, the service shifted from a music-centric platform to something with bigger aspirations: podcasts, audiobooks, video, and even social-like elements.</p> <p>I get it—companies need to diversify to stay competitive in a brutally fast-paced market. But I started asking myself: how much of my subscription fee actually goes to the artists I love? The short answer is: very little, and even less if they’re not backed by a major label.
