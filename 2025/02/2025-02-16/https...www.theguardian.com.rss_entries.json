        "description": "<p><strong>Riverside Studios, London</strong><br>Adapted from a French bestseller, this fictional story of Martin, who missed out on the role of a lifetime, becomes a meditation on how lives are changed</p><p>Martin has a meltdown during his pregnant partner\u2019s 12-week scan. For reasons he can\u2019t divine, the prospect of fatherhood is dredging up his childhood demons, specifically the lingering humiliation of being passed over for the film role of Harry Potter when he was 10. These flashbacks trigger a reappraisal of a life lived in the shadow of the Potter franchise that has dogged Martin like an inescapable flock of Dementors.</p><p>If this sounds like a slender premise, don\u2019t be fooled. Adapted by Barney Norris from David Foenkinos\u2019s bestselling 2022 French novel, directed by Michael Longhurst, <em>Second Best</em> is a deceptively unassuming play. What starts out like a comical but mundane monologue soon becomes an elegant meditation on the misshapen nature of trauma.</p> <a href=\"h",

When he returned to office, the House of Representatives was already under his heel. Many of the House Republican leaders had been his sidekicks during January 6, and one, Mark Johnson, had since become the speaker. The Senate, however, still retained, for the most part, its club-like atmosphere where the members considered themselves powers unto themselves. Senators with a toga complex have always looked down on House members as rabble. Trump viewed the independent character of the upper body as a thorn in his side. The subservience of the House of Representatives was the model that Trump envisioned for the Senate. It could no longer pretend to be the greatest deliberative body of legislators in the world, but a vassal fiefdom subject to his whims.</p><p>Trump\u2019s opportunity to crush the",
