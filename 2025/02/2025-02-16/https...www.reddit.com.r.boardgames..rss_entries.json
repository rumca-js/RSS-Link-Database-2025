I really want to try Silent Victory after watching some Youtubers. Having said that, I found the game (3rd Printing) for $60 or $38 for P500 price. I&#39;m trying to work out what P500 means. Is that for Pre-order? Does the &quot;$60&quot; mean that they&#39;ve broken the 500th buyer? And how can I find one that I can buy RIGHT NOW? I have so many questions about this hobby!

I couldn&#39;t really find anything online, even on the Planhart site.</p> <p>Additionally, the rebus puzzle at the end feels incomplete, too. The shapes &gt;! have nothing to do with the solution. !&lt; However, we started to find a possible solution that makes sense: &gt;! In (N) the box (square), [TOOTH] around? (circle), [E, diamond], try (triangle) for (4), hearts? (heart, S), the start (star, T) !&lt;</p> <p>We think it has something to do with opening &gt;! the right chamber, ",
