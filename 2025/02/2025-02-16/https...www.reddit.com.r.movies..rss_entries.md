I loved that movie and after it I became a big Transformers fan, watching whatever movies and clips I could find online at that age. It even spilled into my other hobbies like gaming and music; I started listening to Linkin Park (still do) and played whatever games had transformers in them. I remember playing Fall of Cybertron a lot on my Xbox 360. Got as many Transformer toys and figures I could get. Just saying I was a fan would be an understatement.</p> <p>As I got a couple of years older I started watching the other movies as they released.

I think parts like the months going by could be parts where you do stuff around the outpost like maintenance and maybe even tending to the garden just to add in some content. I feel there are elements that could really work well in a game like the shooting at the outposts or attacking/defending yourself when you&#39;re down at the bottom of the gorge.

And omg that poor girl who finally got him arrested was so brave. They say he could have killed as many as 130 women and girls but was only charged for 12 killings. Of course no DNA then but still the police were so dismissive of the women who reported him. So aggravating! Anyway wondered what anyone else who watched it thought.

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the main character gets a call saying nuclear war is coming in less than 70 minutes, and I&#39;m sitting there thinking someone was playing a prank. I was not ready for the movie to shift into an apocalyptic thriller. The shift in tone was so unexpected that I just sat there watching for the next hour or so, completely baffled.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonny_the_Rocket"> /u/Jonny_the_Rocket </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iqsuw9/which_movies_have_had_the_most_drastic_shifts_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iqsuw9/which_movies_have_had_the_most_drastic

It really holds up after 25 years.</p> <p>I love how they bonded together over writing stories. And how I wish I could understand- it was clear that the subtitles are conveying barely 70% of the meaning, if that. </p> <p>I guess it&#39;s not fair to compare a movie like this to the toxic schlock of hateful gender and racial ideology that is Babygirl, but it just so happens we saw them a couple of weeks apart and so comparisons were inevitable.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I usually hate rating and reviewing older films, due to the fact that the era and standards for films were so different back then, it feels like you have to overlook many things or give them the benefit of the doubt in certain areas due to them being so old. However, I found AQOTWF to be a great film regardless of its era and time. </p> <p>It&#39;s a great anti-war film that truly hammers its message home. It takes an innocent and insensible 17-year-old student who gets influenced to join the army by his school teacher. Being told how it&#39;s such a great honor and privilege to die for your country. He starts out as a happy, positive kid who wants to serve his country and his people, and quickly becomes a traumatized, shell of himself. </p> <p>The message was depicted rather thoroughly, giving us many soliloquies and pieces of dialogue from characters expressing their somber thoughts. As well as the brilliant battle sequence scenes, this film really

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To me it comes down to two things. Pace and depth.</p> <p>Most movies I watch at this point either have one or the other. </p> <p>There’s the high pace movie that gives you action or drama repeatedly, with no substance to make you care.</p> <p>Then there’s the deep movie that pushes you to care about the characters involved, which you do to start based on the honesty delivered, before becoming uninterested as the camera focuses on a disgruntled shop employee for 45 seconds.</p> <p>What makes Anora so great is that it seems to effortlessly brings both. Particularly from the moment there are knocks on the front door of the house. </p> <p>From then on, it’s driven by pure madness you can’t keep your eyes off of, while continuing to deliver a depth of character and story via the reality of the chaotic situation.</p> <p>If you haven’t seen it, go watch it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cahtahbahnd"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’d be lying if nostalgia didn’t play a HUGE part in this but just rewatched cheaper by the dozen and I loved every fucking second. As a soon to be dad I honestly teared up a few times. </p> <p>General thoughts:</p> <p>1) Steve Martin is in his prime. The man is just funny, IMO way above Ben stiller or Adam Sandler who I often hear hes compared to “Of his time” </p> <p>2) The whole Mark character arc throughout the movie already knowing he’s the outlier hits way harder. He shows signs of being an outcast like 12 minutes in but didn’t know it til you knew it!</p> <p>3) The plot line in general is very solid, two parents trying to live their dreams at the same time, inconveniently, but figuring out a way to make it work. And making sacrifices for their family- Shake: “giving up the dream?” Coach: “Just going with a different one” 🥹</p> <p>And all with a tolerable cast. Like Jesus, today these movies are so bad and just unwatchable. Cheaper by the dozen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This weekend, I watched two new movies, reviews unseen. Both were surprisingly good. 1. The Gorge - well-done sci-fi/action/romance. The two leads were interesting with good chemistry. The production, photography and special effects were superb. Loved every minute of it. 2. Past Lives - this story takes place during three intervals, each 12 years apart. The three leads were excellent, perfectly cast. An emotional roller coaster. Highly recommended. The Gorge was on AppleTV+. Part Lives was on Amazon Prime. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MacJeff2018"> /u/MacJeff2018 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iqklg9/two_excellent_recent_movies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iqklg9/two_excellent_recent_movies/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Went and recently watched this Jason Statham movie and thought it was pretty good. He plays as a security guard who works for a security company and had an armored vehicle being robbed during a hiest. One of the robbers went and shot his son, so he went and seek revenge. The movie felt like it dragged a little long, because of the acts that were flashbacks that were already shown from the beginning of the film, but I guess its there to simply remind the audience about what happened and how the story went down. It even had an interesting twist on it, too, at the near ending, where Bullet was revealed to be the inside man and turned on his own teammates. Not to mention, I never expected to see Post Malone in the film, too, as a robber lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Problem9163"> /u/Ok-Problem9163 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iqjajn/the_wrath_of_men_20
