<p>Alan Siegel at The Ringer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ahead of ‘SNL50,’ we asked Amy Poehler, Seth Meyers, Bill Hader,
and more to tell us which of their sketches they hold closest to
their hearts. [...]</p>

<p>There’s no magic formula, but the most transcendent sketches — the ones we reference and quote, even years later — often share
two traits. Just ask Seth Meyers, the show’s head writer and
“Weekend Update” anchor for a decade. “A lot of great <em>SNL</em>
sketches are both obvious and unexpected,” he says. “You have to
combine the two to make it rise above what, you know, could be a
<em>very good</em> sketch.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fun read with some great video clips. Really looking forward to the SNL50 special tonight.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc.’s long-promised overhaul for the Siri digital assistant
is facing engineering problems and software bugs, threatening to
postpone or limit its release, according to people with knowledge
of the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shocker.</p>

<p>New research published from Apple machine learning researchers Yuhan Hu, Peide Huang, Mouli Sivapurapu, Jian Zhang:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nonverbal behaviors such as posture, gestures, and gaze are
essential for conveying internal states, both consciously and
unconsciously, in human interaction. For robots to interact more
naturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise
integrate expressive qualities — such as intention, attention,
and emotions — alongside traditional functional considerations
like task fulfillment, spatial constraints, and time efficiency.
In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a
lamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and
expressive objectives in movement design.</p>

<p>I enjoyed seeing something Luxo-esque made real, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12493">the paper itself</a> is fairly readable — and worth skimming at least for the illustrations. But I’ll wait for an actual product to get
