Avowed Character Guide - BEST Abilities, Skills & Stats (How to Make a Build in Avowed)
In this Avowed video, I'm going to be going through the attributes and abilities of characters in this game, trying to give you guys some useful information from the hours upon hours of the game I have already played. So just to kind of help you make better decisions about what sort of character you want to make to help you either theory craft or just kind of guide you during the early stages of the game.
