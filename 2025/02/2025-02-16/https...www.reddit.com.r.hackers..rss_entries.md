<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My phone died a few months back. then my iCloud disconnected from the device on its own....then eventually the Instagram Account that i was now using on my PC was hacked and I did not even get a security email. the Hack was seamless, so it seems. even the associated accounts are gone too. i created another account, i dd not personalise it i just used it to watch music reels. It was hacked too, got an email on this one, but IG self help is no good for me...for some reason</p> <p>MY QUESTION is... am I now a long term practise monkey for a random hacker?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/spectator_2_0"> /u/spectator_2_0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iqlil7/have_i_been_randomly_targetted/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iqlil7/have_i_been_randomly_targetted/">[comments]</a></span>
