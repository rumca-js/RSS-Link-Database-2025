I kept reading for the next 3 hours.</p> <p>The Saint of Bright Doors amazed me in so many ways. It&#39;s incredibly well written, and it subverts expectations fabulously. It&#39;s queer, South Asian, definitively fantasy while having all modern technology, it subverts Chose One tropes down to the atom. Some parts are harrowing to read after the pandemic.</p> <p>The premise of The Saint of Bright doors is that Fetter, the son of a Saint (a de facto god), the Perfect and Kind, is raised by his mother to kill his father. Instead, Fetter flees his destiny, and settles down in the city of Luriat, and needs to now live with the trauma of his upbringing and his newfound directionlessness. </p> <p>I really liked",

I am extremely picky when it comes to most media and found that I have really been enjoying LitRPG books. I really like the concept of following 1 person get stronger and stronger, awesome fights and constantly unlocking new and interesting abilities. However, I feel like you could get this similar concept without the game like pieces. I do like the game mechanics but I don&#39;t necessarily need game mechanics like levelling up and all that jazz. </p> <p>I really love solo character books, like the start of <em>Defiance of the Fall</em> or the solo levelling in <em>Primal Hunter</em>, with those cool wow moments when others see their power. What usually throws me off, though, is when these books start getting too big.

For example: Kushiel\u2019s Dart or Daughter of the Blood. I\u2019m not against sex scenes or anything (as long as it\u2019s well done) but I\u2019m always through Daughter of the Blood and EVERYTHING is the book is sort of sex-related, which is interested at first, but only at first. And I think Kushiel\u2019s Dart is also very erotic, which is not what I\u2019m looking for, though I really enjoy the dark themes that come with it sometimes. Anyway! I\u2019m more interested in fantasy like Gentlemen Bastards, The Witcher or The Poppy War, yk. If it\u2019s dark the better, but I\u2019m a sucker for funny, witty, sarcastic and unhinged characters. </p> <p>So, to put it shortly: epic fantasy that is",

As a result werebeasts are able to have children with each other and humans. That said it&#39;s still possible to turn other humans by biting them.</li> </ol> ",

For background, I haven\u2019t completed a book in 2 years, and haven\u2019t found a fantasy or sci-fi book that clicked with me since I started \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d 6 years ago. One of my goals for 2025 is to complete 10 books. I play a lot of dnd and enjoy fantasy elements in general which is why I\u2019m really wanting to find a fantasy or sci-fi book that really clicks with me. The problem is: I haven\u2019t yet. </p> <p>Q3 of last year, I began this journey by picking up \u201cTheft of Swords\u201d by Michael J. Sullivan. I dropped it because although I liked the pace and the dynamic between the characters, it felt very generic and I felt like there were better books out there I could be reading (here\u2019s hoping this thread proves me right).</p> <p>I put reading aside as I got busy with my education, until early January where I picked up \u201cName of the Wind\u201d fr",

Not anything as classic and old as Lord of the rings though, or anything George R.R Martin.</p> <p>What I\u2019m looking to read is something captivating, to make me not want to put the book down, good world building, maybe something like Suicide Squad but make it good fantasy. I like thrilling books, good plot, I like romance too, can be a subplot though I don\u2019t mind. </p> <p>I don\u2019t necessarily like \u2018 good guy \u2018 main character, or \u2018 good guys win \u2018 trope. I enjoy versatile characters, very morally grey, very twisted sense of justice, don\u2019t like all ultimatum thinking: you either right, or wrong.

As many of us know, <a href=\"/r/fantasy\">r/fantasy</a> has come storming out defending Naomi King without having heard the story from both parts. And there have been some people on Reddit trying to emphasize that, especially on <a href=\"/r/fantasy\">r/fantasy</a>. So, the last couple of days, people on Reddit claimed that they&#39;d gotten banned on <a href=\"/r/fantasy\">r/fantasy</a> for that reason. Because that is just not okay if you think about all the people that have defended Naomi on here, which haven&#39;t been touched. Anyways, the alleged bans happened on the 14th and 15th of February. So, with the new Naomi King video out, where Naomi proves that Daniel might not be as guilty as some might have thought, I&#39;m thinking about those now-famous texts in our community that I would guess ruin Naomi&#39;s legal chances.

I&#39;m guessing the winner is some long-running literary franchise, like Oz, the Tolkien Legendarium, Choose Your Own Adventure or Dungeons &amp; Dragons (not exactly literary). Other possibilities: Mario, Zork, Ultima, Well World, the World Of Darkness, In The Realms Of The Unreal, the Buffyverse. I&#39;m just listing franchises to get the neurons firing. Technically, mega-crossover franchises like M.U.G.E.N., Robot Chicken, YouTube Poop &amp; Undocumented Features have the most, but that&#39;s kind-of a copout.</p> <p>To be clear, I am asking which franchise contains the most fantasy species. Is Warcraft a serious contender? I admit that I know very little about Warcraft.
