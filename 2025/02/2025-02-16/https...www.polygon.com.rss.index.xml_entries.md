<p class="has-text-align-none">Few actors in history have ever had a period as truly, proudly, wonderfully crotchety as the run Harrison Ford has been on over the last 20 or so years. One of the most famous people in the world and one of the most gifted and incredible movie stars ever, Ford is still, above all else, a working actor, and being a working actor means getting paid. And from time to time, that’s exactly his approach. Over the last two decades, he’s frequently <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/entertainment/harrison-ford-admits-movies-money-films-succeed">made no bones</a> of the <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-capt

The Marvel universe is composed of many different origins and cultures, and it’s impressive to see <em>Marvel Rivals</em> reflect that with such a diverse playable character roster. Marvel writers take real-life cultures and implements elements of their legends and stories to create new characters th

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third Paddington movie, <em>Paddington in Peru</em>, is a worthy addition to the franchise, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/opinion/521772/paddington-in-peru-villains-review-good">just as much humor and almost as much heart as its predecessors</a>. Most of the cast members return to their roles, with one big exception: Sally Hawkins, who played family matriarch Mary Brown in the first two movies, decided this movie was <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/global/antonio-banderas-olivia-colman-rachel-zegler-emily-mortimer-paddington-in-peru-1235652989/">“the right time”</a> to depart the

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>In 2012, </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24194393/roger-ebert-video-games-are-not-art"><em>Roger Ebert wrote</em></a><em>, “I remain convinced that in principle, video games cannot be art.” The question of what is or isn’t art feels tired in 2025, but the ever-shifting defenses of </em><strong><em>why</em></strong> <em>can still be intriguing. In this interview excerpt, game designer Sam Barlow and podcaster Justin McElroy explore Ebert’s reasoning for saying that video games couldn’t be art: the fact that video games are, to some degree, mutable.&nbsp;</em></p>
