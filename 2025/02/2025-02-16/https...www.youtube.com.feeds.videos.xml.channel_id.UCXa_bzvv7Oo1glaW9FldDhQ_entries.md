In a world where a never-ending stream of new video games is constantly being released, there are scenarios for console players that at least some of the titles they want to play won’t make it to their favourite platform. 

This isn’t so true for PC players, as practically every game – a handful of Sony console exclusives aside – releases to PC at some point. This year, like any other, is stuffed with exceptional PC releases, and we’ve attempted to compile the fifteen most worth looking forward to – including frantic first-person shooters, story-driven RPGs, action-adventures, and co-operative roguelikes – there’s plenty here to add to your wish list no matter your taste in video games.

Techland’s Dying Light was released all the way back in 2015 and quickly went on to become one of the best games that year. It was a natural succession of the ideas that were seen in its previous works. 

Borrowing gameplay mechanics from Dead Island, and that coupled with a densely packed open world and an innovative movement system helped Dying Light stand out from contemporaries of the genre. More than 10 years later, it continues to be held in high regard by fans and it surprisingly holds up to this day. 

But why exactly is that? We answer exactly that question in this video.

If you want an RPG that completely changes the way you look at the genre, or perhaps one that takes your breath away with its sheer depth, complexity, and reactivity, Avowed may very well let you down. But that’s not the sort of game that it’s trying to be. Avowed is perfectly content to follow the RPG rulebook, to keep things compact and simple, and to focus on its key strengths- and the end result is an RPG that might not be the most original or groundbreaking, but one that delivers an undeniably enjoyable and compelling experience, nonetheless. 

Combat, exploration, world-building, characters, writing- all of these are areas where RPGs need to succeed in most circumstances, and Avowed impresses on each front.
