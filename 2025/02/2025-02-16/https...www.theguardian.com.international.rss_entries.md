But in 2025, it is particularly profound – mostly because of the Americans.</p><p>Since the last time Canada played the US at an elite tournament in 2016, Canadians have watched the American program grow stronger and deeper, while Canada’s own has lost focus. Among the most pressing going concerns has been goaltending. Canada – or Québec more accurately – produced dominant goalies in excess for decades. No longer.

<p>Reports reveal the true harm done by incarcerating women under the guise of protecting them</p><p>Every now and then I learn something about the world today that sticks into me like a fish hook and I find myself asking friends, colleagues, “Wait, did you know this?

It’s the part of the film, about a third of the way in, where a woman is locked up with the lie that the incarceration is for her own good.</p><p>It’s not just films, of course, not just fiction – countless women were institutionalised in the 19th century for “abnormal” behaviours, like disagreeing with their husbands, or following “unnatural” sexual impulses. Some were locked up for postnatal depression, some alcoholism, some “moral insanity”, which meant, somehow, infidelity. But what shocked me even more than historical reports on women like Elizabeth Packard, who was incarcerated by her husband in 1860 (the doctor’s reasons included he
