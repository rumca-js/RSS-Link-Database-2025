By blending into Microsoft 365 traffic, attackers avoid detection while targeting a South American ministry.</p> <p>The attack begins with PathLoader, which installs the FinalDraft backdoor. Instead of sending actual emails, the backdoor uses Outlook drafts to communicate with the attacker\u2019s infrastructure, hiding commands and responses in draft emails (r_&lt;session-id&gt;, p_&lt;session-id&gt;). After execution, drafts are deleted, making it difficult to trace.
