Soil moisture sensors are essential for successful working with plants. In video #207, I showed some of the most common sensors. Some of them were bad, and some were ok. In the meantime, I discovered a new sensor type that promises accuracy and more data. These sensors are also waterproof and can be buried. So, letâ€™s check them out. We will also learn about the RS485 and Modbus interface and how to connect such sensors to MQTT and Home Assistant.
