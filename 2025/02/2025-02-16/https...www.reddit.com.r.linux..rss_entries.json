Ideally i don&#39;t want to dual boot on my current PC and would rather have a separate system to experiment with. I am thinking of looking for a second hand slightly older Thinkpad. Would this be a a good idea for a system to try? I have heard that Thinkpad&#39;s are a good for this but im not sure if there would be something better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Heyo028\"> /u/Heyo028 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iqrb7o/looking_to_try_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iqrb7o/looking_to_try_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",
