<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m building a pvp game for leetcode. How it runs code is that for every submission, it spins up a container, copies the code to a file and runs it. It works fine for Python, but it can get extremely slow for Java and C++, which I&#39;m guessing is because of the image + compile time. I could just have one container up all the time and just run the code there but I&#39;m afraid someone can write &quot;system(&quot;shutdown&quot;);&quot; and that would affect other submissions.
