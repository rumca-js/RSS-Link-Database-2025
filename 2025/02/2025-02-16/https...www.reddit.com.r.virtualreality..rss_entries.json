The idea of writing and solving math problems in mid-air with my fingers sounds great. However, I&#39;m curious about its practicality. For example, can I open PDF files, browser to view tasks and solutions while writing in the air, or use the front cameras to display on headset what front facing cameras see and then write questions in vr, or see explanations to tasks with outside cameras which are written on paper or monitor. I never got headset so just to let you guys know I have no idea what I am getting myself into.

With this I decided it\u2019s probably best not to play vr today, but I don\u2019t know when I should start getting concerned about it, cause it\u2019s been maybe 16 hours since I took it off and the feeling is still here. Sorry for the long post, I just haven\u2019t been able to find much information on it. Been looking throughout the day trying to figure this out.
