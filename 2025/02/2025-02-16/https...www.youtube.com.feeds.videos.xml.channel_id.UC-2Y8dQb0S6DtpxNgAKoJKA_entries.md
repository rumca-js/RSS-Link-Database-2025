Kapih is a classic action platformer with local co-op play, engaging and fun levels, legendary boss battles and more.

Set in a colorfully imagined ancient India, you play as a brave Vaanar (monkey) as the main protagonist.

Kapih takes place at the backdrop of events of the Ramayana, one of the greatest epics of South East Asia. It immerses you into the story of how an otherwise ordinary life is suddenly rattled up by extraordinary events which in turn shape its destiny.

With vibrant, culturally rich art, an immersive story, and easy-to-learn mechanics, Kapih brings nostalgic gameplay to life. Join Vaanar and his friend Bindu in local co-op as they embark on a thrilling adventure and discover new motivations in their journey.
