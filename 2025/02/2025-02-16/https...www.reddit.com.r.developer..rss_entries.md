<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I am a junior web developer working on MERN stack. So basically I dont know what to do with my free time on weekend or after work. I dont want usually code after work since i come back around 9 at night and on weekend i desperately look to fill my time with something to avoid boredom. I am tearing my self between learning new things or do something else like starting a hobby. But on both ends have their own pros and cons. If i want to advance i have to give up something. If i spend time learning which is really essential i can better promote my self in work but then again i will be doing nothing but coding day and night and i dont want burn myself out and start hating it. On the other hand if i start a hobby i lose time to learn and grow professionally or even academic advancement. </p> <p>I know this question might make little to no sense and it really matters scenario to scenario. I just want to know if someone went through this.</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am developing an app that requires a upi intent flow. Lets assume this as a project funding application. The basic idea can be summarised as: user A, the founder of the project is registered in my app and I have stored the upi id while signing up. User A submits their project idea, and user B, who is interested in the project can send a donation to user A to fund the project. (Bad example but does the job of explaining my intention). I need to redirect user B upon clicking the button to upi apps with the pre-defined amount selected from my app. Yes, I could use payment gateways, but I need a very simplified free version of this.</p> <p>I looked up online for UPI intent flows but the deep linking does not work for non-merchant accounts. Are there any workarounds for this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nervous_Trick_9995"> /u/Nervous_Trick_9995 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
