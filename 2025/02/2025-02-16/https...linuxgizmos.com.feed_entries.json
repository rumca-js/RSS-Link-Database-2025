        "description": "OpenMV has introduced the Prophesee GenX320 camera module, bringing event-based vision sensing to its embedded platform. Unlike traditional image sensors that capture entire frames at fixed intervals, the GenX320 detects only changes in a scene, reducing data rates while improving efficiency in motion detection. The sensor operates asynchronously, with each pixel responding independently to illumination [&#8230;]",
