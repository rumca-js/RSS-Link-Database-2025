This one is entitled Escaping Utopia, a three-part documentary series on Gloriavale, a secretive sect founded in 1969 by preacher Neville Cooper, after he was vouchsafed at the age of 22 a vision of heaven on Earth by God. This vision involved establishing an isolated community in a remote part of New Zealand that would be run along wholly egalitarian lines, and men would live in absolute parity to women to secure their place in feminist heaven.</p><p>I jest, of course. Gloriavale ran – and, in reduced form, still runs – on the principles of women’s absolute subservience to men, men’s absolute subservience to the leaders above them (the dozen or so “shepherds”), and the shepherds’ absolute allegia

<p><strong>Finborough theatre, London</strong><br>A symbolic, stripped-down staging fails to plumb the chilling emotional depths of this story about a Jewish man trying to flee Germany in the 1930s</p><p>A wealthy Jewish businessman takes a series of Kafkaesque journeys on the German train system soon after Kristallnacht, driven from his home and in flight for his life. Otto Silbermann never makes it out of the country but – maddeningly – loops round and round, stuck in the trap of rising Nazi terror and afraid of every passenger he meets. He carries a suitcase of money, the last vestige of power he has in a homeland that has turned against Jews.</p><p>The Passenger is based on Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz’s novel, which was written at blazing speed when Boschwitz, himself a German Jew, was just 23. His manuscript was discovered decades after his death in 1942, at the age of 27.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/feb/16/the-passenger-review-finborough-theatre-london">C

<p>For Ange Postecoglou, the wait is finally over. On the same day that some Tottenham supporters voiced their displeasure at the chairman Daniel Levy before and after their first league win here since the start of November, Manchester United suffered their 12th defeat of the season courtesy of James Maddison’s first-half goal.</p><p>Rarely can a match between two sides who started the day in 14th and 15th positions in the Premier League table have garnered so much attention. But while Postecoglou was at last able to call on some experience off the bench to see out this vital victory, that will at least lift some of the pressure on his shoulders for a few days as his side moved up to the heady heights of 12th, by contrast United had to rely on the ageing Casemiro and a bench full of teenagers in an encounter that reflected the struggles of both sides this season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/16/tottenham-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report">Con

<p>Cotillard plays a movie actor starring in a production of The Snow Queen in Lucile Hadzihalilovic’s unwholesome story of yearning</p><p>An eerie and unwholesome spell is cast in this film; it is a fairytale of death-wish yearning and erotic submission. It wittily fuses the real and the fictional into a trance-state – and that’s the state that I’ve sometimes found a little static in previous films by Lucile Hadzihalilovic, but not here. Dreamily strange it might be (and in fact, on the face of it, entirely preposterous) this movie had me gripped with its two outstanding lead performances – from Marion Cotillard and newcomer Clara Pacini – and a clamorous musical score.</p><p>Cotillard plays a diva-ish movie actress called Cristina, who is the lead in a new adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen being filmed on a soundstage which is in a remote and snowy spot in late 60s France; she is gorgeously costumed in a sparkling white form-fitting gown and crown, a look she c

Undocumented Palestinian refugees living hand to mouth in Athens, they subsist on what they can scrape from petty crimes.

Clean for a month, his addiction continues to get in the way of his view of the future. Clinging to his smarter, stronger cousin, Reda asks again to hear about the cafe, like a kid pleading for a bedtime story. When a scheme to make money backfires, Chatila snatches opportunity from the jaws of disappointment and comes up with a plan to earn enough to escape Athens.

It centres on the NHS, our strained systems of social care and an ever-more toxic and hateful conversation about immigration. Without hundreds of thousands of people who have come to the UK from abroad, the most basic aspects of how we look after old, infirm and ill people would simply collapse. Politics, however, increasingly seems to demand that this truth has to be denied – and the result is a level of hypocrisy that is remarkable even by modern standards.</p><p>Three weeks before last Christmas, my dad – who turns 89 next month – fell down a flight of stairs, and broke his hip.

<p>The British art historian’s essays demonstrate a wide erudition but suffer from his relentless scrutinising      </p><p>Politics runs through the history of art like a protester in a museum with a tin of soup. From emperors’ heads on coins to Picasso’s anti-war masterpiece, <em>Guernica</em>, and Banksy’s street art, power and visual culture have been closely and sometimes combustibly associated. This relationship is explored in essays by the distinguished art historian TJ Clark, professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. Many of them first appeared in the <em>London Review of Books</em>, where the academic is given room to dilate in its rather airless pages. He brings a wide scholarship and unflagging scrutiny to his task. That said, his introduction includes the discouraging spoiler: “art-and-politics [is] hell to do”. From time to time, the reader finds themselves recalling this damning admission.</p><p>Clark writes from a “political position on the left”. He

A curtain of water dramatically falls from the sky, shimmering in the light, plumes of the stuff arcing into the air and crashing against the giant, monolithic rock that dominates the stage (designer Peter Pabst is almost as much an author of this work as Bausch). Water is a recurring theme in Bausch’s work and here it rains down, spurts from mouths, is thrown from buckets and poured into overflowing glasses, impossible to catch or control.</p><p>Bausch’s other great recurring theme is the endless cycle of flawed human habits (Vollmond means “full moon”, more cycles) and the power play and pettine

<p><strong>Riverside Studios, London</strong><br>Adapted from a French bestseller, this fictional story of Martin, who missed out on the role of a lifetime, becomes a meditation on how lives are changed</p><p>Martin has a meltdown during his pregnant partner’s 12-week scan. For reasons he can’t divine, the prospect of fatherhood is dredging up his childhood demons, specifically the lingering humiliation of being passed over for the film role of Harry Potter when he was 10. These flashbacks trigger a reappraisal of a life lived in the shadow of the Potter franchise that has dogged Martin like an inescapable flock of Dementors.</p><p>If this sounds like a slender premise, don’t be fooled. Adapted by Barney Norris from David Foenkinos’s bestselling 2022 French novel, directed by Michael Longhurst, <em>Second Best</em> is a deceptively unassuming play. What starts out like a comical but mundane monologue soon becomes an elegant meditation on the misshapen nature of trauma.</p> <a href="h

<p>By voting in favor of nominees they knew should never be approved, Republican senators became Trump’s subjects</p><p>First, before Elon Musk came for everyone, Donald Trump came for the US Senate. When he returned to office, the House of Representatives was already under his heel. Many of the House Republican leaders had been his sidekicks during January 6, and one, Mark Johnson, had since become the speaker. The Senate, however, still retained, for the most part, its club-like atmosphere where the members considered themselves powers unto themselves. Senators with a toga complex have always looked down on House members as rabble. Trump viewed the independent character of the upper body as a thorn in his side. The subservience of the House of Representatives was the model that Trump envisioned for the Senate. It could no longer pretend to be the greatest deliberative body of legislators in the world, but a vassal fiefdom subject to his whims.</p><p>Trump’s opportunity to crush the

<p>The fresh flavours of rhubarb and zesty blood orange light up dark February days</p><p>As children, we would always play in each other’s gardens. At the bottom of which, somewhere between the compost heap and the wheelbarrow, would be a patch of rhubarb; scarlet stalks hidden under vast emerald leaves and, occasionally, when everyone had enough crumble, left to sprout plumes of creamy white flowers. In winter, the crowns would sleep under upturned buckets whose bottoms had rusted to a lacework of tiny holes and would no longer hold water.</p><p>My current garden refuses to give a home to rhubarb, just as it does to wild garlic, and I am resigned to buying my stalks at the greengrocers. I crave the cosy glow of rhubarb on a grey winter’s day, be it under a crust, stirred into a cake or sitting in a pool of its own jewel-bright juice for breakfast. Rhubarb also makes an entrancing granita, served in a pile of glistening pink crystals with a spoonful of vanilla-infused cream as a con

<p>We can’t tell him not to shout ‘Jesus Christ!’ just because it’s rude</p><p>Our son is defending himself against the crime of blasphemy. A magnet had fallen off the fridge and met the floor with a startling crack, causing him to shout, ‘Jesus Christ!’</p><p>‘Language!’ we say, with disapproving voices. If I’m honest, mine is actually my dad’s voice. I can’t help it. I’ve never really developed a disciplinary mode of my own, so any time I need to admonish my children it’s him that comes out, unbidden and full-throated, with a tinge of his Fermanagh brogue to make its source even more mortifyingly obvious. My wife, too, has a similar affliction, inflecting her most authoritatively maternal barbs with hints of her mum’s native Carlow.

<p>A history of the campaigners who in the 1970s were viewed as cranks for demanding pay for domestic work is unintentionally comic at times but, 50 years on, their ideas no longer seem so radical</p><p>In the 1970s, the campaigning group Wages for Housework – women, lay down your dusters! – was thought to be cranky and cultish even by some of the second-wave feminists who should then have been most sympathetic to its cause. The story went that if someone stood up at a meeting and announced themselves as one of its members, the audience would groan, knowing a lecture was inevitable; in 1975, the <em>Guardian</em> compared its acolytes (it never had more than a few dozen official members) to Jehovah’s Witnesses. By the time it finally fizzled out in the 1990s, its reputation was in the mud. Increasingly riven by factions, former members accused its leadership of bullying and intimidation.</p><p>But some ideas take a long time to come into their own. In Britain in 2025, the issue of so

<p>The comedian talks about politics, podcasts, family life’s ups and downs and surviving throat cancer. Plus, a remarkable extract from his new memoir</p><p>To understand the mindset of a comedian, Mark Steel says, you should imagine you’re on a plane that’s going down. While most people are screaming, hugging loved ones, saying their final prayers, the comic is sitting quietly, mind whirring, thinking, “I wonder what the joke in this is? It would be even worse if it was a plane full of comics,” Steel says when we meet at his home in south London. “Everyone would be trying to come up with the darkest, funniest thing to say before they hit the earth.”</p><p>This certainly explains his new book: <em>The Leopard In My House: One Man’s Adventures in Cancerland</em>. Back in 2023, the 64-year-old was diagnosed with throat cancer – the “leopard” in the book’s title – and he’s spent the past year recovering from debilitating chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment. His gruelling account ha

<p>Perhaps the problem might not be the world itself, but the way you see it</p><p><em><strong>The question </strong>I am writing to you from the edge of the abyss… Hello! Despite the privileges I’ve had, my life has been a constant struggle. Since I was four, I’ve had little joie de vivre, thanks to a stew of mental</em><em> health issues, a difficult home life and a recent discovery that I’m on the autistic spectrum. I don’t blame my autism for everything</em><em> – my personality would be difficult regardless</em><em> – but it explains a lot.</em></p><p><em>My life runs in cycles: denial of my feelings, stoicism, breaking point, sabotage and starting over. As a child, I’d bottle up frustrations at school, only to explode at home. In adulthood, these meltdowns have been more dramatic: quitting jobs, a half-baked suicide attempt, tantrums and, my biggest regret, the Pixie Cut Year. I’ve navigated life like the Charge of the Light Brigade, with little to show for it. I’ve had a strin

<p>The high priestess of punk’s new look was described as Betty Boop crossed with pantomime dame</p><p>Fashion in the 1990s is all about revivals and this season, it is the turn of the bottom to go back in time. In her autumn collection, On Liberty, Vivienne Westwood has brought back the bustle in the form of a padded cushion kept in place by a fabric tie, writes Lucinda Alford in the <em>Observer Magazine</em> on 18 September 1994, ‘or attached to a roll-on panty’. The cushion bustle is worn under clingy knitted dresses, or peeping out from the back of strategically cut skirts. The look is Betty Boop crossed with a pantomime dame, inspired by the 19th-century bustle. Hyper-femininity is the watchword.</p><p>Continuing her worship of women through fashion, the high priestess of punk says her new silhouette ‘idealises women and their feminine shape. It does not make you look fat; by emphasising the waist it can make you look slim.’ Westwood decries women’s current soft spot for comfor

<p>Chardonnay from the Aussies, sauvingnon from the Kiwis?

But there are plenty of winemakers on either side of the Tasman Sea who make fantastic wines from the neighbouring country’s specialities – a fact that was confirmed at a tasting in London recently in which 10 examples of each of those big four varieties, five from New Zealand and five Australian, were lined up for

<p>A nurse has a right to dignity and privacy when getting changed</p><p>As a feminist for over 50 years, I was delighted to see Sonia Sodha defending the right of a female nurse to dignity and privacy when changing within an NHS hospital.

We have established protected female-only spaces not because all men pose a risk, but because some, indeed many, do. As it is not possible to know which men pose that risk, we exclude them all. The reality is that a man remains a man, irrespective of his gender identity, and should not therefore be allowed access to places that for very good reasons are designated for women only. It seems extraordinary at a time when violence against wom

To stand in the screaming crowds (possibly the loudest I have ever heard) at Perth’s RAC Arena, on the first stop on what will be her biggest world tour in two decades, is a reminder of what a genius of reinvention she is. This is a show stuffed with preposterously catchy hit after preposterously catchy hit – “from, you name it, almost any decade,” Minogue herself says, before letting out that endearingly goofy laugh.</p><p>Two decades ago, she said she would never be the queen of pop, as that title went to Madonna – “I’m the princess.
