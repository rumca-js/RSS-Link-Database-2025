<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Areas of Strength: Your creative adaptation of Gulliver&#39;s Travels into a musical landscape shows originality, particularly in how you&#39;ve transformed social divisions into musical genres. The humorous characterization of each group demonstrates a good grasp of satirical elements that would appeal to modern readers. Your observation that &quot;most of the other genres are at least 15% popper&quot; cleverly suggests the interconnectedness of musical styles, despite their apparent divisions.</p> <p>Areas for Growth: Consider developing the satirical commentary further. How might these musical divisions reflect real-world social or cultural conflicts? Swift used his story to critique specific societal issues. The introduction sets up an interesting premise, but the story ends abruptly just as Gulliver is about to begin his exploration.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve tried using Face ID since it came out until a few months ago, but disabled it simply because it was bad at accurately recognizing my face. I’ve had it on two different iPhones (an XR and a 13), reset it multiple times, even made additional profiles for when I wear glasses or a mask, and no cigar. I’d ballpark it worked around 40% of the time, and when it did, I had to put my face right in clear view of the front camera in good lighting and deadpan with a completely neutral expression. Most of the time, I would wait for Face ID to fail enough times so it’d ask for my passcode instead, which is why I eventually turned it off. My Photos library also thinks I’m multiple people, although as time goes by it believes I’m fewer people (currently three versus 6 when that feature came out). Does anyone with knowledge of how this technology works know why this might be the case? I don’t really care to use Face ID anymore, but I’m curious as to why this may

He explains the risks and the shortcomings of, what he calls; the worst AI you&#39;ll ever use (since the better AI is coming!). But he also zooms in on the possibilities that Generative AI will give us as humans.<br/> In the end of the book Mollick gives a foresight of what AI may become in the near future.</p> <p>Mollick explains how generative AI works, that the results are dependant on the data it has been trained with. Most Gen AI tools are trained with public data that can be found on the internet.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The researchers developed a new evaluation framework called GSM-Ranges to systematically assess mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs across different numerical ranges. This extends beyond typical benchmarks by testing both logical consistency and computational accuracy across numbers from very small (10<sup>-10)</sup> to very large (10<sup>10)</sup> magnitudes.</p> <p>Key technical aspects: • Created variations of Grade School Math (GSM) problems by substituting different numerical ranges • Evaluated both step-by-step reasoning and final answer accuracy • Tested models&#39; ability to maintain consistent solution approaches regardless of number size • Analyzed performance patterns across different mathematical operations • Measured impact of number magnitude on calculation precision</p> <p>Main results: • Performance degrades significantly outside &quot;common&quot; number ranges (10<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>4)</sup> • Models show inconsistent r

## Is ChatGPT's "Smarter" Behavior Just Advanced Personalization? A Hypothesis

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There’s been a growing conversation lately about how ChatGPT4o seems significantly <em>smarter</em>, more <em>personable</em>, and even <em>more insightful</em> than other AI models. Some users report that it feels fundamentally different, as if it has undergone a major intelligence upgrade.</p> <p>But I have a different hypothesis:<br/> <strong>ChatGPT isn’t actually “smarter” in the traditional sense—it just personalizes responses so well that it</strong> <strong><em>feels</em></strong> <strong>like a fundamentally more advanced model.</strong> </p> <h1>The Echo Chamber Effect</h1> <p>Unlike other models that treat each conversation as isolated, ChatGPT remembers past interactions (at least in its ongoing chat memory). This means that:</p> <p>It builds a long-term <em>model of you</em>—your interests, writing style, and reasoning patterns.</p> <p>It adapts its responses to feel increasingly in sync with your worldview.</p> <p>Conversations feel <st
