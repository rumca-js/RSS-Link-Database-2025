<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, before this year, I have probably only read a handful of books in my entire life, however, I made it a goal of mine this year to read 12 books (1 each month) as to try and become more educated. I am mostly interested in reading books which are historically accredited and centered around philosophy and success however I don’t know which ones would be best. So far I’ve read Mediations by Marcus Aurelius and am currently working on The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel. I also ordered The Art of War by Sun Tzu as-well as the The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene to read next. I’m looking for suggestions as I’m not totally sure what other books are worth the time/ money. I have heard The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is a worthwhile read however I would greatly appreciate more suggestions. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/__Anon999__"> /u/__Anon999__ </a> <br/> <span><a h

I am not exactly rigid about spice. I mean, it&#39;s okay as long as its relevant to the book. But please don&#39;t recommend those booktok books like Twisted, Shatter Me series, Ice breaker, To Love Jason Whatever and yhat stuff. Its as if the spice was thought of first and then the book was written. I just read all three Khaled Hosseini books and I NEED something cheerful and fun. Cutesy romances, holding hands and stuff, something like kdramas. I like all that. I&#39;m also okay with tragedies tbh. Just a GOOD romance. ROMANCE.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I recently got my partner to read my all time favorite book and he asked me for similar books. The only one I could personally think of was “The Schwa Was Here” by Neal Shusterman (he also loves this one). What I love about the book is the conversation on loss, grief, mental health, poverty, racism, and coming of age. I love the humor aspect and the art (but this isn’t a must for book suggestions!) I also really liked it because I grew up in a very similar life, one he had never really grasped. </p> <p>He likes it because of the easy exposure to the same tough topics, it being about a place and people he had never really been around (from the east coast, heavy Italian heritage), and audio books with authors who read them and have heavy regional accents. He also really loves the Schwa as he heavily relates. </p> <p>Another I have thought of was Star Girl or Flipped, books I think we both could relate to. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->
