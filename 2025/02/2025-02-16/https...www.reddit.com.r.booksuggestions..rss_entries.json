Even ones where he&#39;s brooding and misunderstood. I just really wanna read one where he&#39;s bratty and obsessive, but has nothing to back it up, he&#39;s not rich or powerful he&#39;s just a guy. Even better if he&#39;s got attachment issues, and is scared to love me because he doesn&#39;t believe anyone would actually love him. He wants everyone to think he&#39;s super unattached and cool, but he&#39;s actually super lonely and a bit of a brat. Even better if he&#39;s really jealous, but not possessive. Like, he&#39;s not gonna lock mc in his basement but oh man does he want to through every man that smiles at her in front of a train. The sorts of character I have to compare would be something like Crowley from good Omens. He&#39;s a bit on the jealous side, but not possessive I think, ",

I am mostly interested in reading books which are historically accredited and centered around philosophy and success however I don\u2019t know which ones would be best. So far I\u2019ve read Mediations by Marcus Aurelius and am currently working on The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel. I also ordered The Art of War by Sun Tzu as-well as the The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene to read next. I\u2019m looking for suggestions as I\u2019m not totally sure what other books are worth the time/ money. I have heard The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is a worthwhile read however I would greatly appreciate more suggestions.

I\u2019m not a fan of really descriptive books where there is page(s) constantly of setting description. I have a preference to read books where the immediate series is finished, or final book is to be released in next few months My favourite fantasy series I\u2019ve read in my life are: all Abercrombie books, asoiaf, chronicles of the unhewn throne, the dagger and the coin, and war for the rose throne. So something that resembles some/all of these series would be perfect.

The only one I could personally think of was \u201cThe Schwa Was Here\u201d by Neal Shusterman (he also loves this one). What I love about the book is the conversation on loss, grief, mental health, poverty, racism, and coming of age. I love the humor aspect and the art (but this isn\u2019t a must for book suggestions!) I also really liked it because I grew up in a very similar life, one he had never really grasped. </p> <p>He likes it because of the easy exposure to the same tough topics, it being about a place and people he had never really been around (from the east coast, heavy Italian heritage), and audio books with authors who read them and have heavy regional accents. He also really loves the Schwa as he heavily relates. </p> <p>Another I have thought of was Star Girl or Flipped, books I think we both could relate to. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",
