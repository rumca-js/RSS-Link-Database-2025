The OpenWrt One/AP-24.XY is a router board based on the MediaTek MT7981B (Filogic 820) SoC, combined with the MediaTek MT7976C dual-band Wi-Fi 6 chipset. Developed in collaboration with Banana Pi, the OpenWrt One is the first official hardware platform supported by the OpenWrt open-source community, designed for OpenWrt learning, IoT applications, and general networking use [&#8230;]

OpenMV has introduced the Prophesee GenX320 camera module, bringing event-based vision sensing to its embedded platform. Unlike traditional image sensors that capture entire frames at fixed intervals, the GenX320 detects only changes in a scene, reducing data rates while improving efficiency in motion detection. The sensor operates asynchronously, with each pixel responding independently to illumination [&#8230;]
