<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Elastic Security Labs discovered that new malware called FinalDraft</strong> is exploiting Microsoft Outlook drafts for hidden communication in a cyber-espionage campaign. By blending into Microsoft 365 traffic, attackers avoid detection while targeting a South American ministry.</p> <p>The attack begins with PathLoader, which installs the FinalDraft backdoor. Instead of sending actual emails, the backdoor uses Outlook drafts to communicate with the attacker‚Äôs infrastructure, hiding commands and responses in draft emails (r_&lt;session-id&gt;, p_&lt;session-id&gt;). After execution, drafts are deleted, making it difficult to trace.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I just released a major update to my GitHub project on hiding shellcode in image files.<br/> Previously, the code relied on WinAPIs to fetch the payload from the resource sections. In this new update, I‚Äôve implemented custom functions to manually parse the PEB/PE headers, completely bypassing the need for WinAPIs. üéâ</p> <p>This makes the code significantly stealthier, taking evasion to a whole new level. üî•</p> <p>Check it out here:<br/> üîó GitHub Repository:<br/> üëâ <a href="https://github.com/WafflesExploits/hide-payload-in-images">https://github.com/WafflesExploits/hide-payload-in-images</a><br/> üîó Full Guide Explaining the Code:<br/> üëâ <a href="https://wafflesexploits.github.io/posts/Hide_a_Payload_in_Plain_Sight_Embedding_Shellcode_in_a_Image_file/">https://wafflesexploits.github.io/posts/Hide_a_Payload_in_Plain_Sight_Embedding_Shellcode_in_a_Image_file/</a><br/> üìö Updated Table of Contents:<br/> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hide a Payload in an Image File by
