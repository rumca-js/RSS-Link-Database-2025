I loved that movie and after it I became a big Transformers fan, watching whatever movies and clips I could find online at that age. It even spilled into my other hobbies like gaming and music; I started listening to Linkin Park (still do) and played whatever games had transformers in them. I remember playing Fall of Cybertron a lot on my Xbox 360. Got as many Transformer toys and figures I could get. Just saying I was a fan would be an understatement.</p> <p>As I got a couple of years older I started watching the other movies as they released.

I think parts like the months going by could be parts where you do stuff around the outpost like maintenance and maybe even tending to the garden just to add in some content. I feel there are elements that could really work well in a game like the shooting at the outposts or attacking/defending yourself when you&#39;re down at the bottom of the gorge.

Thought it was a very tense thriller and it\u2019s a true story. For those of us who grew up in the era watching The Dating Game, it was just so unreal. Cheryl was just so lucky to get away from him. And omg that poor girl who finally got him arrested was so brave. They say he could have killed as many as 130 women and girls but was only charged for 12 killings. Of course no DNA then but still the police were so dismissive of the women who reported him. So aggravating! Anyway wondered what anyone else who watched it thought. Anna Kendrick did a great job directing and starring. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Starksista\"> /u/Starksista </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iqwqyb/woman_of_the_hour/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iq",

From what I&#39;ve read, the Brutalist was shown at a 1.66:1 ratio.

He plays as a security guard who works for a security company and had an armored vehicle being robbed during a hiest. One of the robbers went and shot his son, so he went and seek revenge. The movie felt like it dragged a little long, because of the acts that were flashbacks that were already shown from the beginning of the film, but I guess its there to simply remind the audience about what happened and how the story went down. It even had an interesting twist on it, too, at the near ending, where Bullet was revealed to be the inside man and turned on his own teammates.
