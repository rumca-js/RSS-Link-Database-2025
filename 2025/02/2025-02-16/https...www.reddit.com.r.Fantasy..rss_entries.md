<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I loved The Saint of Bright Doors by Vajra Chandrasekera. I started late on a Friday night (early Saturday morning, really), after finishing another book. &quot;I&#39;ll read the first few pages on my next book, get tired, go to bed&quot; I thought. I kept reading for the next 3 hours.</p> <p>The Saint of Bright Doors amazed me in so many ways. It&#39;s incredibly well written, and it subverts expectations fabulously. It&#39;s queer, South Asian, definitively fantasy while having all modern technology, it subverts Chose One tropes down to the atom. Some parts are harrowing to read after the pandemic.</p> <p>The premise of The Saint of Bright doors is that Fetter, the son of a Saint (a de facto god), the Perfect and Kind, is raised by his mother to kill his father. Instead, Fetter flees his destiny, and settles down in the city of Luriat, and needs to now live with the trauma of his upbringing and his newfound directionlessness. </p> <p>I really liked

## What words do magical fantasy worlds use to describe powerful abilities or phenomena that do not exist?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In &quot;fantasy&quot; worlds where &quot;magic&quot; is commonplace, amenable to systematic study, and at least partially understood, all the words that we use for magical fantasy stuff IRL are still used to describe fully mundane things in the fictional world.</p> <p>But the human appetite for wonder and superstition seems no more likely to be sated by “wizards” casting “spells” after decades of dedicated study than it is to engineers, scientists, doctors, etc. performing seemingly wondrous and often poorly understood feats today.</p> <p>In fantasy settings, books about plucky young wizards attending magic school and learning to cast spells would just be filed under “literary realism”. But there are probably also works of fiction that focus on mere “wizards” performing works unattainable by any “magical” means. Set in worlds where rhinos and whales roam, and not the boring old unicorns and dragons you can find in <em>any</em> random farm or zoo. Si

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yo,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been getting into reading this last year and am looking for more book suggestions. I am extremely picky when it comes to most media and found that I have really been enjoying LitRPG books. I really like the concept of following 1 person get stronger and stronger, awesome fights and constantly unlocking new and interesting abilities. However, I feel like you could get this similar concept without the game like pieces. I do like the game mechanics but I don&#39;t necessarily need game mechanics like levelling up and all that jazz. </p> <p>I really love solo character books, like the start of <em>Defiance of the Fall</em> or the solo levelling in <em>Primal Hunter</em>, with those cool wow moments when others see their power. What usually throws me off, though, is when these books start getting too big. They zoom out too far and start showing multiple planets, universes, and a never-ending cast of characters that I just can&#39;t fol

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys!! I’m desperately looking for a book (or a series of book) that has good romance in it without being based on a erotic worldbuilding. I’ve been searching around and, for some reasons, a lot of the recs I had features characters or plot that evolves around any kind of sexuality, for some reason. For example: Kushiel’s Dart or Daughter of the Blood. I’m not against sex scenes or anything (as long as it’s well done) but I’m always through Daughter of the Blood and EVERYTHING is the book is sort of sex-related, which is interested at first, but only at first. And I think Kushiel’s Dart is also very erotic, which is not what I’m looking for, though I really enjoy the dark themes that come with it sometimes. Anyway! I’m more interested in fantasy like Gentlemen Bastards, The Witcher or The Poppy War, yk. If it’s dark the better, but I’m a sucker for funny, witty, sarcastic and unhinged characters. </p> <p>So, to put it shortly: epic fantasy that is

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I know that there are a lot of urban fantasy stories about werebeasts like Mercy Thompson and Grimm. But are there any Fantasy worlds that feature Werebeasts? So far, the only ones I&#39;m familiar with are the Continent from the Witcher, Thedas from Dragon Age, and Lyssia from Wereworld.</p> <p>Preferably Fantasy Worlds that feature werebeasts with the following characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>In addition to heightened senses, some werebeasts like Walkers have the ability to communicate with ghosts and control them.</li> <li>Werebeasts are vulnerable to silver weapons.</li> <li>Since I&#39;m not a big fan of how the Mercy Thompson series uses the Painful transformation trope to reduce women as second-class citizens, I would prefer works of fantasy where all werebeasts are able to avert this. As a result werebeasts are able to have children with each other and humans. That said it&#39;s still possible to turn other humans by biting them.</li> </ol>

For background, I haven’t completed a book in 2 years, and haven’t found a fantasy or sci-fi book that clicked with me since I started “A Game of Thrones” 6 years ago. One of my goals for 2025 is to complete 10 books. I play a lot of dnd and enjoy fantasy elements in general which is why I’m really wanting to find a fantasy or sci-fi book that really clicks with me. The problem is: I haven’t yet. </p> <p>Q3 of last year, I began this journey by picking up “Theft of Swords” by Michael J. Sullivan. I dropped it because although I liked the pace and the dynamic between the characters, it felt very generic and I felt like there were better books out there I could be reading (here’s hoping this thread proves me right).</p> <p>I put reading aside as I got busy with my education, until early January where I picked up “Name of the Wind” fr

Not anything as classic and old as Lord of the rings though, or anything George R.R Martin.</p> <p>What I’m looking to read is something captivating, to make me not want to put the book down, good world building, maybe something like Suicide Squad but make it good fantasy. I like thrilling books, good plot, I like romance too, can be a subplot though I don’t mind. </p> <p>I don’t necessarily like ‘ good guy ‘ main character, or ‘ good guys win ‘ trope. I enjoy versatile characters, very morally grey, very twisted sense of justice, don’t like all ultimatum thinking: you either right, or wrong. Nah.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations, thank you and I appreciate it😭, sorry if it sounded very nitpicky like but I’m tired of DNF ing books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/use

As many of us know, <a href="/r/fantasy">r/fantasy</a> has come storming out defending Naomi King without having heard the story from both parts. And there have been some people on Reddit trying to emphasize that, especially on <a href="/r/fantasy">r/fantasy</a>. So, the last couple of days, people on Reddit claimed that they&#39;d gotten banned on <a href="/r/fantasy">r/fantasy</a> for that reason. Because that is just not okay if you think about all the people that have defended Naomi on here, which haven&#39;t been touched. Anyways, the alleged bans happened on the 14th and 15th of February. So, with the new Naomi King video out, where Naomi proves that Daniel might not be as guilty as some might have thought, I&#39;m thinking about those now-famous texts in our community that I would guess ruin Naomi&#39;s legal chances. So, I hope <a href="/r/fantasy">r/fantasy</a> has some kind of apology ready for

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My friend seems to think that Warcraft has the largest bestiary, which I doubt, based on lts youth, for one thing. I&#39;m guessing the winner is some long-running literary franchise, like Oz, the Tolkien Legendarium, Choose Your Own Adventure or Dungeons &amp; Dragons (not exactly literary). Other possibilities: Mario, Zork, Ultima, Well World, the World Of Darkness, In The Realms Of The Unreal, the Buffyverse. I&#39;m just listing franchises to get the neurons firing. Technically, mega-crossover franchises like M.U.G.E.N., Robot Chicken, YouTube Poop &amp; Undocumented Features have the most, but that&#39;s kind-of a copout.</p> <p>To be clear, I am asking which franchise contains the most fantasy species. Is Warcraft a serious contender? I admit that I know very little about Warcraft.
