Coincidentally when i was having some work done in and around my home. I want to know what it is. Here are the knowns: I\u2019m a noob, i have no one to ask help from, i find this fun and intriguing but also scary, i like mysteries, i know the ip, mac, it says its wireless, and nmap says its os is Dell powerconnect 2708 switch? Unknowns: i dont know a lot cuz basic, ip and mac comes up nothing with basic web search. My router gives no info. Nmap says nothing else other than the OS. I cant find any manufacturer info. Other info: If i kick it off line and back on. It seems to change its ip and mac? Conclusion: I\u2019m limited by my knowledge but not my determination. Im asking for legit knowledge/detectors/software/technics. I will do the work. I could change my password but it will most likely come back. I could just kick it off line but it might change its ip and mac and come back. Also,",
