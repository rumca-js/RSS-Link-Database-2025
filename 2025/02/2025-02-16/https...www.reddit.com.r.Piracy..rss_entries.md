<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all, this is a quick question regarding DNS and security. I use cloudflare&#39;s DNS server (1.1.1.1) to resolved my DNS. </p> <p>For the last few days, in my Prowlarr config, the know as $(1340 - 3)x dot to wasn&#39;t working. I tried opening it directly, and that didn&#39;t work either, I was getting a Cloudflare TLS verification failed error. It said that the website had to fix their SSL ceritificate. It was working fine in my phone, that uses another DNS provider. </p> <p>So I changed my DNS provider to google (8.8.8.8), and that resvoled the issue. So it seems that cloudflare was blocking me from accessing it. But I have also used cloudflare extensively before, and I kind of trust it to not do such stuff. I also know google&#39;s DNS must be using a similar level of security. So does anyone know why the aforementioned site does not work with Cloudflare&#39;s DNS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit
