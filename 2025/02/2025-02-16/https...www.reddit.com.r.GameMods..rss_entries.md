<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have no idea how to make them work for the game. I have mod engine 2 downloaded and I can get that to open the game just fine but whenever I try to install mods they donâ€™t get added to the game from any app I try to launch. For context I want to download a randomizer mod and a ps5 controller input mod if that matters. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CompleteTomorrow9803"> /u/CompleteTomorrow9803 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1iqkhxq/need_help_downloading_steamrip_elden_ring_mods/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1iqkhxq/need_help_downloading_steamrip_elden_ring_mods/">[comments]</a></span>
