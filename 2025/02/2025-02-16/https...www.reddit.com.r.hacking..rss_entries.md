<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A 21st century coup is happening in America. It’s a textbook case, but they’re using technology to do it rather than the methods we’re used to seeing. In the past, resistance was fought with weapons. In a democracy, resistance is fought with protesting and advocating our representatives. In a tech oligarchy, resistance must be fought by hacking technology that is allowing this to occur, and that is allowing the billionaires to fuel their takeover. </p> <p>Does anyone agree?</p> <p>If you believe otherwise, you’re being fed propaganda and lies. Have a conversation with me about it rather than rejecting this point. </p> <p>This is no longer political. This is existential. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/diabeticdiva"> /u/diabeticdiva </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ir5cry/the_solution_to_a_21st_century_coup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I starded recently to do research on white label chinese products. And there are a bunch of issues with a lot of them, not only on the product themselves, but also on their supporting infrastructure. </p> <p>The weird part is that it is hard to track down who owns what, specially when a product can be a chinese knockoff of a real chinese product (think android boxes). I know that someone is since someone have to run the servers, but it feels impossible to know who</p> <p>Is there anything that can be done in this case? I want to publish mybresearch, but I want to do that in a responsible fashion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_supitto"> /u/_supitto </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iqszh8/how_to_do_responsible_disclosure_with_untrackable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iqszh8/how_to_do_responsible_disclosure_
