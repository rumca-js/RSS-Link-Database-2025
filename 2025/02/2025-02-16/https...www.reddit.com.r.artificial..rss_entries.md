<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I have been exploring Browser Use framework to automate web tasks such as fill out forms automatically, get info from the websites and so on.</p> <p>One of the use cases I found was automatically booking or finding flights and it worked nicely well.</p> <p>It was cool to find out an open-source alternative to OpenAI Operator, and free, since Gemini 2.0 Flash is currently free of charge, and it&#39;s possible to use Ollama.</p> <p>Do you have any ideas on other use cases for this framework?</p> <p>I wrote a Medium article on how to use Browser Use and Gemini 2.0 Flash for the use case of book a flight on Google Flights.
