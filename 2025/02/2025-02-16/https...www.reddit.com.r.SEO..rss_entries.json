I still need to create a website, looking into Wordpress for this. I was curious how difficult is it to learn and implement Google SEO in order to bring my page to the front of google search in my area? Thank you in advance for those who take the time to respond! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Front_Champion_6118\"> /u/Front_Champion_6118 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1iqfy36/is_it_possible_to_teach_yourself_seo/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1iqfy36/is_it_possible_to_teach_yourself_seo/\">[comments]</a></span>",
