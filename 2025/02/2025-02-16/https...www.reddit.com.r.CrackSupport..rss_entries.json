I am unable to launch RE8 at all.<br/> I do not get the game even to show the first signs of life, however I noticed when I add it through steam as 3rd party, that it launches and then crashes after a while.</p> <p>CPU: Ryzen 7 5700X, GPU: RTX 4060 - Maybe this would indicate to something.</p> <p>I suspect bios settings, also, if you think it could be due to it being from Empire, if you have any better links, dont mind sending it :D</p> <p>Any suggestion, help, would help out, as I will try solving it on my own as well!
