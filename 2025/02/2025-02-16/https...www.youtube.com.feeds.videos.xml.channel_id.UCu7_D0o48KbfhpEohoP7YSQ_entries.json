        "description": "Soil moisture sensors are essential for successful working with plants. In video #207, I showed some of the most common sensors. Some of them were bad, and some were ok. In the meantime, I discovered a new sensor type that promises accuracy and more data. These sensors are also waterproof and can be buried. So, let\u2019s check them out. We will also learn about the RS485 and Modbus interface and how to connect such sensors to MQTT and Home Assistant.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nRS485 to TTL adapters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oFVaPgu\n5V to 3.3V converters: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_onTc9Qy\nComWinTop soil sensors: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooZXRWM\nHalisense soil sensors: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooZXRWM\nNPK soil sensor: https://amzn.to/42TAl2Y or https://amzn.to/3D1hBnH\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost t",
