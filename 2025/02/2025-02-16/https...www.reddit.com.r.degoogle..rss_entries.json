I&#39;ve tried several apps, such as Image Toolbox (which is great for all the options it has), but haven&#39;t found something that seems to work well with just a few taps.

I read a little bit and watched some videos, but it&#39;s all just too complicated for me. I was wondering, is there any service that I can use or pay for to help me do all this? Or is there anybody that I can just pay to just do it all for me and set me up? Like get a new phone, laptop etc. And set up my emails? I feel like especially with what&#39;s going on politically lots of people are pissed off at Google and other big tech companies and want to just leave as much as possible and with how many people that wouldn&#39;t even know where to begin (like me) kinda sounds like a potential business market to capture.
