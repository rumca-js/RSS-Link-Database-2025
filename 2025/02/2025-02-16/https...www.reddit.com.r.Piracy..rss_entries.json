Filters? Pay every month. AI? Pay per use. I&#39;m sick of this thievery. My gf does video for fun on YouTube (no monetisation) and she would like to use some filters but she should pay every month for all the good filters. Is there any way to get this filters for free? Or there is a safe website to download some good filters? Already looked on the megathread and used the Search function but found nothing. Thanks to anyone who can help.

I use cloudflare&#39;s DNS server (1.1.1.1) to resolved my DNS. </p> <p>For the last few days, in my Prowlarr config, the know as $(1340 - 3)x dot to wasn&#39;t working. I tried opening it directly, and that didn&#39;t work either, I was getting a Cloudflare TLS verification failed error. It said that the website had to fix their SSL ceritificate. It was working fine in my phone, that uses another DNS provider. </p> <p>So I changed my DNS provider to google (8.8.8.8), and that resvoled the issue. So it seems that cloudflare was blocking me from accessing it. But I have also used cloudflare extensively before, and I kind of trust it to not do such stuff. I also know google&#39;s DNS must be using a similar level of security. So does anyone know why the aforementioned site does not work with Cloudflare&#39;s DNS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",
