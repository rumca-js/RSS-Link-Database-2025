Sometimes it\u2019s about how much they wear down over time; other times, it\u2019s the fact that older parts get set aside and forgotten, only to be left behind by time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, it may seem like PCIe 4.0 just arrived to supercharge NVMe SSD speeds, but that was in 2018! We\u2019ve already moved on to PCIe 5.0, with PCIe 6.0 devices still on their way and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2287853/pcie-7-0s-first-draft-could-arrive-in-2025-at-up-to-512gb-s.html\">PCIe 7.0 slated for 2025</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it\u2019s not uncommon to upgrade PC parts\u2014and when you do, you have to figure out what to do with those components you\u2019ve retired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an older SSD or HDD taking up space in storage and you don\u2019t know what to do with it, here are a few ways you can get more mileage out of it without throw",

They\u2019re compact, they\u2019re quite, and they outperform traditional hard drives by a mile \u2014 but they also tend to slow down over time (and eventually stop working altogether).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. There are several things you can do to keep your SSD going at tip-top performance. Keep reading to see if your SSD has slowed down and what you can do to speed it back up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407542/best-ssds.html\">The best SSDs we\u2019ve tested</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"check-if-your-ssd-is-slowing-down\">Check if your SSD is slowing down</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SSDs can underperform for a few reasons: the storage space on the drive is running out, incorrect Windows settings are interfering, or maybe your SS",
