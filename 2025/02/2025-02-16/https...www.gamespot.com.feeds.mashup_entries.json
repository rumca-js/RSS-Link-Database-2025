A new attacker operator named Rauora, who hails from New Zealand, will also join Rainbow Six Siege.</p><p>The teaser for the big upcoming Siege update describes it as the game's \"biggest transformation\" yet. This will include both graphical and audio improvements, as well as \"deepened tactical gameplay,\" although no specifics were shared. Additionally, Ubisoft said there will be \"new ways to play,\" but again didn't say if that would come in the form of new game modes or something else.</p><p>Rauora will be available to play at the start of the upcoming Year 10 Season 1 as part of the Operation Prep Phase battle pass, and will be unlockable with Renown or R6 credits after two weeks.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-sieges-biggest-transformation-yet-teased/1100-6529518",

        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Ristar is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, February 16, 2025. Below, we make the case that despite Sonic's breakout celebrity, Ristar really deserved to be the face of Sega.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's fair to say that Mario will likely always sit on the throne as the most iconic video game mascot of all time, but Sonic the Hedgehog certainly gave him a run for his money back in the '90s. The lovable 'tude and blistering speed of the Blue Blur made him a cultural figure par excellence in the days of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, and you can even argue that his signature velocity defined the idea of that Sega console in the average gamer's mind. That said, Genesis fanatics are well aware that Sonic isn't even the best platform star on his own console. That honor belongs to Ristar, who Sonic kneecapped like a coward 30 years ago so he could stay on the treadmill of producing endlessly mediocre spin-offs with no substance or new ideas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oka",
