        "description": "<p>Alan Siegel at The Ringer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ahead of \u2018SNL50,\u2019 we asked Amy Poehler, Seth Meyers, Bill Hader,\nand more to tell us which of their sketches they hold closest to\ntheir hearts. [...]</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no magic formula, but the most transcendent sketches\u2009\u2014\u2009the ones we reference and quote, even years later\u2009\u2014\u2009often share\ntwo traits. Just ask Seth Meyers, the show\u2019s head writer and\n\u201cWeekend Update\u201d anchor for a decade. \u201cA lot of great <em>SNL</em>\nsketches are both obvious and unexpected,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to\ncombine the two to make it rise above what, you know, could be a\n<em>very good</em> sketch.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fun read with some great video clips. Really looking forward to the SNL50 special tonight.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018The Best \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 Sketches, According to the People Who Made Them\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/16/snl-best-sketches\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
