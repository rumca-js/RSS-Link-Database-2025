I have my title (Beneath the Scarlet Sky) and I am looking for a soundtrack suggestion to put on while I read. </p> <p>When I read a Conan novel I listened to the Conan Soundtrack and it was perfect. No words, just beautiful powerful music. </p> <p>When I read Darth Plagueis I found a really good Sith playlist on Spotify again with no words, just music. </p> <p>Listened to Friday the 13th while reading Hide, which ended up being a perfect mix. </p> <p>Now I am starting a WWII spy novel and looking for a good (no words (lyrics) ) soundtrack to put on in the background and help me get immersed during my commute. </p> <p>Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Betty Smith’s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a wonderful coming-of-age novel that explores themes of poverty, resilience, education, family, gender roles, and the immigrant experience, among many others in early 20th-century America. Many of these themes are still relevant today. The book is way better than the film, which itself is very good.</p> <p>What knocked me out was Smith&#39;s ability to develop the character of <span class="md-spoiler-text">Francie</span> from a young child to a young woman in such a gradual way that by the end of the book, I felt as though I had grown up with her. Her ability to absorb the hurts of childhood tormentors was inspiring, but the teenager&#39;s apparent forgiveness of the liar <span class="md-spoiler-text">Lee</span> may have been too saint-like for credulity.</p> <p>However, I particularly related to the character of the alcoholic father, <span class="md-spoiler-text">Johnny</span>, who struggled with a condition

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would say it depends on the kind of humor the author is working with. Many dark humor books are able to pull it off, for instance, because dark humor is often situational. You can just describe the situation, and it&#39;s funny (i.e.: someone has uncontrollable rectal Niagara Falls and is in pain but it&#39;s funny). However, if the humor is visual, description may not always work. I mean the kind of visual where camera angle is in play. For instance, we only see a man&#39;s torso and the man is moaning, so we assume he&#39;s getting the head, but then the camera zooms out and we see the full body of the man and it is revealed that he is getting a leg massage by a professional. Or when the humor is in the way a line is delivered or the character&#39;s facial expression. An author can describe the voice tone and the expression, but I think the humor hits much harder when it is shown. What do you think? Does humor work in books just as well as it doe
