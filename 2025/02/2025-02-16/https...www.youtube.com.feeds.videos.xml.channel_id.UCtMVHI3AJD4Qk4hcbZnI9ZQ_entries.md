Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time I'm shocked to say a world leader has promoted a crypto rug pull, the largest one in history actually. Over $100 million in losses and fingers being pointed has everyone wondering just who was really behind all this. Thanks for watching!

Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! As I transtition to AMD, I'm watching the consumer GPU space for announcments and am in hopes for an actual competitor to Nvidia's long-running series of RTX enabled GPUs. AMD has been a long running competitor for a while but it's growing ever apparent we need to have serious catching up or else we'll see nothing but what NVIDIA wants to show going forward. Thanks for watching!
