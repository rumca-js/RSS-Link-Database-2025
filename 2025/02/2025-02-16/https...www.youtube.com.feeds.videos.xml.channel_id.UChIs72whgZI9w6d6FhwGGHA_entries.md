In hardware news this week, we're talking about the burned 12VHPWR (and 12V-2x6) cables and connectors on the NVIDIA RTX 50 series GPUs now, including the 5090s. Additionally, Cyberpower has responded to GN's review, AMD announced the announcement of its previously announced RX 9070 GPUs, Meta is allegedly pirating content for AI, and the 5060 Ti is rumored to exist.
