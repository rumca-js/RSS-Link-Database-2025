For example, if I plug in Streets of Rage 2, it does not boot up Sonic &amp; Knuckles. instead it boots up Blue Sphere minigame. Has anyone been able to have it boot up Sonic &amp; Knuckles game with another game plugged in? If so, does it have something to do with the size of the attached game?</p> <p>-A YouTuber said that if you attach Sonic 1 or the Sonic Classics game, it will bring up the blue sphere game with a level select. When I do it, it doesn&#39;t let me select a level,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there folks! I&#39;m trying to remember the name of a very old military space fighter game. Before anyone says it, it wasn&#39;t Wing Commander. But it was a similar play style to it. I recall you were awarded promotions and chest bars for your victories. An annoying element at the start was you were allocated an irritating veteran wing leader pilot. One of them was named &quot;Iceman&quot;! You could use a cheat to instantly blow up your target, which I used to get rid of the annoying so called wing leader pilots, so I could play in peace!. The General even ends up saying &quot;Damnit, we can&#39;t afford to keep losing veteran pilots like this, you&#39;ll have to fly by yourself from now on!&quot; Any ideas on the Name/Title of this game? Tbh I&#39;m not 100% sure it was a pc game, it was that long ago. There&#39;s an outside chance it might&#39;ve been an Amiga title, I just can&#39;t remember. Thanks all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>An interesting app for retrogaming on PC.</p> <p>Hey folks! I recently developed an app which functions to simulate the dynamically changing &#39;high frequency&#39; sound a CRT TV produced. Is it annoying for some? Perhaps. Is it nostalgic? Definitely! Perfect for added immersion if you like the appeal of oldschool TVs - I recommend using with a CRT shader.</p> <p>NOT a constant tone - it seriously reproduces bursts, twists, and occasionally &quot;crackles&quot; directly in sync with the monitor in a very authentic manner. I thought it could be appreciated amongst fans of retro things! I developed it when I thought - &quot;there are CRT shaders, but I also want that particular sound.&quot;.</p> <p>On my product page you can see a video preview which shows intro to a game - one of my favorites - Metal Gear Solid 2, first part of the video is without, second part is with the program, so skip to that part if you want to listen immediately.</p> <p><a hr

## Today's grab required a quick 300 km round trip. The seller asked $80 for the games and $50 per console. When I said I wanted the games and 1 console, he included the 2nd as it was rougher. Not bad for $130 CAD, and overlays and manuals are present for all.
