<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>does anyone know a software (compatible with Wayland) which allows pressing buttons when <em>releasing</em> a gamepad button?<br/> I have a Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog which has a lot of switches which <em>hold</em> the button in the on state.</p> <p>That means if I want to use the switch in a game to toggle something, I need to turn it on -&gt; button press, turn it off and turn it on again -&gt; another button press.<br/> However, I need it like turn it on -&gt; button press, turn it off -&gt; button press.</p> <p>Is there any software that can do this? I found a lot of key remappers but they only react on key presses, not releases. I can see the press and release with <code>evtest</code> so this should be possible:</p> <pre><code>Event: time 1739744178.926996, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 90013 Event: time 1739744178.926996, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 706 (BTN_TRIGGER_HAPPY3), value 1 Event: time 1739744178.926996, -----

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a need for this right now but I was just thinking about how screenshare kinda sucks on Linux compared to windows and how a capture card <em>could</em> completely bypass that. The problem seems to be that every capture card on the market uses hdmi instead of displayport and well good luck getting 4k 240hz working over hdmi via anything but the Nvidia proprietary drivers on Linux.</p> <p>So basically there is no possible way to have such a setup on Linux with AMD? Even 4k 120hz like on my tv seems sketchy like sometimes you can get it via dsc and sometimes not and if you do dsc seems buggy on Linux, if it&#39;s even been implemented for that hardware for Linux at all. With my current Intel based laptop you <em>never</em> get 4k 120hz on first boot via a usb c to hdmi 2.1 adapter, you have to go to the settings, change the resolution to something else, and then change it back.</p> <p>Someone should really just make a capture card that h

I&#39;m running through lutris on Cachy so which is Arch based so the install file is through wine and a c drive link but it has the exact same folders as you would mod in windows. I add a mod like HideUI and it shows up in game but doesn&#39;t seem to work. Please help. I&#39;m new to Linux if I&#39;m fudging this up give me the directions I need. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste_Display4947"> /u/Waste_Display4947 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1iqja2r/wow_add_ons/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1iqja2r/wow_add_ons/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to play Rocksmith 2014 edition through steam, but I can&#39;t get it to launch. No matter which compatibility version I try using, if I press play, it spins for a minute, then the play button appears again, like it failed or something, but I don&#39;t get any kind of error. I figured this might be due to ubisoft&#39;s stupid uplay crap, so I tried opening ubisoft connect in lutris (which I previously got working and played some watch_dogs - I never got Star Wras Oultaws to run though), but after getting ubisoft connect to open and update, it now says &#39;This version of Ubisoft Connect is not compatible with your operating system&#39; no matter which runner I choose.</p> <p>I&#39;m ruing the latest update to Pop os 22.04 and have Nvidia driver 565, and I have an intel i9 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. Anybody know how I look into this further?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_McMunc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m very new to linux. I hardly know what I&#39;m doing. I was fed up with windows and switched to linux mint.</p> <p>When playing Terraria, my game works fine for a while. Some time later, it flickers once or twice. The next time the flicker occurs, the game window goes completely black. I can still hear the sound or use items or whatever, I just can&#39;t see my screen. At first I thought it was random/time related, but now I see that whenever I go to a specific area (slightly below and to the right of the shimmer to make a few houses), this problem occurs. I can alt-tab to see my desktop or whatever other window very fine. I could run the game on windows without any problem.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked this issue up but everyone who was dealing with it had an Nvidia graphics card. Below are the specs of my laptop.</p> <p>OS: Linux Mint 22.1 Cinnamon<br/> Cinnamon Version: 6.4.7 Linux Kernel: 6.8.0-53-generic Processor: 12th Gen Intel© Core™

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have finally decided to switch to linux and put my linux guides I bought to use. I&#39;ve found Nobara to work great for gaming and out performing windows on most games even run through wine and proton. My current and only issue Is that I bought in to the corsair accessory environment.<br/> I have a corsair dark core mouse, void pro headset and commander pro hub (with phanteks m25 fans)</p> <p>I have found that Icue doesn&#39;t seem to work at all and the hub doesn&#39;t work very well with coolercontrol</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions for accessories and cooling items that work better with linux solutions. I&#39;m especially looking for a control center like Icue. I know I probably wont have the same features all in one app, but I like being able to control the RGB in the devices and setting my own fan curves based on internal sensors instead of probes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/
