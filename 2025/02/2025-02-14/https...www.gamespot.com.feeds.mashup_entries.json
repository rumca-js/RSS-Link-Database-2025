And when we say \"lineup,\" we actually mean it literally this time, as you can see the entire crew assembled for a police lineup above. For a much closer look at each of these skins, scroll down to the gallery below for some individual glamor shots.</p><p>The highlight, no doubt, is the lone collaboration on the battle pass: Sub-Zero from the fighting game series Mortal Kombat. There are eight distinct characters included in the reveal, so this should be every skin in the battle pass. Keep in mind, ",
