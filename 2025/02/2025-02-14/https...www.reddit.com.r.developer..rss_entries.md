<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I want to ask if you use matcha or coffee as your energy boost. I find it when I drink coffee it makes me highly alert for full hours but when it wears off it my focus and energy just plunging. Then I tried matcha, the energy boost is slower but lasting longer. It doesnâ€™t have the issue like coffee that you felt suddenly energy decreases. Which one would you prefer?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Research3811"> /u/Ok-Research3811 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ip8pen/would_you_prefer_coffee_or_matcha/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ip8pen/would_you_prefer_coffee_or_matcha/">[comments]</a></span>
