Spiritbox have released "No Loss, No Love" - their third single from the forthcoming album - "Tsunami Sea". I think it's the heaviest track I've reviewed recently and in parts, I was lost for words. The sheer power of Courtney LaPlante's voice is incredible. 

The new Darkness album comes out next month,  you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/

The Darkness are also going on tour across the UK in March, tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/
