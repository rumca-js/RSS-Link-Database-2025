Tested beat saber and it felt so immersive and gorgeous, I started dreaming of buying my own vr set. Then enter my husband who has not tried VR2. He was very opposed to the idea of buying a VR2, not just because of the price since we don\u2019t have a P5 to begin with, but also because in his opinion the Meta Quest is far superior. Today he had rented a Meta Quest 3 and we were very excited to try it. We tried a couple of games and it was great fun. </p> <p>Afterwards I said that though the MQ3 was really awesome I still stood by my opinion that I thought the VR2 felt more immersive. The colors, resolution felt more gorgeous and sound quality with the headphones made me feel I was really someplace else. I speculated if it was because of the oled display, Idunno I\u2019m no expert. He as I said before did not agree, he explained that ",

I want to rig them in a configuration where I can have them side by side to make two videos in 4K 60fps with same settings. I want to then encode these videos into a spatial video which I can then view with my Meta Quest 3. I saw an app called \u201cspatial encoder\u201d for Mac, is this sufficient for my purpose? Is there some additional step for this? I tried looking around online but most people just mention either spatial videos directly with a single iphone or very expensive solutions like Canon R5 with double fisheye VR lens.
