As we all love to selfhost we imagine many of you have already been down this path for your robot vacuums but we definitely want to get the word out for those that might now know about this as an option. Valetudo is an open source software platform that allows local usage and control of certain robot vacuums and detaches them completely from their cloud connections. I really appreciate this community and hope that this does not violate any rules. I did read the rules and I do not see anything clear that this would be a no go but if so mods please just shut down this post.</p> <p>If you are interested in adding another sub to your collection check out <a href=\"/r/valetudorobotusers\">r/valetudorobotusers</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Squanchy2112\"> /u/Squanchy2112 </a> <br/> <",

I am looking to switch my DNS from public to locally hosted ideally something that can run on a raspberry pi and via a docker. Ideally, I want the stability of having dedicated hardware but replication is key as I want to ensure uptime (wife approval factor) on my network. Especially if I have to reboot the Raspberry Pi or if my NAS has an issue or update. I was looking at Pi-Hole but replication seems complex at best from what I have read. Wondering if there is a better option or if Pi-Hole has an easy-to-manage replication option. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Blackhawk_Ben\"> /u/Blackhawk_Ben </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ioypuz/best_local_dns_option_with_easy_replication/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",
