And the final chapter, where the strength of the human spirit is found within the body of a woman who owns nothing. Ohh my goodness, that book changed me.

Whenever someone mentions <em>Alice</em>, someone will inevitably show up to inform us that it&#39;s all about numbers, and people who disagree <em>just don&#39;t get it.</em> On the surface it makes sense, because Lewis Carroll was a mathematician; but I strongly suspect this idea has been exaggerated, and I want to try to explain why.</p> <p>There is math in <em>Alice</em>. There&#39;s actually quite a bit of it. But why do people keep saying there&#39;s <em>hidden</em> math? It&#39;s tempting to read all sorts of interpretations into Alice, because it&#39;s such an absurd story; but if you pick up the book and read it, you&#39;ll find the jokes about math are usually just...well, jokes. They&#39;re simple witticisms. A grea",
