It&#8217;s just a way of signaling you can&#8217;t be trusted with the house&#8217;s money.

If you want to write something on the U.S. government&#8217;s official DOGE website, apparently you can just… do that. Not in the usual way of submitting comments through a form, mind you, but by directly injecting content into their database. This seems suboptimal.
