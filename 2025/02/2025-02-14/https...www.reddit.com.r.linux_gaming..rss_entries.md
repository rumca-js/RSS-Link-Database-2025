<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Arch is considered to be the goto distro is you want to game on Linux and yet I see that many people use fedora and I don&#39;t know why. That isn&#39;t to say that its bad or wrong, but why did you choose fedora over arch? I chose arch because the releases are faster than debian and fedora being based on redhat I saw as a negative.

The beta works 90% ok on my ally x, which is also using Bazzite, but loading the beta crashes plasma every time. The benchmark works ok, it even gave me a good score, though I had a minor bug with the polygons for the hunter&#39;s head while it ran. The beta however is just completely busted.</p> <p>The desktop on my second screen is completely black behind the windows I already had open.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s an issue on Gnome where you turn on scaling, games see your monitor&#39;s resolution scaled as well. I run a 2560x1600 display with 150% interface scaling and games see my monitor as much bigger than it is in reality (though not 150% bigger).</p> <p>This issue has been around for a while:<br/> <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/talk-fractional-display-scaling-in-workstation-makes-some-apps-games-blurry-or-incorrectly-sized/134755">https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/talk-fractional-display-scaling-in-workstation-makes-some-apps-games-blurry-or-incorrectly-sized/134755</a></p> <p>But I was not able to find a solution for this problem. People recommend running games at native resolution but it causes them to look blurry due to some double interpolation that happens behind the scenes (first small resolution -&gt; big resolution to &quot;trick&quot; the game&#39;s engine, than to small resolution again to display it).</p> <

The ones I tried Ubuntu in GNOME and KDE Version and Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition, wich I‘m currently using. </p> <p>The problem is that my main use case is gaming and Debian has more stable, but more outdated packages and I felt like some games ran slower on Linux than on Windows, one reason why the switch isn’t done yet. So yeah, I’m looking for a more current distro wich runs newer packages so gaming works better. </p> <p>I thought about Pop!OS, the upcoming official SteamOS for Desktop or even Arch Linux, but I wanted to get some other opinions first. I have no fear of the terminal, I’m pretty used to it because of my Ubuntu Server, but after setting up my OS I don’t want to troubleshoot my PC every second day, so a little stability isn’t wrong. </p> <p>Also depending on my Distro I also look for

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry this is probably a real niche question... but I&#39;m debating moving back to Linux however one thing I&#39;m concerned about is the built in wifi of my B550m Aorus board which used the Realtek 8852CE. Out of the box with the driver installed on windows it was dire, lag spikes, and packet loss were horrendous. </p> <p>However I managed to fix it from the following post:<br/> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/1bhw1n7/b650_realtek_wifi_dropsping_spikes_solution/">https://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/1bhw1n7/b650_realtek_wifi_dropsping_spikes_solution/</a></p> <p>My question is, is this network adapter supported (probably looking at a arch based distro). Secondly I suspect the issue will persist in Linux so can these fixes be implemented like I&#39;ve done with Windows? Basically I think its to do with very small packets and the over aggressive roaming causes the loss.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr

Turned on = pink filter, turned off = normal. Running a 4090 with 7800X3D driver version 535.183.01. Don&#39;t know if the most recent I could have but it was installed automatically for ease of use and worked fined except for the frame gen part.

The error seems to be related to .NET 4.8. Has anyone managed to get it working? Otherwise, is Cheat Engine a better alternative on Linux?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your feedb

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I installed Tumbleweed yesterday (switching from Endeavor OS) on my HP-Omen (Ryzen 5, RTX 3060) and installed NVIDIA drivers with YAST (which seem to be installed correctly).</p> <p>I installed Steam with zypper and tried running a few games (Morrowind, Cyberpunk 2077, Crusader Kings 3, Baldurs Gate 3) and in all of them they Play button turns back to green after a few seconds. Steam Play is enabled and I tried a few different Proton versions as well. I&#39;m using Gnome with Wayland.</p> <p>I would be happy to get any guidance on what might have gone wrong and what to check.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking about doing a re-install of Tumbleweed tonight, and I&#39;d like to use a recent setup that should work. I&#39;ve tried googling, and the issue popped up a few times, but I couldn&#39;t really find a fix.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Typos</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oz1mand1as"> /u/oz1m

I currently have Bazzite on my full AMD HTPC and, even though I really like the features Bazzite have, there are a couple of things that kinda bother me:</p> <ol> <li>In Bazzite gaming mode, there is no way to change priority on audio output and save it. I can do that on my friend&#39; Steam Deck though.</li> <li>I have my monitor next to my TV, and I send the image to my monitor when going to desktop mode. 5 times out of 10, the desktop shows nothing but the pointer, completely bugged.</li> </ol> <p>Would it be a good idea to have Steam OS recovery image over Bazzite?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Forgive me if I&#39;m a bit out of touch with the technical aspects of it, but I personally find the whole kernel level anti-cheat debacle to be a bit ridiculous. Even if EAC, BattleEye, etc are forced to run in user space, couldn&#39;t they require you to run some sort of MAC like SELinux or AppArmor (something most popular distributions ship with OOTB) and just refuse to run the process if it&#39;s not configured properly or missing? They both already have mitigations for things like process injection and full memory read/write access, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Ignoring the obvious resource aspect of it, I don&#39;t see why anti-cheat devs couldn&#39;t get around the whole user space restriction. The devs behind Marvel Rivals seem to have it pretty well figured out and I haven&#39;t seen a single cheater on that game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RagingTaco334"> /u/RagingTaco334 </a> <br/> <s
