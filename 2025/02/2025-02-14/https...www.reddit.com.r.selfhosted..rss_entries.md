We couldn&#39;t get into Amazon SES after going through their setup process and I decided to go with MailCow. </p> <p>I got a VPS with the necessary ports open and setup was a breeze. The problem is that all emails (all transactional for now) are delivered to the spam folder and we have to explicitly tell users to check and click that the email is not spam. Also it doesn&#39;t deliver to Outlook mail at all. </p> <p>I have read about relays and I wanted to try Google&#39;s SMTP relay by paying for a single Workspace account.

Also if this doesn&#39;t work, what other solutions are at my disposal. I am kinda desperate.</p> <p>Also, I had a re

I want to set up a domain for said small group of friends to connect through in the future. (As well as any web services I fancy.) and I also wish to set up a reverse proxy for added security. </p> <p>Do you guys recommend any newbie-friendly easy domain hosts and reverse proxies? I was looking at Cloudflare for domain needs but a lot of guides said Cloudflare is more for advanced users.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwitchtheChangeling"> /u/SwitchtheChangeling </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ip1fr2/self_hosting_game_servers_wanting_to_tie_a_domain/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ip1fr2/self_hosting_ga

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, so I recently decided to make multiple upgrades to my home lab and I am tumbling down the rabbit hole, looking for some advice. I am looking to switch my DNS from public to locally hosted ideally something that can run on a raspberry pi and via a docker. Ideally, I want the stability of having dedicated hardware but replication is key as I want to ensure uptime (wife approval factor) on my network. Especially if I have to reboot the Raspberry Pi or if my NAS has an issue or update. I was looking at Pi-Hole but replication seems complex at best from what I have read. Wondering if there is a better option or if Pi-Hole has an easy-to-manage replication option. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blackhawk_Ben"> /u/Blackhawk_Ben </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ioypuz/best_local_dns_option_with_easy_replication/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https
