<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A younger sibling of mine is just a loud human being. Plays loud music and doesn’t care if it’s bothering other people. She had a google speaker and I was able to hack into it with the google app and turn down the sound, she noticed it was tweaking so, she got a new speaker and I don’t know the name of it. But it’s loud in the morning while I’m still sleeping. How can I hack into the speaker and at least limit its volume to 25% or something like that? The speaker sounds pretty big and bassey, it’s really loud and annoying. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lion-beans5"> /u/Lion-beans5 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ipd9c1/how_to_crash_the_sound/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ipd9c1/how_to_crash_the_sound/">[comments]</a></span>
