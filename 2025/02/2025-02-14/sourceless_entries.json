This funding was diverted toward questionable projects that promoted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda.\n....\n\nOne of these claimed \"woke DEI grants\" is Emily Riehl's project \"Homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory\".  In case you don't know, she's one of the best mathematicians working on category theory in the USA.   \n\nYou can see a complete list of all 3,400 \"woke DEI grants\" on a spreadsheet which is linked from the Senate web page:\n\nhttps://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-i",
