<p>Do you want a huge amount of usable display space, but without the hassle of a double-monitor setup? An ultrawide monitor is the ticket. Ultrawide monitors have a wider display panel that provides an immersive experience and far more screen real-estate than your average widescreen. </p>



<p>I’ve tested a bunch of ultrawide monitors in order to name the best picks in various categories ranging from those optimized for gaming to those suited for professional use. Below you’ll find a curated list of my favorites in each category. I describe my evaluation process for monitors at the bottom of this article.</p>

## Watch out: Amazon searches might soon push you off of Amazon entirely

<p>I’ve probably spent more time combing through Amazon listings than most people, if only because I have to do it for Amazon’s various Prime Day sales events. The Amazon shopping experience has become progressively more frustrating over the years, as they fill up with promoted and sponsored listings crowding out the stuff I’m actually looking for. But it’s about to get worse.</p>



<p>Customers will be given an option to “Shop brand sites directly” (i.e., leave Amazon.com to shop somewhere else). If you’re subscribed to Amazon Prime, you might get faster shipping and other perks. A full post on <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/search-products-amazon-shopping-feature">Amazon’s promotional page</a> goes more in-depth.</p>

## How long does data last on a USB flash drive? It’s complicated

<p>The lifespan of data on a USB flash drive depends on many factors: Under ideal conditions, data should remain preserved on a high-quality USB stick for at least 10 years or even longer. But what exactly does that mean and under what conditions does this hold true? </p>



<p>USB sticks or flash drives store data using NAND flash memory, in the form of binary values (zeros and ones) in memory cells. Interestingly, it is electrons trapped in a kind of “floating gate” that represent these values. But these electrons can “leak” over time. This causes the data to degrade because it becomes harder to read whether the charge state represents a one or a zero.</p>

<p>Graphics cards are getting crazy expensive, yet again. Between high demand, low supply, and broader trade wars, the launch of Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs is bringing back traumatic memories of the pandemic. (Specifically about graphics cards, I suppose there’s plenty of trauma to go around there.) The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">GeForce RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2591060/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review.html">RTX 5080</a> disappeared from store shelves instantly, and now, the first retail listings for the incoming RTX 5070 Ti are showing massively inflated prices.</p>

<p>Using a password manager is a smart move. So is protecting your primary email account with a strong credentials. Combining the two seems like an equally good call, but it’s actually dangerous—should you ever lock yourself out of your password manager, you run the risk of losing access to your email account. Also if your password vault is ever compromised, your email account becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access.</p>



<p>I wrote a warning last year <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2225483/you-should-always-memorize-these-two-passwords.html">about this hazard</a>, and then again <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2591729/stop-saving-your-email-login-info-in-your-password-manager.html">earlier this month</a>.

<p>The first 45-inch OLED bendable gaming monitor, the <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/monitors/cm-9030001-na/corsair-xeneon-flex-45wqhd240-45-inch-oled-3440-x1440-240hz-refresh-rate-bendable-gaming-monitor-cm-9030001-na">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a> (45WQHD240) got a whole lot right for a new gaming technology. It promised (and delivered) beautiful visuals that did a better job of mimicking the 3D experience than a flat monitor could. Curved monitors do that too, of course, but the obvious advantage of the Xeneon Flex was that you could choose the level of immersion you want by adjusting the display’s curvature.</p>



<p>That said, CES 2025 has yielded a new and improved bendable gaming monitor in the <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/12/lg-unveils-worlds-first-bendable-5k2k-gaming-monitor-winner-of-three-awards-at-ces-2025/">LG UltraGear OLED</a

<p>There are various reasons why Windows does not start. The first assumption is a defect in the boot environment that prevents the system from starting. However, causes can also be a defective file system, defective system files, or a hardware problem.</p>



<p>Errors manifest themselves differently depending on the cause. If the screen remains completely black after you have switched on the PC or laptop, there is probably a hardware fault.</p>
