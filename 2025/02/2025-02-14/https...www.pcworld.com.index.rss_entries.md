<p>Recently, many of us Apple TV users managed to do something miraculous — namely, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2609395/netflix-comes-to-the-apple-tv-app-sort-of.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2609395/netflix-comes-to-the-apple-tv-app-sort-of.html">connect Netflix to the Apple TV app</a>. Well, there’s good news and bad news. Actually… just bad news. </p>



<p>Apple has now confirmed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">via The Verge</a> that the short-lived ability to add Netflix as a connected service on the Apple TV app was actually just a bug and has been “rolled back.” </p>



<p>That explains why the Netflix integration some of us experienced earlier today on the Apple TV app was so flaky. For example, while I was able to add Netflix as a connected service on t

<p>If you do any video editing work, you probably know how taxing it can be on your laptop. So, when browsing for a laptop for video editing, you’ll want to make sure your rig is suited up with the proper hardware. </p>



<p>Depending on your work load, you may not need a top-tier machine to get the job done. That said, a gaming laptop may not be the right choice, especially one with a lower resolution display. A powerful processor and graphics are a given, but you’ll need to take other factors into consideration such as the quality of the display and port selection.</p>

<p>It’s rare to find a laptop that offers great specs and features for under $500. But today, Lenovo is doing just that via its official eBay store account. The Lenovo Slim 7, which features a touchscreen, a Core i7 processor, and 16GB of RAM, is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/156610652557">going for $495.99</a>. That’s over $700 off its original price. The catch? It’s refurbished.</p>



<p>Though it has a slightly older processor, the same model is still going for about $900 if you want a brand-new one. Lenovo’s eBay store is even beating out the company’s own online listing for the refurbished version, and for some reason eBay offers a two-year Allstate warranty with it. That’s double the coverage from the factory store.</p>



<p>We called this laptop “boring yet sensible” <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2277039/lenovo-slim-7-14-review.html">i

<p>I’ve probably spent more time combing through Amazon listings than most people, if only because I have to do it for <s>the bane of my existence</s> Amazon’s various Prime Day sales events. The Amazon shopping experience has become progressively more frustrating over the years, as they fill up with promoted and sponsored listings crowding out the stuff I’m actually looking for. But it’s about to get worse.</p>



<p>Jeffrey Cohen, Amazon’s Ads Tech Evangelist, showed off the newest feature for the company’s iOS and Android apps <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7216836378095968260/?utm_source=swipeinsight.app&utm_medium=referral">on LinkedIn</a> (spotted by <a href="https://searchengineland.com/amazon-expands-ad-offerings-non-amazon-sellers-444060">Search Engine Land</a>).

<p>If you’re in the market for a powerful gaming laptop that’ll remain relevant for a few years, then here’s one worth jumping on: Best Buy is selling this <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-16-fhd-165hz-gaming-laptop-intel-13th-gen-core-i7-16gb-ram-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-512gb-ssd-eclipse-gray/6572582.p?skuId=6572582">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 gaming laptop for just $1,080</a>. That’s a whopping $520 off its original $1,600 MSRP and an absolutely killer price for a laptop equipped with a GeForce RTX 4070.</p>



<p>We love the Asus ROG Zephyrus G16. We gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, appreciating its high gaming performance and superb screen. Our review unit was a bit more decked out than this configuration that’s on sale at Best Buy, but don’t let that turn you away. It’s still a fantastic laptop. Read the <a hre

<p>One of the biggest gaps in the Apple TV app looks like it’s about to be filled with Netflix making a long-awaited appearance. Just don’t expect a fully integrated experience or at least not yet. </p>

<p>If you’re like me and you can remember the distinct sounds of dial-up, then you’re likely keenly aware that you need a better desk chair. Stop ignoring your back pain at the end of the workday!</p>



<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to drop a ton of cash if you jump on this hot deal. Right now, <a href="https://www.staples.com/union-scale-flexfit-dexley-ergonomic-mesh-swivel-task-chair-black-un56946/product_24398921">Staples is selling its Dexley chair for $120</a>, which is a massive 60 percent off its original $300 MSRP.</p>



<p>The Staples Dexley is the brother to the Staples Hyken chair, which we also recommend as an affordable ergonomic option for your home office. But the Dexley is larger and wider, better for folks who need more space, so keep that in mind when deciding which one you’re going for.</p>
