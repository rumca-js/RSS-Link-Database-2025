It works perfectly fine for a few days and then it just stops. The game loads up fine. but when I go to resume game it takes me to the load game screen and tells me that I am missing packs, so I tried to bypass it and load the save anyway, but the pop up comes up telling me that there is content missing from the save. So of course, I went and did it all again and it worked. The thing is though, how do I avoid having to do this every few days because it is so annoying? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crafty_Improvement39\"> /u/Crafty_Improvement39 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1ipkpzs/sims_4_winrar_expansion_packs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1ipkpzs/sims_4_winrar_expansion_packs/\">[comm",
