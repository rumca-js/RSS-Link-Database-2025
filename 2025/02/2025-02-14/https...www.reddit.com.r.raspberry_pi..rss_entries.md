<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to send DMX from a Raspberry Pi, and traditionally I&#39;ve just used one of Enttec&#39;s DMX USB Pro devices and that has worked fine. But for a new project, space is at a premium and I was thinking of using one of the RS485 hats (specifically, I have the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-can-hat.htm">Waveshare one</a>). I&#39;ve tested it with a Python script and it works fine for simple tests. The relevant code </p> <pre><code>dmx_packet = bytearray([0] + dmx_data) # Start Code (0) + 512 values # DMX BREAK (low for 88Âµs) ser.break_condition = True time.sleep(0.000088) # 88Âµs ser.break_condition = False # Mark After Break (MAB) (high for 8Âµs) time.sleep(0.000008) # 8Âµs # Send DMX data ser.write(dmx_packet) ser.flush() </code></pre> <p>Is this a bad idea? What pitfalls might I face here? </p> <p>I&#39;d like to use a Zero 2 W, but I&#39;m open to using a 5 if performance would be a cause for concern.</p> <p>The other options is to use
