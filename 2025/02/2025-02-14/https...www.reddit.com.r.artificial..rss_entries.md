<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This paper investigates how frequency-dependent methods improve Sound Event Detection (SED) by analyzing FilterAugment and Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDY Conv). The researchers performed systematic experiments to understand why these techniques work, using visualization methods and simplified variants to isolate key components.</p> <p>Main technical points: - Grad-CAM analysis shows both methods help models focus on frequency-specific features - FilterAugment&#39;s random frequency emphasis during training improves robustness - FDY Conv adapts its kernels differently across frequency bands - PCA analysis reveals structured patterns in kernel adaptation - Simplified FDY Conv variants maintain most performance benefits</p> <p>Key results: - FilterAugment improved performance by 0.8-1.2% on DESED dataset - FDY Conv showed 1.5% improvement over baseline - Combined methods demonstrated complementary effects - Kernel adaptation patterns correlate with
