But what exactly does that mean and under what conditions does this hold true? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>USB sticks or flash drives store data using NAND flash memory, in the form of binary values (zeros and ones) in memory cells. Interestingly, it is electrons trapped in a kind of \u201cfloating gate\u201d that represent these values. But these electrons can \u201cleak\u201d over time.
