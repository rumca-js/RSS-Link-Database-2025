        "description": "Spiritbox have released \"No Loss, No Love\" - their third single from the forthcoming album - \"Tsunami Sea\". I think it's the heaviest track I've reviewed recently and in parts, I was lost for words. The sheer power of Courtney LaPlante's voice is incredible. \n\nThe new Darkness album comes out next month,  you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nThe Darkness are also going on tour across the UK in March, tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nTo talk to me on Patreon:  http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview #spiritbox",
