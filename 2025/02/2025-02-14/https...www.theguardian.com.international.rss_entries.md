<p>Mel Brooks’s unapologetically in-your-face western spoof broke all the rules and redefined satire – it is just as relevant for today’s polarised world</p><p>As part of a long career, Mel Brooks created Blazing Saddles, released in 1974. For me, it redefined satire for the 20th century. The film was made at a time when America was in crisis. It had just been through the Vietnam war and the civil rights movement. The country was deeply divided and in the midst of a serious identity crisis – like it is again today. Against this background, and surely in need of a good laugh, Brooks decided to make a “comedy western”, two film genres that don’t traditionally go together.</p><p>Westerns were white American. Certainly, the earliest examples are propagandist. No other culture mythologises its own creation in such a cinematic way. One tried and tested western blueprint is the tale of the great white saviour bringing the savage land to heel. Blazing Saddles turns this formula on its head.

<p>It’s a witty, self-aware return for the show about a high school football team’s wilderness survival – a welcome break from its directionless second outing</p><p>When it first arrived on our screens, it was clear that Yellowjackets was a knockout idea. It took a girls’ high school football team, crashed their plane in a mysterious wilderness, and teased viewers with their eventual descent into sacrifice and cannibalism. That, alone, would have sustained most shows. But Yellowjackets divided itself in two and added a retro twist. The wilderness, flesh-eating years were flashbacks to the 90s, while it added an outer coating of the survivors as they are now, in their 40s, still trying to cover up what they did when stranded. It had an outstandingly culty cast, including Juliette Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci, and above all, it was a lot of fun.</p><p>But the second season faltered slightly and seemed unsure what to do with its own success. It lurched forward, but the plo
