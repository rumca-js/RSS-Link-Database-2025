import CMake; // Mastering C++ Modules - Bill Hoffman - CppCon 2024
---

C++20 modules represent a significant advancement in the language, promising to improve compile times, enhance code organization, and streamline dependency management. This talk is tailored for developers eager to harness the power of C++20 modules in their projects. We will explore the fundamentals of building both shared and static libraries using CMake, the de facto build system for C++.

Attendees will gain practical insights into setting up build files and organizing source code with modules. We will dissect real-world open-source module projects, offering a concrete understanding of how modules are being used in the wild. A key focus will be on the "import std" model, demonstrating how to create a module interface for large, existing libraries, facilitating a smoother transition to modular codebases.

Significantly, CMake released non-experimental support for C++20 modules in Octob
