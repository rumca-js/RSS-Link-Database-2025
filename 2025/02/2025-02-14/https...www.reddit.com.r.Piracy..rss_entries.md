<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, im not super educated when it comes to file recovery stuff. I&#39;ve looked this up before, and most people either have corrupted drives or failures, etc. I simply deleted a bunch of files off my C: drive and i&#39;d like them back. Was only a couple days ago. There&#39;s nothing wrong with my drives or anything. Can anyone point me to a safe and free file recovery program? I really like wondershare recoverit especially because it will show me the file names instead of &quot;folder&quot; making it easier. Anyone know where i could get a cracked version of that or another file recovery program?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drx_wz"> /u/drx_wz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ipn8ey/free_file_recovery_crack_or_key/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ipn8ey/free_file_recovery_crack_or_key/">[comme

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>VPN/VPS</p> <p>Hello, so I torrent on my PC regularly. The problem is I don’t use a VPN. While, I haven’t gotten any abuse complaints, I figure it’s time for me to be safer and change my ways. I also host Jellyfin on the same PC to serve the files I torrent. So for that reason I feel like a VPN would better suit my needs, that way I keep my whole setup, I just add a VPN. However, with a VPS I would be able to seed and download always since I don’t need my PC to be on, but then I would have to have a ton of cloud storage which would be expensive and move everything (jellyfin) over to the VPS (which honestly isn’t a problem, I have time).</p> <p>So my question is if I get a VPN, which one should I get? I hear AirVPN is good. I don’t really care too much about data privacy and all that, I just want my torrenting to be private. I would also like it to be compatible with Windows, Linux, and iOS since I would use it for general use.</p> <p>If I get a VPS,

The games are always up to date, the download is direct and super fast if you use Free Download Manager, and you don’t even need to install, just extract the folder.
