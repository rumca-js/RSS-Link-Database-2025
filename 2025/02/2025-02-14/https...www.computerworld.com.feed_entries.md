<p>Pixar Animation Studios has an unusual logo. The basic logo is the word “Pixar.” But sometimes, an animated lamp named Luxo Jr. hops into the frame and jumps on the letter “i.” The lap exudes personality and represents Pixar’s ability to turn any object into a compelling character. </p>



<p>Inspired by Luxo Jr., Apple’s Machine Learning Research division decided to create a personality-expressive lamp of their own. Apple’s ELEGNT research project explores what’s possible with an expressive physical user interface for <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3574918/who-needs-a-humanoid-robot-when-everything-is-already-robotic.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com

<p>On the one hand, notifications let us stay on top of important incoming info — be it a critical Slack message, a personal family text, or an email from a high-priority client or colleague.</p>



<p>On the other hand, man alive, can they be menacing — both distracting and also sometimes ineffective, when something significant comes in and you don’t notice it right away.</p>



<p>To be fair, Android’s got all sorts of smart systems for taming your notifications and making ’em more manageable <em>and </em>effective — both official and by way of crafty workaround. The
