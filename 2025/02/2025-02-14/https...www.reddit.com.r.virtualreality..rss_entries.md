The colors, resolution felt more gorgeous and sound quality with the headphones made me feel I was really someplace else. I speculated if it was because of the oled display, Idunno I’m no expert. He as I said before did not agree, he explained that

But some games don&#39;t seem to work without the meta quest app installed and running. </p> <p>The problem is the meta quest app is HOT GARBAGE. It takes up 30% of my GPU EVEN WHEN IM NOT PLAYING VR! </p> <p>Plus you can&#39;t kill this App! You end task, and it just pops back up, making my experience in VR AND flat games laggy and stuttering. </p> <p>My question is: Is there a patch or way around the app? I tried to launch the games from VD using openxr, and they crash. So there&#39;s something in the meta app that is needed. </p> <p>The game in question is Uboat: A Silent Wolf (steamVR)</p> <p>I&#39;ve been googling all week with no answer in sight. </p> <p>Thank you, </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MRLEGEND1o1"> /u/MRLEGEND1o1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:
