Cruz-Led Investigation Uncovers $2 Billion in Woke DEI Grants at NSF, Releases Full Database

U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released a database identifying over 3,400 grants, totaling more than $2.05 billion in federal funding awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) during the Biden-Harris administration. This funding was diverted toward questionable projects that promoted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda.
....

One of these claimed "woke DEI grants" is Emily Riehl's project "Homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory".  In case you don't know, she's one of the best mathematicians working on category theory in the USA.   

You can see a complete list of all 3,400 "woke DEI grants" on a spreadsheet which is linked from the Senate web page:
