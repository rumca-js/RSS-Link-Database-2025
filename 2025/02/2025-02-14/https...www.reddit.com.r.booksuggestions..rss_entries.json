Rufus and Dana in kindred or the Aliens in liliths brood or shuri &amp; Wyatt in fledgling. The relationship between the protagonist &amp; &quot;antagonist&quot; is never as black &amp; white as it seems. </p> <p>So this is the type of stuff i&#39;m looking for. Power imbalances, coercion, manipulation. Doesn&#39;t matterr, the relationship can be as problematic as possible as long as it&#39;s written in an interesting way. Any genre is appreciated. Also i&#39;m mostly looking for books with black female characters (since there is an abundant of stories like this with white characters) but other woc are also okay.
