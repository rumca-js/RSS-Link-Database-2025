I&#39;ve played probably over a hundred games and my Elo fluctuates between 200 and 300 on BGG, so I think we all get the basic strategy- optimize for cheaper Tier 2 &amp; 3 cards (a 7 pointer for 4 gems, a 6 pointer for 3, etc.) Use gold strategically to grab good cards. Don&#39;t emphasize nobles but keep an eye on them. Use Tier 1 cards only to build up a color that you need or want. Etc. etc.</p> <p>The issue is that last point, using Tier 1 cards to develop a color that you need. The issue is that <strong>whatever color you choose to specialize in may not necessarily be dealt again- that&#39;s the luck/randomness component.</strong> Example:</p> <p>I start the game by reserving a 4 point card that requires 7 reds. I buy a few red Tier 1s to build up my supply, and ultimately buy my 4 pointer. Now I have 3 or 4 or even 5 red cards, allowing me to very easily buy any other good red card",

While I had a great time, I was definitely way out of my depth. They brought out a game called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Havre_(board_game\">Le Havre</a>), an economic game that takes place in a specific French port. It seemed pretty complicated to me, but the others insisted it was one of the least complex games there.</p> <p>Shortly after starting, one of the players - who has playtested a lot of tabletop strategy games, and knows way more than me - said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s an engine-building game.&quot; A few of the others with similar amounts of experience agreed. When I asked, he explained that an &quot;engine&quot; in these kinds of games refers to a reinforcing loop that gets you more and more resources, like the money-property-rent cycle in Monopoly. ",
