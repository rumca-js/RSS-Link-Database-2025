<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to use RSS readers to build a monitor of news about several companies that I want to follow. I do this by constructing Google/Bing news feeds in the form: </p> <p><a href="https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Walmart&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Walmart&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=Starbucks&amp;format=rss">https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=Starbucks&amp;format=rss</a></p> <p>But the generated feeds always include a bunch of less relevant stuff. Are there better resources or techniques to achieve something like this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Accurate-Jump-9679"> /u/Accurate-Jump-9679 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ip9vac/rss_sources_for_company_news/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/commen
