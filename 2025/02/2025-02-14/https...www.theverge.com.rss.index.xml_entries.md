Maybe it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s part of our soft human inability to let go of the past, especially coming-of-age drama that seems increasingly romantic and <em>valid</em> as we continue hurtling toward old age and (hopefully) painless deaths. Maybe it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s the misplaced optimism that middle-aged reunions will evoke some kind of sobering epiphany about lost youth or, god forbid, a painful opportunity for personal growth or redemption.

<p>There are no bad iPads. That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet, you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year’s iPad, is still a solid device. Buying an older but better device — last year’s Pro instead of this year’s Air, for instance — is a tried-and-true
