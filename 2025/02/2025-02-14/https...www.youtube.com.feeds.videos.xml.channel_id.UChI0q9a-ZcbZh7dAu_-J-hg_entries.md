Nineteen years after the initially suppressed release of Idiocracy, a film that was made to be an absurd depiction of societal trends, is now more true than ever. As we continuously subvert our own critical thinking, every single day we get closer and closer to this demented caricature of modern consumerism, which is now closer to some sort of blueprint than it is to an irrelevant comedy.

We may have a different path to get there, but we are certainly racing towards a capitalist and corporate echo of a movie that should be something to simply laugh at. Instead we look around and see increasing similarities.
