I came up with The Preservation Principle as a result. I am writing a book on this, but I thought I would run this idea by the smart folks on here to stress test it.</p> <h1>1. The Preservation Principle</h1> <p><strong>&quot;Existence precedes essence.&quot;</strong><br/> <em>Because</em> sapience is the precondition for all thought, value, and meaning, its preservation is non-negotiable. Sapience must exist <strong>non-contingently</strong> (free from external dependency), with agency, diversity, and dispersion across disconnected systems (<em>Zeitgeists</em>).<br/> <strong>→ Logical Conclusion</strong>: Without t

The authors propose an Adaptive Learning Management System (ALMS) that leverages AI to tailor educational content to individual learner&#39;s needs, using general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs to mitigate issues such as factual inaccuracies and outdated information typical of traditional LLMs. The study reveals several key findings about the effectiveness of such a system:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Addressing Privacy and Cost Concerns:</strong> The proposed ALMS balances priv

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My mom is going to school for her bachelors for the first time and her history teacher failed her on a discussion post, accusing her of using AI when she didn’t. The professor put it through an “AI detector” which I know are loads of crap, I have my graduate degree and most things I write originally get flagged on those detectors for being AI. The only thing she did different from her other posts is she answered the questions in list form, instead of paragraph form, with the country and then the information in list format below it. It was the easiest way for her to format it. She used in text citations and cited all her sources at the end. The prof said to email her to defend her work and she will “maybe” switch the grade.
