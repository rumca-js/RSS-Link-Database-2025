Sometimes, it’s the forbidden, the tragic, or even just the subtle moments between characters that stay with us long after we close the book. Love isn’t always beautiful—it can be bittersweet, complicated, or even entirely unspoken. Here are some books that deeply moved me with their romantic elements, even if they weren’t strictly “romance” novels.</p> <h1>The Justice of Kings by Richard Swan</h1> <p>I want to start with a rather controversial romance. Helena, the narrator of the book, is a young woman coming of age in a world ruled by law, justice, and the heavy hands that uphold them. And what belongs to every coming-of-age story? Love.

It has a few flash backs in the first section and a couple reasonable spots to breathe, but overall is a fast paced adventure through an insane city. The world building is incredible and the ever expanding City and the reasons for it are great. There’s also tons of gods that grant people powers that are very unique and add a ton of character.

These versatile, all-capable characters often serve as convenient solutions to complex problems.

As a result, they can feel more like a narrative tool meant to move the plot forward, rather than a fully developed character with flaws and meaningful growth.</p> <p>I’d love to read stories about “true” losers: Billy Pilgrim in “Slaughterhouse-Five” by Kurt Vonnegut JR, and Kathy/Tommy/Ruth in “Never Le

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently read <em>The Winter Road</em> by Adrian Selby and I loved the combination of how gritty and violent it was plus the herbalism. It was the herbalism that I enjoyed the most: not just potions or berries that magically return your ‘health’ in a game-y kind of way, but leaves that are like onion layers to put on your eyes to see better at night, but it hurts. ‘Fightbrews’ that require someone else to keep your mouth closed so you don’t vomit it up again. It felt really ‘raw’!</p> <p>I know Adrian Selby wrote other books set in the same world, but I would like more of that. The raw herbalism (or similar ‘nature’ things; nothing chemical or overtly magical) is what I’m looking for the most. If it’s got a gritty, violent or folk horror vibe to it as well, that’s a bonus!</p> <p>Thank you and have a great weekend!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GirlWithBonesaw"> /u/GirlWithBonesaw </a> <br/>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Admin delete if not allowed. </p> <p>I have a very specific request. My favourite kind of fantasy books are ones with an ensemble cast (multiple main characters), often with them all in different locations having different adventures to start, and then the plot weaves them into the one story and you see how it all comes together. </p> <p>Some of my favourite books include Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon, Truthwitch by Susan Dennard, There will come a darkness by Katy Rose Pool, Hope and Red by Jon Skovron, The Diviners by Libba Bray … sprawling, complex stories about strangers who end up saving the world together (or similar). But these kinds of books are surprisingly hard to find, at least in modern publishing - and I prefer modern books because I like women with agency, and queer romance, which are both notably absent from most of the 70s/80s fantasy books that tend to have more ‘epicness’ in them. Either YA or adult is fine. </p> <p>
