He was to the point - stated facts, and stated consequences for those that did not comply - no vagueness or game playing. I thought this was really interesting and I wish the politicians over the past 30 years or so actually did this. I am not sure things would actually turn out as presented in this movie nowadays if you actually talked to people with facts like they did in the movie - &quot;example - there were only a couple hundred people trying to break into the underground bunker in this movie but if this comet was actually going to hit the earth I think it would be thousands and thousands more.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",

It\u2019s pretty awful. On their first movie, he randomly hit the extras with his sword while they were getting food so hard that they would\u2019ve been killed if they weren\u2019t wearing helmets.

We learn, in turn, that he is perfectly willing to use violence in defense of the law, that he is perfectly willing to use violence with the law as a cover, and then, finally, that he is simply a violent, vindictive man who casually kills and abuses his authority. It also shows him as a sarcastic and rather funny character who takes his many killings quite lightly, but is someone who at least pretends to have a belief in law and order.</p> <p>We also learn, solely through brief reaction shots, a lot about Mattie&#39;s character as her i",

I decided to watch one of my favorite Disney movies of all time....<em>Tangled</em>. This is not only one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, as I said, but also probably tied with <em>Frozen</em> as my favorite of the post-2000s Disney Era. Yes, I know there are objectively better films from the modern era like <em>Zootopia</em> and <em>Encanto</em>. But for my, <em>Tangled</em> is my all-time favorite (along with...well, you know).</p> <p>The animation is absolutely beautiful, cozy, and still holds extremely, especially with the colors, the comedy also equally still holds up and I found myself laughing at a lot of points, the songs are memorable and catchy, I see The Light and the scene that goes with it is probably the highlight of the movie and one of, if not the most beautiful moment in have seen in any Disney film ever, Mother Gothel is truly the last great Di",

And not only that, the subtitles say it\u2019s her. I just wonder what the thought of this is here. I never realized it was her till like the third viewing, and then recently with the subtitles on it just flat out says it\u2019s her. Is this an accident or on purpose? Like, if you had never seen the movie and watched it with subtitles on (which unfortunately is recommended for Nolan films) and the first 5 mins it gives it away that it\u2019s her, even though it would be hard to catch that or understand what\u2019s going on anyways. </p> <p>I just wonder if anyone has noticed that or what to think of it I guess lol.

Not looking for plot twists you didn&#39;t like but still fit the narrative pretty well, but more like ones that completely made everything before and after worse off. </p> <p>For me, it&#39;s The Dressmaker. The first 30-45 mins are okay, seems like a romantic drama starring Kate Winslet and Sarah Snook with beautiful costumes. The movie feels light and funny in parts. But then &gt;! Kate Winslet&#39;s fortunes go downhill faster than you can say A Serious Man (by the Coen Brothers). Her love interest, Liam Hemsworth, drowns in sorghum inside a grain silo (she witnesses it). Then more people die in gruesome ways, and Kate Winslet ends up blowing up the town at the end. Tone-wise, it is so off... !&lt;</p> <p>The plot choices completely ruin some of the great things it had going for it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",

My girlfriend and I are watching it and my goodness how far society had fallen to the point where there media doesn&#39;t even seem like it has any meaning. I am just having a blast with how ridiculous it is. Won&#39;t say anything else to describe the movie for those that want to see it, but what about everyone else that has seen it?</p> <p>I seriously think it also has one of my favorite hilariously passive aggressive barbs two best friends shoot at each other when they&#39;re having a fight but ultimately still love one another.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GritsKingN797\"> /u/GritsKingN797 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ioyhbe/sorry_to_bother_you2018_feels_so_apt_for_what_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ioyhbe/sorry_to_bother_you2018_feels_s",
