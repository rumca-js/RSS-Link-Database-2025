It\u2019s the roar of a wrestler\u2019s body-slam or a diva\u2019s ovation \u2013 throaty, triumphant, immoderate. Thomas\u2019s exhibition is all that, and glamorous too, opening with a room of monumental portraits of black women. All are painted on panels with rounded corners \u2013 no frame is enclosing <em>these</em> women.</p><p>Working from staged photographs and found images, Thomas\u2019s compositions are hymns to excess. Figures emerge in fragments from layers of pattern, like the swirling kimonos that unfurl to reveal body parts in Japanese woodcuts. The bodies themselves are radically flattened, rendered in simplified graphic forms like Tom Wesselmann\u2019s Great American Nudes of the 1960s. Yet ",
