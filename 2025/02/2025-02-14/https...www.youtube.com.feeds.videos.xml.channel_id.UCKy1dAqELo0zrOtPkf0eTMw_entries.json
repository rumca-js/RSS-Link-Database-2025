The issues were so bad that developer FromSoftware may extend the window that the tests will be available. In other news, IGN had an extensive interview with the creators of Okami 2, confirming that yes, this is a direct sequel to the PS2-era Okami, and dropping some other juicy bits of info as well. And finally, Astro Bot continues to win bit at awards shows, taking home some big ones at last night's DICE Awards. And there's more Astro Bot coming, with a new level available now, and more on the way.",
