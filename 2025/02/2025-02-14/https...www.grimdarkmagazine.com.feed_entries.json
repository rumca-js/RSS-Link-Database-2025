        "description": "<p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep is an animated movie released by Netflix on February 11th, 2025. It is a (very) loose adaptation of The Sword of Destiny short story, &#8220;A Little Sacrifice&#8221; by The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski. How loose? Well, &#8220;A Little Sacrifice&#8221; is inspired by The Little Mermaid fairy tale and the sacrifices we make for love. This movie is about the war between the humans of a coastal village and a bunch of mermen, while also setting up another romance for Geralt aside from his traditional one with Yennefer. A loose adaptation doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s bad, though. The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep is up there as one of Netflix\u2019s better adaptations in The Witcher franchise. Whenever Netflix sticks to Sapkowski\u2019s material, it&#8217;s pretty darn good like Season One of the live action show, and, to a lesser extent, Season Three are decent despite some inexplicable choices. It&#8217;s only when Netflix decides to &#8220;improve\u201d Sapkowsk",
