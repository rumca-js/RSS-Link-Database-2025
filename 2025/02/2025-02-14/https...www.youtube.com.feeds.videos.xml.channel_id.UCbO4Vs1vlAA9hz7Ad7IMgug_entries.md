Jordan and I are back as we work our way through the N5 Mission in the Infinity Universe book with the two brand new Armies for the latest edition of Infinity by Corvus Belli!

A Xeno-Archaeologist is contained in stasis in one of three shipping containers scattered through the city. The faction that can secure them will be able to decipher valuable data that could be instrumental in protecting the Human Sphere!
