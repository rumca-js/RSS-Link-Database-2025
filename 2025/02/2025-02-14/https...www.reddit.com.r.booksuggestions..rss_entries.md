I know that science fiction has a lot of unimaginative slop in its genre but I&#39;m really struggling to wade through that for fantasy and find the gems. I feel like most of the fantasy I&#39;ve read feels samey. As example, dwarves. I&#39;ve tried reading a few books that featured dwarves.

I know it‚Äôs a very specific request, but an example of what I‚Äôm looking for is a relationship dynamic between parent and child similar to in the movie Creed. The parent(s) doesn‚Äôt need to be out of the kid‚Äôs life nor does the book need to be about sports.

## Book that depict complicated relationship dynamics similar to novels written by Octavia butler?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And no i don&#39;t mean simply sci fi books because while Octavia butler really is an amazing sci fi writer i think what makes her one of my favorites is her approach to complex relationship dynamics. Rufus and Dana in kindred or the Aliens in liliths brood or shuri &amp; Wyatt in fledgling. The relationship between the protagonist &amp; &quot;antagonist&quot; is never as black &amp; white as it seems. </p> <p>So this is the type of stuff i&#39;m looking for. Power imbalances, coercion, manipulation. Doesn&#39;t matterr, the relationship can be as problematic as possible as long as it&#39;s written in an interesting way. Any genre is appreciated. Also i&#39;m mostly looking for books with black female characters (since there is an abundant of stories like this with white characters) but other woc are also okay.
