This cleanup has led to a bunch of 404 errors and broken linksâ€”both internal and external.</p> <p>My main questions are:</p> <p><strong>1 â€“ What tools to use?</strong></p> <p>Iâ€™ve seen plugins like Broken Link Checker but these are onlly for internal links. For external links Google Search Console seems incomplete whereas tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz look great but are cost-prohibitive for us as a small ecommerce business â€“ it seems these tools are marketed mroe towards agenciy/freelancers.</p> <p><strong>2 â€“ Whatâ€™s the most cost-effective approach?</strong></p> <p>So should we just hire an agency or freelancer with access to these tools or is there something we can use in-house to sort these redirects and internal broken links? Any recommendations for a good tool or method to cover both internal and external broken li

Did some basic SEO optimization and keyword research earlier in my career but never did any extensive SEO or marketing campaigns on my own. Last year I took on a client to fully rebuild their website and then handle SEO as an ongoing service. They are a small HVAC company (started in 2023) but they also service plumbing and electrical. Letâ€™s call them company B. Previously the father of the owner of company B had his own HVAC company (company A) that was dissolved in 2022 as he retired. He passed all his business onto company B in 2023, so I had to convert anything that was already out there from company A to company B (Donâ€™t know if this was a mistake or not but from my research it seemed fine to convert existing profiles as the staff, phone number, and existing customers is pretty much the same).</p> <p>It&#39;s been about 8 months since launching their new
