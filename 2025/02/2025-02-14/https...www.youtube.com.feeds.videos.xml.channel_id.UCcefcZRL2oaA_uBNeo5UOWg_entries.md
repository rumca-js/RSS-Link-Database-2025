Imagine flying from NY to London in just a few hours. That’s the future that Blake Scholl and his team at Boom Supersonic are working towards. Scholl started as a software engineer and pivoted mid career to aviation. Now he’s at the forefront of trying to bring back supersonic travel for all of us. In this episode of Hard Tech, YC’s Jared Friedman visited Scholl in the Mojave desert to find out how someone who didn’t have a background in aerospace engineering was able to build the first ever independently developed supersonic plane.
