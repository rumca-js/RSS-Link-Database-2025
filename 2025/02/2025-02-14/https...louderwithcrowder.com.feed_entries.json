Much attention from the left and the media (but I repeat myself) has been spent on Cousin Elon. I don't think they have the strength to attack Trump anymore. But it's only a matter of time before they realize what a threat Vice President JD Vance is. Exhibit Q is our dude giving a speech and telling a room full of Europeans how much they are a failure of a people and suck at life. Most notably, when it comes to free speech, Europeans don't have it, and the globalists who control them don't believe in it.</p><p>We here at the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website like to apply the Sam Roberts Rules of Wrestling to politics: watch the product, everything counts, and speculate wildly. These rules will apply to most Vance content because he's next in line, and this is a high-profile trip for a VICE president to take ",
