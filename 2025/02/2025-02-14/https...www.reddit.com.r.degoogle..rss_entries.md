<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there! Like a lot of folks, I am dug into Google products like a tick. Partly for sentimental reasons (I was an early Gmail adopter, and I remember the salad days of the internet, pre-capitalist takeover) and partly because of my own executive function challenges.</p> <p>I depend upon Google&#39;s ability to capture dates from Gmail messages and automatically calendarize them. Or link a file from Google Drive to my Google Calendar. Or resurface emails waiting for a response. Etc. All things that allow me to function as a parent and employee, which becomes really challenging (impossible even) without this additional layer of reminders and references.</p> <p>I have reviewed all of the suggested alternatives in the sidebar, but it doesn&#39;t look like there is an alternative all-in-one solution like what I currently have with Google.</p> <p>Help please! Is there anyone who has any suggestions? I want off of Google, but I also don&#39;t want to drown

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As title implies- I have limited tech knowledge, use a MacBook I got for university (trying to transition to that from an old Chromebook I used to rely on for everything), and don’t have lots of money- but I want to degoogle. What is the easiest course of action for someone like me? I’ve browsed through here and it seems some people who post here are helpfully knowledgeable on things like cybersecurity, programming, etc. but I am NOT. What are small changes I can make while I learn? I’ve got multiple gmail accounts linked to things like my student loan accounts, work, etc. and I’m nervous to get off Google and miss important emails. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ornery_Self3419"> /u/Ornery_Self3419 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1ioyiu8/tips_for_degoogling_for_absolute_beginners/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/com
