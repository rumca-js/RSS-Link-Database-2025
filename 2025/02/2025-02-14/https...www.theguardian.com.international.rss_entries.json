For me, it redefined satire for the 20th century. The film was made at a time when America was in crisis. It had just been through the Vietnam war and the civil rights movement. The country was deeply divided and in the midst of a serious identity crisis \u2013 like it is again today. Against this background, and surely in need of a good laugh, Brooks decided to make a \u201ccomedy western\u201d, two film genres that don\u2019t traditionally go together.</p><p>Westerns were white American. Certainly, the earliest examples are propagandist. No other culture mythologises its own creation in such a cinematic way. One tried and tested western blueprint is the tale of the great white saviour bringing the savage land to heel. Blazing Saddles turns this formula on its head. ",
