When he moves quickly, something exciting's going to happen - you can feel it. When he stops, you know that you're going to have to do something clever or dangerous to get him moving again. That's just the way it is.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-review">Read more</a></p>
