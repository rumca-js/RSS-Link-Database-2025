The problem is this isn\u2019t my device. I don\u2019t recognize it. I\u2019ve never seen it before and now whenever it connects my camera disconnects I will then remove the HiCamera and unplug and re-plug in my USB camera, which will work for period time and then the same scenario repeats itself. </p> <p>I have plugged the USB camera back in and hit disable and it says multiple cameras on your network will be affected by this.

But the truth is, your company\u2019s sensitive information could already be on the dark web, being sold or misused. I think a lot of businesses don\u2019t see the risk until it\u2019s too late, and by then, fixing the problem is much harder.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t looked into dark web monitoring yet, waiting until something goes wrong is not the best approach.
