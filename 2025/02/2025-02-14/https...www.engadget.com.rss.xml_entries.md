<p>The recipients of the US government's CHIPS and Science Act awards may not get the amount that they were initially promised. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-prepares-change-us-chips-act-conditions-sources-say-2025-02-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the Trump administration is looking to assess and change the CHIPS Act's current requirements. After that, it's set to renegotiate some of the deals awarded by the Biden administration. It has also indicated a delay in some of the disbursements that are already scheduled, <em>Reuters</em> said. A spokesperson for Taiwan-based GlobalWafers said the company was notified by the program's office that CHIPS Act policies are under review because certain conditions do not align with Trump's executive orders. GlobalWafers is one of the program's awardees that was set to receive $406 million in grants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We joked about "President Musk" shortly after Donald Trump took office, but it turns out that wasn't far from the truth. Over the past few weeks, Elon Musk and his DOGE team wasted no time in trying to dismantle the American administrative state. They've illegally accessed the Treasury Department's federal payment system, pushed for USAID to be dismantled, and have also infiltrated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In this episode, we chat with 404 Media's Jason Koebler about what Musk and his young tech cronies are up to, and how it ties into Silicon Valley's approach to the new Trump administration.</p>

The app disappeared from both Apple and Google’s stores January 19, 2025, as a nationwide ban took effect. Briefly.</p>
<p>What will ultimately happen to TikTok remains unclear. President Trump wants to strike a “deal” that will allow the company to remain operational in the US, including arrangements that would give the US government a stake in the company.</p>
