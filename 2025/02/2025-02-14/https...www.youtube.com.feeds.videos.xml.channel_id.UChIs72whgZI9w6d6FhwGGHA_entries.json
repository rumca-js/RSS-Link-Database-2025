This process will be long and gradual as we build the knowledge required to fully tackle fan comparison charts, eventually leading to BIGGER BAR BETTER, which is all anyone wants in life. For now, we're beginning the exploratory process of publishing experimental results while we study how best to present the data and structure the language describing the results. We're excited for this and have more planned in the coming few weeks! This is the debut of our GamersNexus Fan Tester, and it's starting with case mesh porosity benchmarking. \n\nThis benchmark looks at the impact on airflow and performa",
