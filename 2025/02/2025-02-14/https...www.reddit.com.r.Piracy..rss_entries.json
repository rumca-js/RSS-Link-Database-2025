I&#39;ve looked this up before, and most people either have corrupted drives or failures, etc. I simply deleted a bunch of files off my C: drive and i&#39;d like them back. Was only a couple days ago. There&#39;s nothing wrong with my drives or anything. Can anyone point me to a safe and free file recovery program? I really like wondershare recoverit especially because it will show me the file names instead of &quot;folder&quot; making it easier.

While, I haven\u2019t gotten any abuse complaints, I figure it\u2019s time for me to be safer and change my ways. I also host Jellyfin on the same PC to serve the files I torrent. So for that reason I feel like a VPN would better suit my needs, that way I keep my whole setup, I just add a VPN. However, with a VPS I would be able to seed and download always since I don\u2019t need my PC to be on, but then I would have to have a ton of cloud storage which would be expensive and move everything (jellyfin) over to the VPS (which honestly isn\u2019t a problem, I have time).</p> <p>So my question is if I get a VPN, which one should I get? I hear AirVPN is good. I don\u2019t really care too much about data privacy and all that, I just want my torrenting to be private. I would also like it to be compatible with Windows, Linux, and iOS since I would use it for general use.</p> <p>If I get a VPS, ",

I started the project and initially tried using the <strong>UNIT3D</strong> framework, then later <strong>Gazelle</strong>, but neither worked out well for me. The documentation is lacking, and both communities are quite closed off.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a popular framework currently used by a torrent site? If there is one available, what do people generally use?</p> <p>The purpose of this post is to help me find a solid direction so I can properly start my project.</p> <p>Thanks in advance to everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/runawaydevil\"> /u/runawaydevil </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",

The govt. of India banned a comedy show based off &quot;Kill Tony&quot;, created by Samay Raina and other creators name - India&#39;s Got Latent. One joke about the parents&#39; sex life caused the backlash and whole content has been deleted. I have access to all the 18 episodes which I want to put somewhere for people to access forever including myself and friends. My concerns -</p> <p>1 where can I host it as online playable video with a page dedicated to it ? 2 if not 1, how do I begin to upload the torrent files I created to popular torrent sites and if someone will seed it to help me out. 3 is there someone who can help me publish them to popular piracy websites where tv shows and movies are found ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/12Inderdeep\"> /u/12Inderdeep </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.",
