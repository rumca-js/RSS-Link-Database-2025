Everything points me towards Selenium but all of my attemps are flagged as bot activity. Apparently the elements are dinamically loaded with Java. Is there something obvious I am missing or is just the task complicated? The following script plus some other human activity mimicking lines allow to me scrape for as long as I want, but again, only a couple listings per page so I&#39;m missing the other 28!
