## New Derby manager John Eustace off to awful start with thrashing by QPR

<p>John Eustace was given a painful demonstration of the size of the task he has to save Derby from relegation as his new side slumped to a 4-0 defeat at QPR. Ilias Chair scored twice, with Koki Saito and Ronnie Edwards also on target on a disastrous first day at the office for the new Rams manager.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/13/blackburn-rovers-venkys-blunder-goodbye-john-eustace-championship#:~:text=The%20biggest%20question%20surrounding%20John,Rovers%20was%20indisputably%20a%20success">Eustace raised eyebrows this week by leaving Blackburn</a>, a side challenging for promotion to the Premier League, for one battling against the drop into League One. While Rovers are fifth, Derby’s humbling in west London meant they slipped into the bottom three on goal difference. Eustace certainly knew what was in store for his new side on Friday night, as his final league match with Rovers was a 2-1 defeat at Loftus Road just 10 days earlier.</p> <a href="https:

<p>This utterly idiosyncratic sitcom about young men in smalltown Northern Ireland has hints of This Country – but with a pedalo-based masturbation scene that is unspeakably, brilliantly awful</p><p>Like so many great comedies, Funboys is an idiosyncratic, gently nurtured, quietly horrific thing. The creation of RyanDylan and Rian Lennon, who also play two of its main characters, it began life as a 14-minute film – small but perfectly formed – that premiered at the BBC Two comedy festival two years ago. Now, with cast nicely broadened and content nicely deepened, it has become a series. We follow the three “emotionally unassembled” twentysomethings – Callum Brown (Dylan), Jordan McCafferty (Lennon) and Lorcan Boggin (Lee R James) – whose earnestness belies their self-chosen funboys moniker, as they attempt to assemble and entertain themselves with the sparse resources on offer in the tiny town of Ballymacnoose, Northern Ireland.</p><p>Callum is no longer engaged to his ultra-religiou

A week after he sent them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/08/brighton-chelsea-fa-cup-match-report">tumbling out of the FA Cup</a>, a breathtaking piece of control from the Japan winger to score the opening goal set up another memorable victory for Brighton and piled more pressure on the Chelsea manager.</p><p>Three defeats in their last four matches and with Cole Palmer enduring a frustrating night as he laboured as a false 9, at times Maresca seemed lost on the touchline as he watched his side struggle to find a way back into the game after Yankuba Minteh had made it 2-0 before half-time. His second of the night killed off any hopes of a comeback and it could have turned into a Valentine’s Day massacre had Mitoma, João Pedro or Joël Veltman taken their chances late on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/14/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hull Truck theatre<br></strong>Snappy movement and a Billy Nomates score can’t make up for the lack of emotional range in this portrait of the 18th-century writer</p><p>It was quite a life. Having escaped a violent and heavy-drinking father, Mary Wollstonecraft ploughed a singular path. Avowedly independent and radical in thought, she dazzled and discombobulated a crusty male establishment with her intellect. She turned from governess to author and landed a reporting job in revolutionary France. Among her works, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a foundational feminist text. After that, giving birth to Mary Shelley seems like a postscript.</p><p>Maureen Lennon’s patchwork tribute for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/hull-truck-theatre">Hull Truck</a> and Pilot theatre is a musical collage of fast-paced scenes designed to memorialise a pioneer of sexual equality.

<p>Veteran director Tom Tykwer sends a magical Syrian cleaner into a bohemian yet unhappy family, bringing with her a flashing-light treatment for depression</p><p>Here is a weirdly incoherent and very long aria of semi-comic dismay from white-liberal Europe, and from a Germany whose bold “<em>Wir schaffen das</em>” – or “We can handle this” – Angela Merkel-era attitude to refugees has turned to anxiety. Veteran German director Tom Tykwer has created a heavy-footed magical-realist romp lasting two hours and 40 minutes about a complicated extended family in Berlin whose painful lives are turned around by a magic refugee whose purpose is to salvage their happiness. The film twice uses Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody to provide a jukebox blast of energy – the second time at the very end, worryingly indicating that the classic track is being brought on to save the day because the film is out of ideas.</p><p>Lars Eidinger gives a muscular, unselfconscious performance as Tim, a thoroughly modern

I can’t <em>stand</em> pinotage!”</p><p>This cross between pinot noir and cinsault was developed in South Africa, and it’s the country’s signature grape variety, but its reputation for conjuring notes of burnt rubber and paint has, I fear, tarnished the rest of the country’s wine output.

<p><strong>Nottingham Playhouse<br></strong>Aisling Loftus brings out the unease underlying every scene of Dennis Kelly’s haunting one-woman play</p><p>This production of Dennis Kelly’s one-woman play begins a little like a Netflix special. Barefoot in front of a blank backdrop, our protagonist, played by Aisling Loftus, recounts how she found love in an easyJet queue. Punchlines are delivered with the aplomb of a Palladium standup: Paris is “like Leeds with wide streets”. Insults – “lard-synapsed cockhead” – are as artful as they are crude. A recollection of her “slaggy” years includes a detail so gross-out she instantly repeats it.</p><p>We listen as she builds a dream career as a documentary film-maker, her confidence inspired by her new husband. But even as we’re falling for her candour and chutzpah, Kelly is casting shadows that haunt and lengthen.

<p><strong>Ustinov, Bath<br></strong>In an emphatic production that prowls around the mess of human motive, Peake’s Sister Aloysius doggedly pursues a suspicion of abuse</p><p>John Patrick Shanley’s play first appeared in 2004, the era of known unknowns. His parable about a priest suspected of abuse was, he has said, partly prompted by the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq: war justified by unproven conviction. He depicts a 1960s Bronx school where Sister Aloysius (Maxine Peake), implacable school principal, insists that Father Flynn (Ben Daniels) has behaved inappropriately towards Donald, the school’s sole Black student – yet she lacks evidence.</p><p>Peake maintains a beady eye and ramrod straight spine. Her deep, rustbucket voice of judgment is cut with a squeal of contempt. Daniels leans into his twinkle. His sermons sound like a hand extended to the congregation; his vestment gleams a verdant green. Her starch meets his charisma; dogged belief confronts impassioned

<p>Now is the perfect time to start pruning your fruit bushes and take cuttings to create new plants. Here’s how to do it </p><p></p><p>Last spring, I did some spontaneous pruning of the rampant blackcurrant bush in my veg patch. Instead of putting the cuttings on the compost heap, I placed them in a vase of water because I find the Ribena-like scent of the leaves just delightful. Within a few weeks, the little branches had started to sprout roots and, eventually, each were poised to grow into a bush. These blackcurrant cuttings’ admirable determination to grow can be taken advantage of now, even before the new growing season is under way.</p><p>As winter’s end approaches, and before buds start to break, is a good time for pruning your fruit bushes. This happily coincides with an ideal time to take hardwood cuttings so you can create new plants from your existing plants – an approach that works for blackcurrants, redcurrants, white currants, gooseberries and figs.</p> <a href="https:

That may sound like a grandiose comment, but it’s true. As a trilogy, the original games from 2007-2013 effortlessly plucked the most cerebral ideas from the sci-fi genre and slotted them into a memorable military role-playing game that had players invested from beginning to controversial end.</p><p>Whether you prefer the hopeful, optimistic outlook of Asimov, the dark and reflective commentary of Shelley, the accessible thought experiments of Star Trek, or the arch melodrama of Battlestar Galactica, Mass Effect has it all. The trilogy is as happy grazing on the western-inspired tropes of Star Wars as the “hard” sci-fi of Iain M Banks, blending all

They are stationed on opposite sides – one Russian-run, the other American – so their remote meet-cute develops into a romance across the divide. In Scott Derrickson’s sleek horror thriller, there’s plenty of tracer bullet gunplay and squishy combat with the mysterious creatures that dwell below, but it’s the chemistry of Taylor-Joy and Teller that lifts the piece – a sexy pair who just happen to be highly&nbsp;proficient killers.<em><br>

<p>Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy flirt over an abyss full of creatures in a slickly made but increasingly dumb Apple mockbuster</p><p>On a Valentine’s Day when studios and streamers are steering clear of traditional romance (gory slasher Heart Eyes, goofy action comedy Love Hurts and dating horror The Dead Thing are among this year’s unconventional offerings), Apple TV’s The Gorge feels weirdly traditional in comparison. In any other year a film about two snipers holding guard over an abyss filled with monsters wouldn’t feel like standard date night fare but there are more traditional romcom beats here than one would expect and ultimately want.</p><p>When the film, from The Black Phone and Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson, starts off in genre territory, there’s some low-level fun to be had.

<p>You don’t need to fork out for the OG Chanel version to achieve the classic, chic look – as long as you keep an eye on the details</p><p>The classics are the classics for a reason, and the Little Boxy Jacket is a classic. You know the one I mean. A soft, round-necked jacket that falls in a straight line, lopped off neatly without hugging the waist. The shoulder line is&nbsp;natural, no significant padding. Sleeves are slim and straight. It is loose enough to have a little swing, but it doesn’t flop or trail. This is the jacket equivalent of a classic bob haircut: chic, effortless polish, vaguely French.</p><p>The LBJ never really goes away, but in 2025 it is going to be everywhere.

Their albums had long been absent from streaming platforms, due to disagreements with their old label, Tommy Boy, and issues over samples that needed to be cleared. “It felt like we’d been erased from history,” says Posdnuos. “A whole new generation wasn’t being introduced to our music.” After years of legal wrangling, the first six albums were primed to resurface, promoted by TV appearances and a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London. De La Soul’s long-awaited resurrection was about to happen.</p><p>But Posdnuos was anxious. While Maseo and their longtime producer Prince Paul had been working on the reis
