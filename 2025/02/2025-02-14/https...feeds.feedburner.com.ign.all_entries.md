The announcement of a sequel to Okami came as a surprise to some. While it has been thought that Capcom considered the original game a commercial failure, our recent interview with the project leads suggests Capcom came around on Okami's value a while ago, and has been waiting for the right opportunity ever since.

We recently paid a visit to Osaka, Japan, where we had the pleasure of sitting down to chat with the developers of the upcoming Okami sequel. We've compiled here a rundown of the big ideas from the interview that might be of most interest to Okami fans.

We spent two hours chatting with the three masterminds behind the upcoming sequel to Ōkami: Hideki Kamiya, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, and Kiyohiko Sakata. The trio told us all about their partnership, how the sequel project came to be, and teased a bit of what fans can expect from the long-awaited Ōkami 2.

We still know very, very little about what exactly the newly-announced sequel to Ōkami entails. In a recent interview with project leads, IGN was able to confirm a few crumbs, including that yes, the "Ōkami sequel" is in fact a direct sequel to the events of the first game.

## Ōkami 2 Is Being Made in RE Engine, Confirmed

IGN can now exclusively confirm that's the case, after speaking with several leads on the project.
