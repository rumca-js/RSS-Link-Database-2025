<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since I noticed someone shared a product of their own uploaded as a sellable item on itch.io, I will go beyond my capitalist shame and guilt of exposing my product and show you something I have worked upon. Also something which I am happy about.</p> <p>Introducing to you a REVOLUTIONARY(?) CRT &#39;beeeeeEeeeP&#39; generator. What it does is simply imitate the characteristic &#39;high pitch&#39; noise CRTs made which changed dynamically with flashes and changes in contrast. It even does static-like crackles with more sudden changes on monitor.</p> <p>The idea came along when after years of perfecting my preferred shaders for that good old retro look, I thought to myself, why not also a &#39;pitch&#39; generator? Pun also intended, I am pitching this executable to you.</p> <p>It&#39;s priced at 60, and although it may be excessive, I honestly could not find anything out there which did the same thing as I wanted. So I developed it myself.</p> <p>Grant
