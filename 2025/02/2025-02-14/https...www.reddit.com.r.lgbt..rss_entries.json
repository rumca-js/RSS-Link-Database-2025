I love her to death but recently the things she&#39;s been saying about Chappell have been pissing me off.</p> <p>For some background I have been listening to Chappell since like 2022 before she blew up so there was a moment in time where none of my friends knew who she was. So last year July we were on a road trip and she puts on Chappell which I respond, &quot;omg you know Chappell?&quot; (since no one really knew who she was before, and I was excited) and she got all defensive like &quot;of course I know Chappell, straight people know who Chappell is&quot;. I laughed it off like whatever but soon we were listening to Pink Pony Club and she started telling me that she really relates to the song.
