Ten years ago I saw his photos at the Royal Academy and realised he was also a brilliant photographer; I started reading biographies and checking out the movies I’d missed.

<p>One woman’s quest, told through haunting, harrowing, dreamlike imagery, bears witness to Korea’s traumatic past</p><p>There are books in a writer’s life that gather all their previous themes and explorations in a great act of creative culmination, which both surpasses what had gone before and makes it more clear. We Do Not Part is one of those books. Published last year in Swedish translation, it helped to secure Korean writer Han Kang the 2024 Nobel prize in literature.</p><p>Those who know Han’s work will recognise previous themes and methods here. Like the eponymous character in The Vegetarian, the narrator of We Do Not Part, Kyungha, is fragile and resilient. She finds it hard to sleep or eat, suffers from summer heat and winter cold, and endures terrible physical suffering for reasons that can be hard to understand. Both stories feature video artists, sisterly bonds, and nightmares of murder and bloodshed set in Korean woodlands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books

<p>Jen killed herself after enduring a long wait for the necessary mental health support. Why were so many opportunities missed to save her?</p><p>When Sharren Bridges talks about her daughter’s last summer, in 2021, she chokes up and has to pause. In some ways, it was a good summer. Jen Bridges-Chalkley had a boyfriend and, like most parents of teenagers, Sharren would occasionally act as a taxi driver, taking them down to the local river to swim. “She spent time with her best friends and her godmother,” says Sharren. “And, looking back, she insisted on taking photographs with them and stuff like that.”</p><p>I am at Sharren’s house in Great Bookham in Surrey. We are sitting in the garden with the chickens and a couple of cockerels that haven’t yet learned the correct time of day to do their thing. Sharren works in the office of a homeless shelter and volunteers for Scouts and Guides; before that, she was a teaching assistant. Her mum, Chris – Jen’s grandma – brings out some tea.</p

<p>Both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump’s political careers were shaped by their formative experiences in the 1980s – and, above all, their encounters with Japan</p><p>In 2011, Donald Trump spoke before an audience of about 1,000 in Las Vegas, teasing a prospective, if fanciful, presidential run. Halfway through a rant over Middle East policy and oil prices, he digressed for a moment on trade with Asia: “China, I said the other day – very, very hard to buy anything, outside of China. Certain other countries also, but China’s, you know, the one.</p><p>“And somebody said: ‘What would you do? What could you do?’ So easy. I drop a 25% tax on China. And you know, I said to somebody that it’s really the messenger. The messenger is important. I could have one man say: [falsetto] ‘We’re going to tax you 25%.’ And I could say another: ‘Listen, you motherfuckers, we’re going to tax you 25%!’”</p><p>“We’re a debtor nation.
