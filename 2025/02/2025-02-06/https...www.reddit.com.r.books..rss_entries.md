<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I received Apprentice to the Villain by Hannah Nicole Maehrer as a Christmas present. I had seen it when I was with the person and it looked/sounded really good. I didn’t realize it was the second book of a series until I finished reading 30 some pages and went to add it to my Goodreads tracker.</p> <p>So my question is… can I finish Apprentice without having read the first one or is this one of those where I kinda need to have read the first one?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mobius8321"> /u/Mobius8321 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ijer4r/have_you_read_apprentice_to_the_villain_i_have_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ijer4r/have_you_read_apprentice_to_the_villain_i_have_a/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The way I saw it, the point Vonnegut was trying to make was that a higher purpose <em>does</em> exist but it doesn&#39;t really matter what it is. What does matter is the meaning we make out of something that is most likely absurd and anti-climatic and disappointing after all we build it up to be. Take the alien who is manufactured as the perfect tool who literally disintegrates from the very human emotions of disappointment and heartbreak and compare that to the fact that the point of the entire universe is to deliver a spare part. We shouldn&#39;t waste so much time wondering about what we don&#39;t know because it will most likely pale in comparison to what we do know. I love this idea so much. </p> <p>What are your thoughts? I&#39;d love to know!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/2-0-0-4"> /u/2-0-0-4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ij8epj/just_finished_reading

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for a book tracking site/app with the following specific features:</p> <ul> <li><p>ability to add all books by an author or from a series - having to click add on GR for every single book for say, Stephen King, is so slow going; and when it comes to a series like the Forgotten Realms books, I could be here for hours…</p></li> <li><p>ability to export a CSV of all books in my list</p></li> </ul> <p>That’s it, that’s all I want; don’t care about any other features. I’ve been going through some of the other recommendations in threads here, but figured it might faster/easier to see if anyone knows of something suitable without me having to sign up for 10 different services to try them out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dalek_999"> /u/dalek_999 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ij5rvl/alternative_to_good_reads_with_these_specific/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

He is mentioned in a few other stories but...im sorry I really thought he was going to be much more prominent in the stories. </p> <p>Did I miss something?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Jack Edwards is very charismatic and well spoken and that misled me to thinking i can trust his recommendations. But he really likes normal people and i found that book very difficult to get through. He also like happy place by Emily Henry and i ve read some very negative reviews about that book and generally i find Emily Henry&#39;s books a bit boring. However we both didn&#39;t like book lovers and both found funny story more tolerable so there is that. I believe he also rated wuthering heights as average and i can&#39;t have a very high opinion of anyone who does not see wuthering heights for the master piece it is. Still what he lacks for in book taste, he makes up for in camera presence so i do still watch his videos sometimes. </p> <p>The bookleo and a clockwork reader both recommended books i found dull like the encyclopedia of fairies and other dull books. The bookleo recommends theoretically yours but what i saw on goodreads that it had quit

## When did authors stop giving chapters individual titles?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Way back when, the books I used to read all had chapters with individual titles. </p> <p>Nowadays, the table of contents is Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc. or even just One, Two, Theee.</p> <p>Have you notived that change as well? What could be the reason for this evolution? Do you like it?</p> <p>Personally, I am on the fence. I do enjoy it when a chapter title hints at the upcoming content. I like speculating about what it could mean or how it&#39;ll tie into the bigger story. Though I can also see that seeing titles for upcoming chapters in the table of contents could be a little spoiler-y.</p> <p>On the other hand, Chapter 1, Chapter 2 or One, Two is pretty tidy and neat. Simple and consistent without spoilers. I tend to use this way of chapter titling myself when writing. </p> <p>Another way that I&#39;ve seen is character names. Think Game of Thrones, where we follow several characters, and the chapter title is used to indicate who.</p> <p>I think m

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Empty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline (2019), Darrell Bricker, alongside co-author John Ibbitson, challenges the entrenched belief that humanity’s future will be one of rapid population growth. Instead, he argues that the world may be heading toward a future characterized by demographic decline.</p> <p>From the opening pages, Empty Planet reads like a detective story—a search for clues hidden in decades of census data, economic trends, and sociological studies. Bricker guides the reader through the historical context of population trends, tracing humanity’s explosive growth during the twentieth century, only to reveal that past patterns give way to a new and unsettling reality. The book’s narrative unfolds methodically, combining hard data with engaging anecdotes that bring the numbers to life. I was surprised by his evidence: declining fertility rates in regions once considered the engines of relentless growth, shifts in cultural a
