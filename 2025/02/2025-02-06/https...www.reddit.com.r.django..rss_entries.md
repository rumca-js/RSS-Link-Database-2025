Yeah, me too. That‚Äôs why I&#39;ve built <strong>DjangoMatrix</strong> ‚Äî a community-powered directory to track package compatibility, activity, and alternatives. Think of it like a friendly neighborhood wiki, but for Django packages.</p> <p>And guess what? It could use your help to make it actually useful for all of us.</p> <p><strong>What&#39;s DjangoMatrix all about?</strong><br/> Look, Django packages are amazing‚Ä¶ until they‚Äôre abandoned, or break with the latest Python/Django versions. And I thought we could all use a place where we can see compatibility at a glance.</p> <p><strong>Some interesting things about DjangoMatrix:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Built with Django</strong> (Duhh).

You can have sessions without cookies. Authentication is an inherently stateful process. For example, allauth needs to know if a user is signed in, or
