I am pretty sure the tape was made on my 3000 using <a href=\"http://hugolyppens.com/VBS.html\">VTBS</a>. It was from my old BBS and I would like to restore these files. I don&#39;t have any of the hardware, of course. In this day in age, I wonder if I could just digitize the tape to a video file and then use an emulator to restore the files. I remember the schematic coming out somewhere, and looked it up in the the <a href=\"https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=776\">BBoAH</a> but it was not clear. I wonder if anyone has the software, or the schematic, or any ideas how to restore these files in an emulator. I also have a couple of 500&#39;s that I could use if I could make the adapter again. Here is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmtYrAEVeA\">video</a> I found (not in english) that needs translated, where he makes one, and has a wood case for his amiga!</p> </div><!-- SC",
