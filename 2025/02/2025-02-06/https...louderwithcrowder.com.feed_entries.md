Ever since the recording of him talking about grabbing them by the whoozawhatsit.  Two things have happened since then. The first is Trump has proven to be anti two specific women: Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. The second is that the media and the left (but I repeat myself) have decided guys who say they're girls take precedence over girls who are girls when it comes to competition and prancing around cocks out in the ladies locker room. Trump put an end to that on Wednesday.</p><p>He signed an executive order declaring, get this, girls and women's sports <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/trump-female-sports" target="_blank">will ONLY be before girls and women</a>.
