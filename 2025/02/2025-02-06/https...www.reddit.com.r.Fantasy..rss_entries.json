Where what really nails me personally to a book is the deep politics of the realm(s) showcasing power brokers, agents, changing political landscape, actions having consequences, etc. I&#39;m keen for the action to be there as well, but the political aspect seems a bit thin for my taste in TFL. Imo Sapkowski does a way better job at that in the Witcher series than Abercrombie.</p> <p>So my question: is deep politics ",
