In adulthood, I have come to enjoy books but almost every book I\u2019ve read was in audio form. I want to start reading more but audiobooks are expensive as hell. I want to be able to go to a library or used book store and get a book for cheap but need something that will grab my attention relatively fast to help me ignore the dyslexic dancing letters. Most of my current likes are older books with often painfully slow first few chapters like Jane Austen and Agatha Christie and I fear I will lose interest while physically reading even if I know the meat of the book is fantastic. </p> <p>Things I already like: mystery like Agatha Christie, sci-fi thrillers like Michael Crichton, historical romance like Jane Austen, I also really enjoyed Big Little Lies and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (though this was a bit spicy for me). </p> <p>Things I\u2019m open",

She wants to read to improve her vocab and overall English, but naturally also wants the book to be entertaining or she will end up getting bored and giving up.</p> <p>I&#39;m more of a fantasy reader so I don&#39;t really know which romance books are good. It should be something easy to get into and probably not too <em>heavy</em> on the explicit scenes, so maybe a YA would be good. Oh, and it should be a standalone book\u2014no trilogies or anything for now.</p> <p>After she is done reading it, regardless of if she finishes it or DNF&#39;s it, I&#39;ll probably read it myself so it won&#39;t go to waste. At first I thought about giving her <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, since it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to read as well, but it might too much/complicated for a beginner? Another suggestion I received was <em>Eleanor and Park</em>, is that a good option?</p> <p>Thanks in advance. </p> </di",

USUALLY!! I don&#39;t want to lump all books from one genre together here!). </p> <p>But... I am a sucker for a good romance! When Harry Met Sally is my favorite comfort movie ever! Pride and Prejudice is my favorite comfort book ever! I really want to find a romance that I actually like, that has realistic characters and relationship progression and good dialogue and actual pining and heat.</p> <p>ALSO: Feel free to recommend books with romances in them that aren&#39;t strictly in the romance genre. Always looking for some nice pining...</p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for: - Male lead who&#39;s not like... A grumpy alpha super rich CEO or whatever. Of course, I can make an exception if the book is super good, but I&#39;m looking for less Christ",

I want a book to make me feel like those ao3 hurt/comfort fix\u2019s used to make me feel. I only ask that the couple in question be healthy, like not no weird dubcon stuff or whatever, and that they have a happy ending.

I need recommendations for a paranormal/fantasy romance series where the love interest switches mid series. Like yes a love triangle, but it&#39;s more than that. Let this inspire you: a girl joins a guild and she explores relationships with her teammates/people she meets, but she does choose someone and when she does it&#39;s like WOW, I WAS HOPING SHE&#39;D PICK HIM. Or you think that one guy is going to be the main love interest, but then SWOOP, this other guy is stronger/more powerful/more handsome(lol) and you realize the first guy wasn&#39;t that great. There is no better feeling. And I&#39;m starting to feel desperate. </p> <p>Some examples of this that had me foaming at the mouth: The Obsidian Queen Series by Shari L Tapscott, The Guild Codex: Spellbound by Annette Marie, Fey Spy Academy by C.N. Crawford, and Crave by Tracy Wolff, and ACOTAR! </p> <p>Would also love if it was in 1st PO",

At the start of the story there&#39;s a major betrayal where the ones she trusted the most betrayed her and sell her out to the people that want her dead or are the people that want her dead. She manages to survive the betrayal and wants a way to enact revenge to the people who betrayed her or she wants to find a way to destroy the people who want her dead. If you do find a story just know I don&#39;t care if there&#39;s anything explicit that happens during the read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Late-Engine5717\"> /u/Late-Engine5717 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iipzph/i_need_a_long_read_book_with_multiple_in_its/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i",
