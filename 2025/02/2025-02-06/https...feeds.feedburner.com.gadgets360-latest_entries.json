Their method, CuRVE, allows antibodies to evenly distribute without damaging structure. The approach, combined with stochastic electrotransport, ensures rapid and uniform protein tagging. Tests on various tissues, including mouse and human samples, demonstrated its efficiency. Compared to genetic labeling, CuRVE provided more accurate protein detection, highlighting its potential in biological research. Scientists believe this technique could aid in building a repository of protein expression patterns for medical studies.",

Some scientists suggest an infectious disease, while others believe an increase in shark numbers could explain the rise in beachings. Genetic sequencing is underway to uncover possible pathogens, but for now, the cause remains unknown.",
