Implementing Particle Filters with C++ Ranges - Nahuel Espinosa - CppCon 2024
---

Localization in mobile robotics, critical for autonomous navigation, is a challenging problem often addressed through particle filter algorithms, also known as Monte-Carlo Localization (MCL) estimation. The integration of the ranges library in C++20 introduced powerful new tools to enhance the implementation of these algorithms, further extended in C++23. This talk explores the use of these modern C++ features to develop efficient, composable particle filter algorithms that are well-suited for both 2D and 3D localization tasks.

Attendees can expect an introduction to the basics of particle filters, providing a foundation for understanding their application in robotics. They will then be taken through the design and implementation of a series of essential functions for a particle filter library. These examples will demonstrate how C++23 ranges can be used to refactor traditiona
