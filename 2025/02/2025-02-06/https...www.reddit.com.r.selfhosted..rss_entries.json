I run three of these that I got from the disposed pile at my company as a Proxmox cluster. I have 2 256GB M2 drives in each of them, also from the parts pile. </p> <p>I have a larger PC that I&#39;m running Ubuntu on bare metal with just an 8TB HDD. That runs Plex, Arrs, Nextcloud, Immich, and my son&#39;s Minecraft server. I&#39;m considering decommissioning this one and just adding another prodesk to the cluster with an external storage of some kind for the media. Would a USB connection suffice for the external drive?

Quick googling suggested that I could just restart the container to resolve, but when I did so, the container came back BRAND NEW. It asked me to create a new admin account, and a new home page. I panicked thinking all my info was gone. </p> <p>But I KNOW I saw my wiki pages in the container-connected folders. And, sure enough, if I manually browse to that file location, I can still see my pages and folders in the /data subfolder as .md files. </p> <p>How can I show wikijs that it should be using those pages? I did not change anything in the container mapping, so I thought it would just see everything and come back. Has anyone experienced this behavior before?

I\u2019ve personally been using my own custom code that sends websocket updates to a central server. However, I feel like there is a better approach to this and now that I keep track of almost a 100 different machines it\u2019s not as versatile as it once was and I don\u2019t have the time to update the code. So what is something that I can use on my Linux and optionally(not important) windows machines. I don\u2019t need GUI, it has to be something super lightweight and obviously free and open source.

AWS only asked me for my credit card and that was all. WTH is going on now?
