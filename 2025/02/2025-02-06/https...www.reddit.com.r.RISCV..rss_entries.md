<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read or heard somewhere that Sipeed would be coming out with their own version of the PiKVM OS that runs on the NanoKVM. Obviously same security concerns come up about phoning home and such. While you could lock down that device on your firewall, it doesn&#39;t prevent it from getting into other devices on the LAN. </p> <p>Has anyone heard of any development on these KVMs for the standard image of PiKVM OS? </p> <p>How hard would it be to program the OS to work around this hardware?</p> <p><a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/sipeed-nanokvm-risc-v-stick-on">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/sipeed-nanokvm-risc-v-stick-on</a></p> <p><em>But PiKVM doesn&#39;t run on hereâ€”at least not yet.</em></p> <p><em>And that&#39;s because the NanoKVM uses RISC-V. The CPU architecture is different, and some features aren&#39;t implemented the same as on the Arm CPUs used in the other KVMs.</em></p> <p><em>Sipeed&#39;s working to get PiKVM built fo
