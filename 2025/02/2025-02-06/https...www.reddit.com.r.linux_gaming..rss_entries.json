I like collecting digital games and I just stopped thinking about how mess these things go after some time. There are a lot of different digital libraries where we put our titles on and they are so decentralized. I like having control of my library but it seems to be so hard to have everything in one place like Lutris, where we can put other digital libraries games too. It&#39;s something that needs to be done manually. Sometimes I just want to organize my library aesthetically but it seems to be hard because the solutions are so solid and were thought out with only one purpose. Lutris, for example, is so good for configuring games but not that good aesthetically. Going deeper when playing a game I like to get and maintain some relevant information about the game, such as wikis, mods, adjusts, util links for videos, and these kinds of things.

If the 4090 is a niche product that would mean every AMD GPU on the market is even more niche. Like seriously, how in the hell did the 4090 outsell the RX6600.</p> <p>This really didn&#39;t strike me until last week when I was waiting in a Microcenter line to buy a 5090 and there were 200 people in the line the day before the things went on sale. And most of those people it seemed were there to buy 5090s, not 5080s. But sure, a lot scalping no doubt.</p> <p>The economics of GPUs are completely different as they&#39;ve moved beyond gaming. But even in gaming pure performance is more valuable than performance per dollar as more people seem to be willing to spend for speed more than ever.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
