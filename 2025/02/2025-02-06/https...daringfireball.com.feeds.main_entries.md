<p>Dave Nanian, <a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/happy_new_fix/">last week at the Shirt Pocket blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just a quick post: macOS 15.3 is now out, and with it, a fix for
the broken replicator. As such, macOS copying will work again with
Erase, Then Copy backups. No update to SuperDuper is necessary
(but feel free to install our v3.10 Beta 2, below). [...]</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience as we waited for the fix from Apple. I
know I’m relieved that I (hopefully) will no longer be bombarded
with support because of it!</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/macos-15-2-bootable-backup-bug">You may recall</a> that this was a bug introduced in MacOS 15.2, which prevented Shirt Pocket’s excellent <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/superduper">long-standing</a> utility <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a> from making a bootable clone of your startup drive.
