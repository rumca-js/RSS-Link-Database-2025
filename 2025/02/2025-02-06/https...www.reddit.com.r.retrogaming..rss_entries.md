<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can anybody here suggest good coffee table material for retro (and millenial) games? All I have is Hyrule Historia, which was kinda disappointing, because most content is dedicated to Skyward Sword instead of the classics, and also a Capcom character guide, which was so-so. I heard the early Nintendo strategy guides were nicely designed. In the mid 2000s there was a book called Resident Evil Archives with tons of official background info on the PS1 games, but sadly that&#39;s really expensive to get these days. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kainzkai"> /u/kainzkai </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ijf5ti/best_collectors_books_strategy_guides_art_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ijf5ti/best_collectors_books_strategy_guides_art_books/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just got a TrimUI Brick in the other day and am working through getting some ROMs installed. I already got all my favorites from my childhood consoles (GBA, GBC, NDS, PS1) but am also wanting to dip my toes into NES, SNES, &amp; Sega Genesis... I just have NO IDEA where to start on which games to pick on those consoles as they&#39;re are SO MANY OPTIONS and I&#39;m not wanting to dump a million games on there due to having video game ADHD which would cause me never to be able to choose. It&#39;s difficult to pick any of my favorites when I&#39;ve never played those systems before. Any recommendations? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Coopbacca"> /u/Coopbacca </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1iitmjv/need_some_help_choosing_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1iitmjv/need_some_help_choosing_games/">[co
