<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay now I know how this sounds….</p> <p>I PROMISE IM NOT TRYING YO DO ANYTHING BAD</p> <p>I have an old email I made in high school. There’s a social media account attached to it. I have access to the social media account so that’s not this issue. </p> <p>What I don’t have access to is the actual mail aspect for the email.</p> <p>I’ve tried resetting the password, but the password for the email itself is not the same to the password to the social media platform and the account is linked to an old phone number that I no longer have access to.</p> <p>So essentially, I just can’t get back into the email. And I can’t try to change the password either because that either sends the confirmation email to the mail that I don’t have access to or it sends the confirmation code to the phone number I don’t have.</p> <p>This sounds sketchy AF I know, but you can look at all the things that the email is linked to, it’s literally just a social media account. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometimes when it comes to solve CTF or Something like that. There always something that stop me and after too much thinking i use walkthroughs on youtube But then after i finish the machine i feel that i cheated or i didn&#39;t get any experience because i didn&#39;t solve it by myself. Is it considering as cheating or as a part of my learning? (I solved 12. 3 of them by myself)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Felix_455-788"> /u/Felix_455-788 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1iivb3n/i_feel_bad_when_i_watch_walkthroughs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1iivb3n/i_feel_bad_when_i_watch_walkthroughs/">[comments]</a></span>
