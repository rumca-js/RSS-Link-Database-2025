Allegedly. But looking at the spec sheet, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking it was a souped-up gaming rig. It\u2019s packing an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H CPU, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, a 4K screen, and a whopping 64GB of RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, you\u2019d pay $2,500 for this beast. Today, CDW is <a href=\"https://www.cdw.com/product/msi-creator-ai-studio-16-4k-mini-led-120hz-creator-laptop-intel-core-ultr/7814651\">selling it for $1,698.09</a>. That\u2019s a whopping $800 off. A bargain for these specs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI Creator 16 AI Studio isn\u2019t technically a gaming laptop. It\u2019s designed for media production. But the only real difference is that the RTX 4080 GPU is limited to \u201cjust\u201d 105 TDP, so it\u2019ll still whoop up on (technical term) just about anything in its price range, even with that 4K mini-LED screen showing off all the polygons it",
