<p>The MSI Creator 16 is a laptop. Allegedly. But looking at the spec sheet, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was a souped-up gaming rig. It’s packing an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H CPU, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU, a 4K screen, and a whopping 64GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Normally, you’d pay $2,500 for this beast. Today, CDW is <a href="https://www.cdw.com/product/msi-creator-ai-studio-16-4k-mini-led-120hz-creator-laptop-intel-core-ultr/7814651">selling it for $1,698.09</a>. That’s a whopping $800 off. A bargain for these specs.</p>



<p>The MSI Creator 16 AI Studio isn’t technically a gaming laptop. It’s designed for media production. But the only real difference is that the RTX 4080 GPU is limited to “just” 105 TDP, so it’ll still whoop up on (technical term) just about anything in its price range, even with that 4K mini-LED screen showing off all the polygons it

<p>Ready to turn your house into a smart home? Replacing your dumb bulbs with smart ones is perhaps the easiest way to start. Many smart bulbs can be screwed into existing light sockets, and they can be controlled remotely, put on schedules, change colors, and more. </p>



<p>If you’re feeling more ambitious, you can venture into smart string lights, light strips, wall and ceiling fixtures, smart lamps, and even smart lighting for the yard or other outdoor areas. </p>



<p>Our guide to the best smart lighting can help you navigate the thicket of options, from the various smart light manufacturers (like Philips Hue, LIFX, Nanoleaf, and Wyze) to the connectivity standards (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Matter). We’ll also let you know which voice assistants (like Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google Assistant) work with which lights. </p>

<p>Google has now given its Gemini app access to a new AI model called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.google/feed/gemini-app-experimental-models/">announcement blog post</a>, the company says this model is currently “ranked as the world’s best model” and is available at no cost. The model is designed to answer complex questions by breaking them down into smaller steps and explaining its assumptions and reasoning, which should lead to more accurate and reliable answers.</p>



<p>At the same time, Google is also releasing a version of 2.0 Flash Thinking that can interact with other Google apps, such as YouTube, Search, and Maps. The goal is for Gemini to further incorporate these apps to bolster its reasoning capabilities to help you do more.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Google is rolling out an experimental

<p>Bill Gates was once the embodiment of the computer industry. Though the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft retired over a decade ago to pursue full-time philanthropy, people still listen when he talks — and in a recent interview, he talked about Intel.</p>



<p>Intel is having a rough time of late. The chipmaker’s stock is practically in freefall. It’s had high-profile failures for its most powerful CPUs, and rivals AMD and especially Nvidia are kicking its silicon butt in the AI arms race. In December, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2542377/intel-ceo-steps-down-after-a-disastrous-2024.html">the company’s CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down</a> after working for Intel on-and-off for decades. Yeah, it’s bad.</p>



<p>Intel is also one of Microsoft’s most important partners, so it’s no surprise that the company’s woes came up <a href="https://apne

<p>Last week’s optional Windows 11 update, known as patch KB5050094, was nice because it fixed several issues, including <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2591942/optional-windows-11-update-fixes-usb-audio-bugs-among-others.html">broken USB audio playback</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593590/windows-11s-auto-hdr-works-again-but-you-have-to-manually-update-first.html">Auto HDR for gaming</a>.</p>

<p>Qualcomm said Wednesday that it has made strong progress against its goals for Snapdragon PCs, and that its ongoing litigation with Arm had wrapped up.</p>



<p>Specifically, according to Circana — which owns the NPD Group — Qualcomm captured more than a 10 percent share of all of the Windows laptops sold in the United States priced higher than $800, Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, told investors. </p>



<p>Though Qualcomm will have a ways to go to usurp AMD and Intel from the laptop market, it’s a good start. Amon said that more than 80 PC designs using the Snapdragon X Elite or one of its derivatives were either in production or development, and the company is targeting more than 100 designs to be commercialized through 2026.</p>



<p>“We look forward to PCs powered by Snapdragon X from leading OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, and
