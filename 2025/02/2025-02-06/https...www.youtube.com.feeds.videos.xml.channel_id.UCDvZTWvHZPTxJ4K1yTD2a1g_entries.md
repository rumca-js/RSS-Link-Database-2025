In this episode of Backlog Busters, we meet Jon who has been collecting warhammer and warmachine miniatures for 26 years and unfortunately - the last couple of years have not had much time painting and far too much time collecting. He needs help, and it's urgent, to get started with painting again to make his backlog smaller!
