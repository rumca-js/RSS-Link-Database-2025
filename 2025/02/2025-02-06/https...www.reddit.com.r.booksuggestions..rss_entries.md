I want to be able to go to a library or used book store and get a book for cheap but need something that will grab my attention relatively fast to help me ignore the dyslexic dancing letters.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently discovered that one of the things I value most in a story is a fascinating, wildly original setting -- the more thoroughly explored and further-removed from reality the better. Preferably, I&#39;d like for a large focus of the story to be on exploring and learning more about the world rather than it just being a background element -- I love when the setting of a story can be described as a character unto itself. </p> <p>I enjoy both sci-fi and fantasy, but settings that use a healthy blend of both get <strong>big</strong> bonus points. My current gold standards are the narrative podcasts Midst and UNEND, set in the same science-fantasy space western universe with an <em>extremely</em> out-there cosmology, and the game Caves of Qud, set in an incomprehensibly far-future version of Earth where civilization has risen and fallen multiple times, and the technologies of empires past blend right in with psionic powers and fantastical monst

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m looking for a book to give to my sister (F19). She wants to read to improve her vocab and overall English, but naturally also wants the book to be entertaining or she will end up getting bored and giving up.</p> <p>I&#39;m more of a fantasy reader so I don&#39;t really know which romance books are good. It should be something easy to get into and probably not too <em>heavy</em> on the explicit scenes, so maybe a YA would be good. Oh, and it should be a standalone book—no trilogies or anything for now.</p> <p>After she is done reading it, regardless of if she finishes it or DNF&#39;s it, I&#39;ll probably read it myself so it won&#39;t go to waste. At first I thought about giving her <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, since it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to read as well, but it might too much/complicated for a beginner? Another suggestion I received was <em>Eleanor and Park</em>, is that a good option?</p> <p>Thanks in advance. </p> </di

Pride and Prejudice is my favorite comfort book ever! I really want to find a romance that I actually like, that has realistic characters and relationship progression and good dialogue and actual pining and heat.</p> <p>ALSO: Feel free to recommend books with romances in them that aren&#39;t strictly in the romance genre. Always looking for some nice pining...</p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for: - Male lead who&#39;s not like... A grumpy alpha super rich CEO or whatever. Of course, I can make an exception if the book is super good, but I&#39;m looking for less Christ

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This might be too niche, but I&#39;m gonna give it a go!! I need recommendations for a paranormal/fantasy romance series where the love interest switches mid series. Like yes a love triangle, but it&#39;s more than that. Let this inspire you: a girl joins a guild and she explores relationships with her teammates/people she meets, but she does choose someone and when she does it&#39;s like WOW, I WAS HOPING SHE&#39;D PICK HIM. Or you think that one guy is going to be the main love interest, but then SWOOP, this other guy is stronger/more powerful/more handsome(lol) and you realize the first guy wasn&#39;t that great. There is no better feeling. And I&#39;m starting to feel desperate. </p> <p>Some examples of this that had me foaming at the mouth: The Obsidian Queen Series by Shari L Tapscott, The Guild Codex: Spellbound by Annette Marie, Fey Spy Academy by C.N. Crawford, and Crave by Tracy Wolff, and ACOTAR! </p> <p>Would also love if it was in 1st PO

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, One of my friends recently asked for my help getting into reading. This is obviously a huge deal, and I want to find something that will make her want to continue. She asked for a fantasy princess x knight book. Since she is new to reading I&#39;d prefer minimal spice. I&#39;m open to books kind of like this as well. I know for sure that the romance plotline should be a major part of the story. I&#39;m not super into fantasy so have been struggling thinking of a rec, anything you reccomended helps! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Electronic_Local_753"> /u/Electronic_Local_753 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iiqkzd/princessxknight_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iiqkzd/princessxknight_book/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m in the mood to read trashy romance. I’d really love to read ones where they meet on a plane but am open to reading anything with inconvenient or dramatic meetings for the romantic leads. I don’t like bully romance so nothing with that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/like_the_award"> /u/like_the_award </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iiqkdm/books_with_mates_meeting_in_inconvenient_ways/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iiqkdm/books_with_mates_meeting_in_inconvenient_ways/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a book with a female protagonist that has a dark secret, like a power or hidden heritage that could cause her to get killed. At the start of the story there&#39;s a major betrayal where the ones she trusted the most betrayed her and sell her out to the people that want her dead or are the people that want her dead. She manages to survive the betrayal and wants a way to enact revenge to the people who betrayed her or she wants to find a way to destroy the people who want her dead. If you do find a story just know I don&#39;t care if there&#39;s anything explicit that happens during the read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Late-Engine5717"> /u/Late-Engine5717 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iipzph/i_need_a_long_read_book_with_multiple_in_its/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i
