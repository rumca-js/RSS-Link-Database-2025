In this snippet from Podcast Beyond 882, Rumor has it, Sony’s doing a State of Play next week, which seems more likely than not based on the timing of previous years’ presentations, so we run down a list of predictions of what we expect to see. Ghost of Yotei seems like a safe bet, as does Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Live-service is a bit of a touchy subject for PlayStation at the moment, but Bungie’s Marathon and Haven Interactive’s Fairgame$ are both in the works the last we heard. On the third-party front, Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta Triange: Snake Eater Remake has been aligning itself with Sony since the jump, and we expected it’d drop last fall, but there’s still no release date. Midnight Walk is that creeply-looking platformer that’s coming to PS5 and PSVR2 alike, and it’s expected sometime this year. And of course, there are a number of soulslike and soulslike-lookalikes including Where Winds Meet, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Hell is Us, Phantom Blade Zero, Ballad of Antara an

No matter how hard you try, you can’t break up with your past. 
 
This Valentine’s Day, Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan (Everything Everywhere All at Once, Loki) rockets into his first major leading man role as an unlikely hero, a seemingly mild-mannered realtor with a dark secret that he is desperate to leave behind. Spoiler alert: He won’t. 
 
Quan stars as Marvin Gable, a realtor working the Milwaukee suburbs, where ‘For Sale’ signs bloom. Gable receives a crimson envelope from Rose (Oscar winner Ariana DeBose; West Side Story, Argylle), a former partner-in-crime that he had left for dead. She’s not happy. 
 
Now, Marvin is thrust back into a world of ruthless hitmen, filled with double-crosses and open houses turned into deadly warzones. With his brother Knuckles (Daniel Wu; Tomb Raider, Warcraft), a volatile crime lord, hunting him, Marvin must confront the choices that haunt him and the history he never truly buried.
