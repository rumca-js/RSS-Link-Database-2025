<p>Ange Postecoglou mused recently about hope and the inherent futility of it with the way that things have gone for Tottenham this season. Every time the manager had seen “light at the end of the tunnel”, he said, it had “usually been an oncoming train”.</p><p>It was an appropriate way to describe Liverpool, who did not so much roll into the Carabao Cup final, their first such showpiece under Arne Slot, as steamroll their way there. They refused to countenance any other outcome and they utterly flattened Spurs. Who can stop Liverpool this season? It is the question on everybody’s lips as they look down from the summit of the Premier League and eye glory in the Champions League and FA Cup, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/06/liverpool-tottenham-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Meet-cute at Mansfield Park: can modern covers turn young readers on to Jane Austen?

<p>New editions of her novels are aimed squarely at the BookTok demographic – but will this make these classics appeal to fans of “spicy” romance?</p><p>What will get young people reading classic literature? Better blurbs? Changes in the school curriculum? Flashy new biographies of dead authors? Or might it be pastel pink covers emblazoned with characters that look as if they just got back from Comic-Con?</p><p>Publisher Penguin Random House (PRH) is trying its luck with the latter: its youth imprint, Puffin, has announced a series of new editions of Jane Austen novels pitched at young romance readers. Although Austen’s stories will remain the same, the covers of these editions feature cartoonish illustrations of the characters, and are being marketed as “full of meet-cutes, missed connections and drama”. This description makes it sound as if these classic works are akin to the kind of contemporary romance novels that are hugely popular on TikTok with teenagers and young adults.</p>

<p>Ke Huy Quan’s first live-action film since his Oscar win recycles its predecessor’s hit formula into a gloatingly gory mob romcom co-starring Ariana DeBose </p><p>In his first live-action film appearance since winning an Oscar for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-owes-its-smashing-oscars-victory-to-its-amazing-resonance">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>, comeback kid Ke Huy Quan has chosen a movie that recycles the earlier one’s hit formula. Martial arts action plays out incongruously in quotidian locations; life lessons are combined with close-quarter combat. One difference is Love Hurts’s gloating reliance on gore: a hand is impaled with a knife, a pen is buried in a man’s eyeball, teeth stick to the duct tape ripped from a hostage’s mouth. It all rather puts the “ick” in karate kick.</p><p>Quan plays Marvin Gable, a realtor whose chirpiness conceals his past as a hitman for his crime-boss brother Knuckles (Daniel Wu).

<p>The rest of the world will look on in envy on Sunday as the US blends sport and music in a fashion no one else can match</p><p>If US high school romcoms have taught us anything, it’s that jocks don’t have anything in common with those who play band. Nor do they, typically, hang with the brooders, the sensitive souls who write waspish poetry and listen to indie music. And yet here we are: another Super Bowl, another year of romance. It shouldn’t work, not where so many other relationships have faltered. But this one is true love.</p><p>We’re not talking about Travis and Taylor, but NFL and the half-time show. This Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles, we once again bear witness to a perfect American marriage: the country’s biggest sporting event coupled with a live music gig so valuable to its megastar performers that they undertake it for free.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/06/the-greatest-sport-pop-relationship-not-taylor-a

<p><strong>Omnibus theatre, London</strong> <br>Natalia Lizorkina’s play traces a mother’s anguish when she is told her son ‘has not been captured’ in a dystopia where words mean their opposite</p><p>Alya, a Russian mother, worries about her son, Vanya, who has been “sent to the peace”. From the frontline, she receives a phone call to say that he “has not been captured”. She passes a beggar on the street who stresses that she doesn’t need money as she and her children are happy and well-nourished.</p><p>Viewers soon realise that this Russia is an inverted world in which words and statements mean their opposite and the truth can only be surmised by reversing lies – the sort of place where a president might call invasion of a sovereign nation “a special military operation”. By the time a judge tells Alya that she has “done nothing wrong” and a doctor sardonically reassures her that she is “not dying”, there is a chill in an audience that has learned this warped talk.</p> <a href="https

<p>A green belt circling the capital of Burkina Faso is preparing the country for the climate crisis</p><p>As far as the eye can see is a hodge-podge of trees, vegetable plots and water tanks. Up close it may look like a gigantic allotment, but this unusual project actually stretches for 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres), a green belt that now completely rings the city of Ouagadougou.</p><p>The green belt began life many years ago in the 1970s, with the aim of building a protective wall against the encroaching desert that lies beyond the greenery, just a few steps away. In Burkina Faso, one-third of the territory – about 9 million hectares of productive land – is degraded, with an estimated average degradation rate of 360,000 hectares per year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “Burkina Faso is not a climatically favoured country, but the drought of the 1980s exacerbated the problem, leading to significant population movements toward less degraded areas,” explains

<p>New format was supposed to send Super League teams to lower-league grounds but things haven’t quite gone to plan</p><p>It is officially the start of the new Super League season this weekend, but not quite as you may remember it.

## The idea of ‘welfare’ has lost all meaning. Just look at the cruel state of women’s prisons | Zoe Williams

<p>A new report says there’s a ‘basic lack of decency’ in England’s jails. It’s a motif repeated across a nation stripped to the bone</p><p>One of the fundamentals of modern jail craft is the idea that it’s hard to convince prisoners that you care about their welfare if they’re living in squalid conditions. This has been understood for years, with fluctuating amounts of buy-in from politicians about how important it was to offender management that inmates felt cared about.</p><p>Self-harm, meanwhile, has long been an issue of concern. I remember, in the 1990s and 2000s, detailed conversations with prison psychologists<strong> </strong>about why women’s prisons had disproportionate amounts of it: one idea, which I always found the most convincing, was that women, where they had children, were almost always the main carer, so were in a state of constant anxiety about who was looking after them. Another theory was that psychological interventions such as anger management courses had bee

Four years ago, his ever-escalating success seemed assured: his brilliant performance as Ritchie, the lead character in Channel 4’s lockdown hit It’s a Sin, had been garlanded with award nominations; his band Years and Years, who had scored a string of huge hits in the 2010s, had been repurposed as his solo vehicle; and he was a star turn at the 2021 Brit awards, reclining on Elton John’s piano and singing the Pet Shop Boys song that gave the series its name, surrounded by drag queens and queer clubland luminaries.</p><p>But the subsequent Years and Years album, Night Call, met with a muted response – it wasn’t a flop, but nor was it anything like as successful as its two predecesso

It’s an authorised guide that stops at the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin II, in 1969. Fans may be disappointed that the film quits before Stairway to Heaven.

<p>A new show celebrates the pioneering, polemical artist who inspired a generation of Black British creatives – and whose works are as relevant today as they’ve ever been</p><p>For many reasons, 1981 stands as a landmark year in Black British history. That January, the New Cross Fire claimed the lives of 13 young Black people. Amid widespread suspicion that the fire had been a targeted attack by violent racists, the police concluded otherwise after a lacklustre investigation. In April came the Brixton uprising, which resulted in 279 injuries to police and £7.5m worth of damage to the area’s buildings and vehicles. While the subsequent Scarman Report acknowledged some of the hardships facing people of colour, it emphatically denied the existence of institutional racism in Britain – no surprise perhaps given Thatcher had swept to victory a couple of years previously on the back of a wave of anti-immigration sentiment.</p><p>It was against this tumultuous backdrop that Donald Rodney –

There was the jumbie-owl, a ghost bird or harbinger of death, who flew between the world of spirits and the living, and the soucouyant, an elderly woman who wreaks havoc as a flying nocturnal fireball-vampire. And there were the real-world devils, painted blue and red, molasses or tar-smeared, lashing whips that recalled plantation-owner brutality, encountered at carnival. “They were part of my consciousness and lived as a visceral reality from a tender age,” he says today.</p><p>The artist’s major touring survey, Carnivalesque, conjures these figures in paintings using lush brushwork in heated colours, dire

<ul><li>Updates from the opening day of the match in Galle</li><li>Play starts at 10am local/3.30pm AEDT</li><li>Any thoughts? <a href="mailto:james.wallace.casual@theguardian.com">Email James</a></li></ul><p>Geoff Lemon has prepared a scene setter for your delectation:</p><p>So the second Test depends on Sri Lanka showing up this time and it also depends on what the ground staff deliver. At a guess that is more likely to be a pitch that spins from day one, given the new track already looked ready to play on four days out from the start. It’s not that Sri Lanka showed any aptitude against Australia’s spin, but at least a severely turning track would level out any advantage from the toss. Australia have prepared for those conditions too and, with the run-fest banked, it would be much more entertaining and instructive to see how they combat difficulty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/feb/06/australia-vs-sri-lanka-live-cricket-scores-second-test-day-one-blog-gal

<p>Japanese practice Sanaa’s slender, stripped-back buildings boast walls that are just 16mm thick and concrete canopies that look as if they could float away</p><p>It is not often as an architecture critic that you find yourself referring to the dimensions of a building in millimetres. But then few buildings are as slender, stripped back and meticulously honed as those designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, founders of the Japanese practice Sanaa, who have been announced as this year’s recipients of the RIBA royal gold medal for architecture.</p><p>They have built <a href="https://architecture-tokyo.com/2017/06/16/2003-house-in-a-plum-grove-kazuyo-sejima/">a house in Tokyo</a> with the delicacy of a cardboard model, where the internal walls are just 16mm thick.
