What does matter is the meaning we make out of something that is most likely absurd and anti-climatic and disappointing after all we build it up to be. Take the alien who is manufactured as the perfect tool who literally disintegrates from the very human emotions of disappointment and heartbreak and compare that to the fact that the point of the entire universe is to deliver a spare part. We shouldn&#39;t waste so much time wondering about what we don&#39;t know because it will most likely pale in comparison to what we do know. I love this idea so much. </p> <p>What are your thoughts?

However we both didn&#39;t like book lovers and both found funny story more tolerable so there is that. I believe he also rated wuthering heights as average and i can&#39;t have a very high opinion of anyone who does not see wuthering heights for the master piece it is.
