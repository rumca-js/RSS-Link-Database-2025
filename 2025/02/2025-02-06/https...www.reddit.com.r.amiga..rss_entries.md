<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Happy emulator until I put a USB stick into the port below the SD card slot. Since then, Pi68 stops after successful BUP. Only other hint - an initial floppy drive click that I don’t think was there when working properly. All thoughts appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished-Roof970"> /u/Accomplished-Roof970 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ijfnrp/pistorm1200_stops_after_successful_bup_test/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ijfnrp/pistorm1200_stops_after_successful_bup_test/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just found one of my old backups...on a VHS tape. I am pretty sure the tape was made on my 3000 using <a href="http://hugolyppens.com/VBS.html">VTBS</a>. It was from my old BBS and I would like to restore these files. I don&#39;t have any of the hardware, of course. In this day in age, I wonder if I could just digitize the tape to a video file and then use an emulator to restore the files. I remember the schematic coming out somewhere, and looked it up in the the <a href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=776">BBoAH</a> but it was not clear. I wonder if anyone has the software, or the schematic, or any ideas how to restore these files in an emulator. I also have a couple of 500&#39;s that I could use if I could make the adapter again. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmtYrAEVeA">video</a> I found (not in english) that needs translated, where he makes one, and has a wood case for his amiga!</p> </div><!-- SC

## Writing adf disk images to real floppy disks using a usb floppy drive?.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Title. I would be happy to get a usb floppy drive for this purpose and I also considered a greaseweasel but I noticed it connects to a standard pc disk drive which I do not have. Gotek also does not interest me and never has so please don&#39;t bring that up.

## Planning to sell an Amiga 1200 – Safe to Power On After 20+ Years?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking to sell my Amiga 1200, which has been stored in a plastic box for 20–30 years. The last time I powered it on was 10–15 years ago. I know these machines can have capacitor leakage issues, but I’ve never inspected mine, so I don’t know the condition of the internal components. I&#39;m the original owner, bought it new in the 90s.</p> <p>Would it be safe to briefly power it on to test if it works, or could that create a problem? Would selling it as-is, untested be the better option? I don’t plan to recap it myself, but I assume an enthusiast would still find value in it. </p> <p>Looking for opinions from those with experience. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/elitwin"> /u/elitwin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ij4wsj/planning_to_sell_an_amiga_1200_safe_to_power_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1
