<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can someone recommend an RSS reader that works instantly from an OPML file?</p> <p>My use case is that I want users of <a href="https://www.zacusca.net">https://www.zacusca.net</a> to see a before and after, instantly (hopefully including non-RSS users).</p> <p>Basically every service I can see requires that you sign up to import your OPML. I just want people to be able to click a link and immediately see how some set of feeds looks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cachao-on-Reddit"> /u/Cachao-on-Reddit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iip4eb/instant_rss_reader_from_opml/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iip4eb/instant_rss_reader_from_opml/">[comments]</a></span>
