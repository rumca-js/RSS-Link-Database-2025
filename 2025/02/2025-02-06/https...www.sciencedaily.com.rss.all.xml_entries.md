Mantis shrimp withstand repeated high-impact forces without structural damage. Researchers discovered the shrimp's clubs feature a protective pattern that controls how stress waves travel through its body. The patterns resemble herringbone and twisted, corkscrew arrangements. Insights from this discovery could inspire advanced protective materials for reducing blast-related injuries.

People's ability to interpret emotions or focus on performing a task is reduced by short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution, potentially making everyday activities, such as the weekly supermarket shop, more challenging.

## The two proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease affect brain circuits differently

A research team has discovered that the two key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's -- tau protein and beta-amyloid -- affect brain circuits in distinct yet synergistic ways, particularly those linked to memory and emotions. The study, using a new animal model of Alzheimer's disease, suggests a potential breakthrough in treatment strategies. Current therapies mainly focus on blocking just one of the toxic proteins associated with the disease, but this discovery could pave the way for more comprehensive approaches.

## New screening device shows promise for early lung cancer detection

Scientists have created a new low-cost, fast response sensor to detect lung cancer biomarkers, paving the way for the development of screening devices to spot the disease even before symptoms occur. Similar in design to glucose monitoring devices, the sensor provides results from a blood sample in just 40 minutes. The technology has the potential to be used by clinicians to both identify patients at higher risk of lung cancer, and tailor treatments for those already diagnosed in a 'precision medicine' approach.

## Mercury content in tuna can be reduced with new packaging solution

Fish is a high-quality source of protein, containing omega-3 fatty acids and many other beneficial nutrients. However, the accumulation of toxic mercury also makes fish consumption a concern, of which tuna is particularly susceptible. Researchers have now come up with a novel approach to packaging canned tuna infused in the water-based solution of amino acid cysteine. It was shown to remove up to 35 percent of the accumulated mercury in canned tuna, significantly reducing human exposure to mercury via food.

## Rethinking energy demand can foster sustainable development and reduce emissions from buildings and transport

In a new study, scientists show that a mix of policy measures, including both technological solutions and behavioral changes, can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy use in buildings and transport.

## Whale poop contains iron that may have helped fertilize past oceans

A recent theory proposes that whales weren't just predators in the ocean environment: Nutrients that whales excreted may have provided a key fertilizer to these marine ecosystems. Oceanographers now find that whale excrement contains significant amounts of iron, a vital element that is often scarce in ocean ecosystems, and nontoxic forms of copper, another essential nutrient that in some forms can harm life.

## InsectNet technology identifies insects around the world and around the farm

A new study of breast cancer survivors has found this psychosocial challenge impacts almost every important domain of their lives -- the emotional, behavioral, cognitive, relational and professional. A larger number of domains was affected, and they were affected more frequently in those with greater fear of recurrence. The majority of study participants indicated that they sought senses of purpose, belonging, control and connection with others.
