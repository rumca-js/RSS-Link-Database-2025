<p>Any business that relies on selling electronics to Americans is having a bit of a crisis at the moment. Less than two weeks into the new Trump administration, there’s a new 10 percent tariff on goods from China — which is most consumer goods, period — and it’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2521477/trump-tariffs-could-cost-tech-consumers-bigly.html">set to shoot prices through the roof</a>. ASRock, manufacturer of motherboards and other PC hardware, is feeling the pinch. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/asrock-to-shift-manufacturing-in-response-to-trumps-china-tariffs">The company told PCMag</a> that it “need[s] some time to transfer the manufacturing to other countries.” Shipments from China via the United States Postal Service were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/usps-resume-accepting-china-shipments-after-

<p>It’s been well more than a year since Amazon gave us a glimpse of a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2546840/alexas-big-ai-makeover-8-burning-questions-answered.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2546840/alexas-big-ai-makeover-8-burning-questions-answered.html">revamped Alexa, complete with an AI overhaul</a> under the hood. Now there are signs that the AI-powered Alexa is almost ready for prime time. </p>



<p>Journalists (including me) awoke this morning to invitations from Amazon for a “Devices and Services” event hosted by Panos Panay, the ex-Microsoft exec who’s <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2073531/microsoft-panos-panay-amazon-alexa.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techhive.com/article/2073531/microsoft-panos-panay-amazon-alexa.html">now in charge of Amazon’s Amazon and Echo divisions</a>.

<p>OpenAI’s ChatGPT has removed the last barrier to using ChatGPT as a search engine, the requirement to log in. Now, it’s open to all. </p>



<p>OpenAI launched the feature last fall, but required a login. Now, the feature can be used without the need for registration.</p>



<p>ChatGPT Search is essentially just ChatGPT, and can be accessed at <a href="https://www.chatgpt.com">ChatGPT.com</a>. But below the “Message ChatGPT” box you’ll see a small icon called “Search” that can be clicked. When activated, it will turn blue, signaling that the web search is active. In my tests, however, I didn’t even need to click the “Search” icon; when I typed in “What’s the most important tech news today?” I received a similar list of answers whether the Search icon had been highlighted or not. In both cases, ChatGPT used the web search to pull its responses.</p>

<p>It’s been a few years since Microsoft started making changes to Chromium, the open-source engine that powers most web browsers today, including Chrome and Edge. One of the more recent changes grants more privacy to end users in Incognito and InPrivate modes.</p>



<p>Turns out, Windows 10 and 11 no longer save content to the clipboard history when you copy stuff while in private browsing mode. Whatever inappropriate thing you’re copying, rest assured that it won’t end up in your clipboard history for others to spot.</p>



<p>This change was actually implemented by Microsoft back in 2024 and rolled out by Google later that year — but it wasn’t documented by either company, reports <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/02/06/microsoft-made-chromes-incognito-more-private-on-windows-11-windows-10/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.windowslatest.co

<p>Windows has come a long way from its wild west days, with multiple protections that guard against dangerous software. But attackers constantly try to evade those defenses—and recently succeeded with a 7-Zip exploit that sneaks past Windows’ normal wariness of downloaded files.</p>



<p>Discovered by Trend Micro researchers in September 2024, a vulnerability in 7-Zip allows hackers to bypass the typical Windows request for permission when you open a file from the web. Usually, Windows keeps track of what you download, branding those files with a “mark of the web.” This identifier triggers a Windows User Account Control prompt when apps or other executables are run. Similarly, Microsoft Office displays documents in a read-only mode, along with a warning.</p>



<p>Russian hackers dodged this safety by nesting a malicious archive file within a normal one. Th

<p>Chrome’s security features are simple, but as of late, they’ve been improving at a faster rate. Google wants you to know it, too—the most current version of its <em>What’s New</em> page highlights two improvements that aren’t strictly fresh, but likely new to many users.</p>



<p>First up: Easy group sharing of passwords. If you’re part of <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/family/details/">a family group</a>, you can send credentials through Google Password Manager’s Share feature. The <em>What’s New</em> page <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1#zippy=%2Cshare-your-password">promotes the mobile option</a>, but you can do so on PC, too. Head to <em>Settings > Autofill and passwords > Google Password Manager</em>. Click on the desired password entry, then on the <em>Share</em> button. A small overlay

<p>You really don’t need to pay upwards of $1,000 for a powerful computer these days. Mini PCs are way more capable than they used to be, and they’re way more affordable than equivalent laptops.</p>



<p>This decked-out GMKtec M7 Pro, for instance, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GMKtec-4-90Ghz-Desktop-Computer-Windows/dp/B0DCVTQ9CL/">down to just $500 on Amazon</a>, quite the discount from its $638 MSRP. Note that you’ll need Amazon Prime to fetch this special deal, but if you aren’t a Prime member, you can always <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">sign up for a 30-day trial</a> to score this deal.</p>



<p>This GMKtec mini PC runs on an AMD Ryzen 9 PRO 6950H processor and a hefty 32GB of DDR5 RAM that’ll zip through everything, from booting up your PC to multitasking dozens of apps and hundreds of Chrome tabs. There’s also 2TB of SSD storage,

<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 is several times faster than previous models of the compact and cheap computer. For less than a couple hundred bucks, you can have a computer that can do many tasks that previously required a regular PC, that consumes very little power, and for which the web is overflowing with exciting tutorials and projects you can take on.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll first walk you through how to build a Raspberry Pi 5 with maximum performance so you can use it for everything it’s capable of. To do that, you’ll need to take advantage of the board’s new ability to connect an SSD via PCI Express.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for the best way to watch the Super Bowl in 2025, the answer is more complicated than it should be.</p>



<p>Between cable providers, live TV streaming services, free streaming options, and a trusty antenna, there are an assortment of ways to watch the game. Unfortunately, many of them offer varying levels of video and audio quality, yet it’s weirdly difficult to get precise details on what those differences are.</p>



<p>Seriously, I shouldn’t have to spend hours chasing down PR contacts and interrogating them on 4K, HDR, and surround sound options for the Super Bowl. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2403044/the-sorry-state-of-live-4k-sports-streaming.html">This stuff should just be posted online by the companies involved</a>.</p>
