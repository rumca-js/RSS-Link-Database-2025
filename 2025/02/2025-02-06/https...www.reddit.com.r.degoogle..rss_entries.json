I am in the process of swapping out apps and services for Canadian/international/open-source ones; he&#39;s more of the &quot;why are you going to all that trouble?&quot; mind. I have a couple of gmail addresses that I want to get rid of. I did set up a Proton email address, but I don&#39;t think I love the service. I have maybe settled on Posteo for email using their address or purchasing a domain and linking that to it through them.</p> <p>I am now looking for a non-US (preferably) calendar app for Android that will still allow me to share to him and him to share to me. Does such a thing exist? Does that defeat the purpose of degoogling my calendar? I&#39;m super new to extricating myself from Google/Meta/etc, but as a Canadian and in light of all this bullsh*t going on with Frump, I am taking it as the push I need to get out from as much as I can.</p> <p>TIA!!</p> ",

I currently have (on chrome) 85 tabs and 11 groups. It gets too cluttered without them. I&#39;ve tried Firefox, and while you can group tabs, they don&#39;t collapse which defeats the point for me. I saw someone recommend the &quot;Simple Tab Groups&quot; extension but it isn&#39;t available for Android, and there isn&#39;t an alternative. Is there a different browser that has a similar tab grouping system? I value my privacy, but honestly it&#39;s a deal breaker for me.
