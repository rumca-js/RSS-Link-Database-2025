There are great cooperative games, of course, but it still feels like a shame to not be able to pass on the Catans/Carcassonnes/TicketsToRides you yourself loved as a kid.<br/> So the idea came up to collect hacks of &quot;How to un-competitify/colaboratify board games for children who don&#39;t like losing&quot; and make them easily available - e.g. on a YouTube channel - so that parents don&#39;t need to be super savvy hobby gamers who know the ins and outs of BGG.<br/> Maybe the hacks could be submitted by members of the community, and then we&#39;d film short videos presenting them over here, giving credit to the person who submitted the hack?

I&#39;m looking for a strategy rpg board game where you choose to play as 1 out of 3 characters during the renaissance or pre-renaissance era, though I am not sure about the era? One of the characters is a painter, and when you play as a painter, you can paint, sell your paintings, visit places, etc. All these objects and places are represented with cards. The aim, if I remember correctly is to survive and possibly thrive in whatever the character does. If anybody knows this game, I&#39;d gladly appreciate the name.
