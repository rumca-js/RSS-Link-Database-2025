As such, macOS copying will work again with\nErase, Then Copy backups. No update to SuperDuper is necessary\n(but feel free to install our v3.10 Beta 2, below). [...]</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your patience as we waited for the fix from Apple. I\nknow I\u2019m relieved that I (hopefully) will no longer be bombarded\nwith support because of it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/18/macos-15-2-bootable-backup-bug\">You may recall</a> that this was a bug introduced in MacOS 15.2, which prevented Shirt Pocket\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/superduper\">long-standing</a> utility <a href=\"https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/\">SuperDuper</a> from making a bootable clone of your startup drive.
