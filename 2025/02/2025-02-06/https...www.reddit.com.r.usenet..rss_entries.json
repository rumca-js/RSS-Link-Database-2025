I&#39;ve seen other threads talking about this. They have already charged my CC (I stupidly updated it as it had expired and only after the charge came through realized it was 50% more than my lifetime price).</p> <p>I&#39;m waiting for support to answer. Have others had a reasonable experience here with them making it right? I&#39;ve asked for a full refund or an extra year of hosting for the price I&#39;ve already paid and if not will do a VISA chargeback (which is not a good thing for them).</p> <p>This leaves a really terrible taste in my mouth for them, this was a pretty sketchy move! Just had to share it with the community here. Curious how they responded to others in the same situation. Only ones I&#39;ve read about are before they were overcharged ...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
