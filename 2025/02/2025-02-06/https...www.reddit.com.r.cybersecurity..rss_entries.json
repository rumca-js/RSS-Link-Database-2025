Some countries, like China, propose that all AI-generated content should have clear labels or watermarks to help spot misinformation and &quot;hallucinated&quot; AI content (false information generated by the AI itself). Platforms that host AI-generated content are also responsible for monitoring and removing anything that spreads false information or violates government guidelines. China has even implemented restrictions on AI models to prevent them from generating politically sensitive or harmful content.
