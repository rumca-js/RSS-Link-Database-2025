Bring Me The Horizon have covered Wonderwall by Oasis for Spotify Singles (and for charity). There have been many versions of the classic. I like some of them. I quite like this one too. We were hit with a painful blockage when we tried to include the whole track -  to listen to it in full, visit: https://open.spotify.com/track/68o1mDkJzpvTshz9xrfduC?si=a01cb148184c44e1

The new Darkness album comes out next month,  you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/
