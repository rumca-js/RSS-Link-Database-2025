President Trump moved to close a loophole called “de minimis” that has fueled a boom in cheap goods being shipped from China to the U.S. It’s a provision that allows any shipments under $800 to enter America tariff-free regardless of where the products come from. WSJ’s Jonathan Cheng traveled to the world’s largest wholesale market called the Yiwu International Trade Market to see how these products are making their way into U.S. markets. If you’ve ever bought anything on Temu or Shein, there’s a good chance it came from this bazaar near China’s east coast, which is close to huge ports in Shanghai and Ningbo. 

WSJ explores why this market in China, the center point of global wholesale trade, has found itself in the U.S. government’s crosshairs.
