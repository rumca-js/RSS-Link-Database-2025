But here’s the thing—someone, somewhere, at some point, had to step outside of any known pattern and just do something new.</p> <p>Think about it: The first human who harnessed fire had no guidebook. There was no “pattern” to follow—just curiosity, observation, and the willingness to experiment (or maybe a complete accident, but either way, it was an original leap).</p> <p>The first humans who made the connection between seeds and crops weren’t following an agricultural tradition—it didn’t exist yet.</p> <p>Copernicus (1543) looked at the sky and said, “What if we’re not the center of the universe?” despite the entire world believing otherwise.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As so many people, this AI race makes me concerned about the impact on humanity. When AGI has automated most (office) jobs, people still need a sense of belonging in the world. UBI would create a society without purpose. How can we avoid this? Can we build a UBI society where additional benefits (housing, income, status) can be earned by taking care of (your own) kids, parents, the sick, other people? This will create a society where the bring work is automated and people can do what they should be good at. Being human. That means people who take care more then average (in number of people or more difficult care) earn the right to live in better housing, own more land, etc. We can ask AI to help organise this. I dont see any other options. What kind of society must be build to keep distribution of houses / land / a feeling of well being etc fair? Communism wasnt the way, the current proposed way of UBI feels like communism. Do we need to invent somet

I have generated some articles in different times and the quality looks pretty impressive in a sense that you can gather information on very niche research topics on which limited or almost no research papers have been published. But the main problem of this tool is, very much inconsistency in terms of service availability. When it was released earlier there was no major issue in early days. But over the time their server has been filled with issues like getting permanently stuck in the middle of processing an article or not taking any inputs at all. Another issue can be highlighted which is strict limitations while giving prompts. Apart from these issues, the model feels to have really solid potential for future u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This paper proposes a novel approach to reinforcement learning for LLMs by deriving implicit rewards from the generation process itself, without requiring explicit human labels. The core idea is to extract training signals from intermediate generation steps, allowing for denser feedback during model training.</p> <p>Key technical points: - Introduces a process-aware reward model that evaluates partial sequences - Uses entropy regularization to balance exploration vs exploitation - Implements reward extraction through careful prompt engineering - Validates results across multiple model architectures and tasks</p> <p>Results show improvements in: - 15% increase in task completion rates compared to baseline - 12% reduction in hallucination rates - 8% improvement in adherence to specified constraints - Significant reduction in computational overhead vs traditional RLHF</p> <p>I think this could be particularly impactful for training more reliable and con

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reflecting on a limitation that&#39;s becoming increasingly problematic when working with AI tools. While these models are undoubtedly powerful, their knowledge cutoff dates (many still stuck in 2023 or even 2021) are starting to feel like a real bottleneck, especially in fast-moving fields like software development.</p> <p>From my experience, this is particularly noticeable when working with programming languages and frameworks. While I&#39;ve found that some models (like Claude) manage to stay current, others seem frozen in time despite being able to access open-source resources. Even their &quot;expert&quot; capabilities seem constrained by these cutoff dates.</p> <p>Yes, solutions like OpenAI&#39;s fine-tuning exist, but they feel more like workarounds than proper solutions. I&#39;m curious if others are hitting similar walls in their work, especially in domains where staying current is crucial.</p> <p>What&#39;s your experience wit

The TT (or its owner) can monitor the collective unconsciousness before we even realize it exists and secretly take control of us at a higher artificial cognitive level.
