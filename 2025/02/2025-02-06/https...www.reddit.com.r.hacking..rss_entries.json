With the state of hacking and penetration tools (which I know nothing about) do you think it&#39;s possible this small team of tech savants has been able to identify and download internal databases from the connected network, as is being claimed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Marc00s\"> /u/Marc00s </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ije85s/how_plausible_are_reports_of_doge_team_accessing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ije85s/how",
