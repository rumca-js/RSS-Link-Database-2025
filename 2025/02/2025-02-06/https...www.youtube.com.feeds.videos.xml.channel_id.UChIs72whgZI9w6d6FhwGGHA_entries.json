        "description": "Sponsor: Antec Flux Pro case on Amazon https://geni.us/CaPv\nWe review Cyberpower's pre-built gaming PC with an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D CPU in it. The system has all the right components, a competitive price, and a horrible cooling solution that throttles the CPU by 200 MHz all-core. It's an unfortunate story as old as our first reviews of Cyberpower's pre-built PCs. The 9800X3D overheats at 95 degrees Celsius under the 240mm liquid cooler, which we think is partly related to poor contact. The case is also deceptively closed off, despite appearing relatively open. We were disappointed by this one, as everything else about it was excellently done. OS install was clean, the BIOS was right, the drivers were recent, the build was overall good.\n\nWatch our prebuilt review playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNxHEj9PKoY&list=PLsuVSmND84QuM2HKzG7ipbIbE_R5EnCLM\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
