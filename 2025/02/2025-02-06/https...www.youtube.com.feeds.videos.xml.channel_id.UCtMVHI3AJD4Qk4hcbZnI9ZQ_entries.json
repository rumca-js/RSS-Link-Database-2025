        "description": "Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! I've talked a lot about big gaming publishers like Ubisoft and as someone who's grown up alongside EA's dominance mid 2000s, it's a shame to see them slipping after several bad releases. This week's been pretty huge for those into some of their longterm franchises like Battlefield, I'm here to remind everyone to stay cautious with anything they do. Thanks for watching!\nLike, Comment and Subscribe for more videos!",
