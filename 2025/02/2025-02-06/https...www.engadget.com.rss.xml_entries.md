<p>On the positive side, most of the big businesses in games that would have hosted sprawling booths at Los Angeles Convention Center back in the day have already signed on to this new endeavor.

Each participating title has an information box, where developers answer questions, such as how long they expect the game to be in early access.

<p>The Zenfone 12 Ultra, announced today, is ASUS&#39;s latest flagship smartphone, and much like its competitors, it leans hard into AI.</p>
<p>Thanks to a Snapdragon 8 Elite, the Zenfone 12 Ultra can perform AI tasks offline and online through the cloud, including transcribing audio, summarizing articles and documents and providing real-time interpretation on calls for supported languages. It can also use Circle to Search much like other Android phones. The onboard AI is powered by Meta’s Llama 3 8B language model, which works without an internet connection.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Zenfone 12 Ultra’s FHD+ AMOLED display measures 6.78 inches and has a standard refresh rate of up to 120Hz under normal operation, and up to 144Hz while gaming. A rear tri-camera system handles photo and video and consists of a 50-megapixel Sony Lytia 700 sensor with a six-axis gimbal stabilizer, a 32MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultrawide lens with a field of view of 120 degrees.
