After decades, Marky Mark is back as a psycho on the big screen, and to show his commitment to the role, he shaved his head bald! Someone call Oscar from the Oscars!

Flight Risk definitely raises some questions. Like why does this hitman take them on a joyride if his mission is just to kill them? How did that lady forget she had a phone?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for Flight Risk!
