## Is anybody else here owed money by Lynx Mixed Reality?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, on Jan 25, 2023, I orderer the Lynx R1 Headset (Enterprise Edition) from their website (not Kickstarter) for $1,299. The company had production issues for a while, which was understandable for a young hardware startup, so everything was delayed. Being a startup founder myself, I hoped for the best and thought they&#39;d overcome this and deliver a good product eventually. </p> <p>Around Sept 9, 2024, Stan Larroque, CEO of Lynx, posted a video on YT where he spoke about the company being literally back from the dead and announced that the headset will have no controller support but only hand tracking. He also implied they raised some money so refunds were possible if anyone wanted one. From the start I had no use for a device that only supports hand tracking and requested a refund. I only got an automated e-mail confirmation, sometimes after that my order started showing as cancelled in their e-shop.</p> <p>However, I never received my money back.

One of the things we’ve been experimenting with is making sure fights feel <strong>rewarding, not just reactive</strong>—where <strong>timing, precision, and movement flow matter more than speed-spamming attacks.</strong></p> <p>For example, in our system:<br/> <strong>- Attacking with controlled swings does more damage than random flailing.</strong><br/> <strong>- Enemies adapt to how you fight—going full berserker makes them fight back harder.</strong><br/> <strong>- Dodging is physical—not a button press, but actually moving out of the way.</strong></p> <p>This got us thinking—what’s the <strong>most satisfying</strong> combat mechanic you’ve ever seen in a VR game? Whether it’s <strong>physics-based weapons, enemy AI, hit react
