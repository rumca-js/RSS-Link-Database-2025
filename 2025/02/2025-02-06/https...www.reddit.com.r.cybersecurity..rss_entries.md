<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AI-generated content is becoming more realistic, and it&#39;s getting harder to tell what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not. Some countries, like China, propose that all AI-generated content should have clear labels or watermarks to help spot misinformation and &quot;hallucinated&quot; AI content (false information generated by the AI itself). Platforms that host AI-generated content are also responsible for monitoring and removing anything that spreads false information or violates government guidelines. China has even implemented restrictions on AI models to prevent them from generating politically sensitive or harmful content. Companies failing to comply can face fines and legal consequences. </p> <p>What do you all think? Should we start watermarking AI content or would that just complicate things? And how do we balance innovation with the need for transparency?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sy

If a red teamer or pen tester managed to use RPC SpoolerChangeNotify to coerce a connection from a user endpoint (not a server) back to itself and on an adjacent port, forward the authentication material to a C2 endpoint, apparently incoming requests could be captured and relayed to a domain controller, then used to modify the MsDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of the original endpoint object in AD. This in turn allowed the key pair associated with that modified attribute to request a TGT from the DC, then recover an NT hash.</p> <p>Supposedly the print spooler service allows this to happen, which if that&#39;s the case, how is this remediated?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the heading says, I’m mainly a blue teamer, but want to get more hands on training. Trying to decide if I should go BTL1 or ejpt. I want to become a well rounded security professional who understands both sides of the spectrum. I have 10 years IT experience but only 2 in security. Would getting one before the other help in obtaining the other, lol hope that makes sense. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Glad_Pay_3541"> /u/Glad_Pay_3541 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1iis3rj/debating_going_ejpt_or_btl1/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1iis3rj/debating_going_ejpt_or_btl1/">[comments]</a></span>

## Looking for Enduring High-Level Cybersecurity Training for My Family

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m on the hunt for a solid, high-level but digestible cybersecurity training resource that I can go through with my wife and kids. Ideally, it would be something that’s engaging, covers both common online threats (like phishing, malware, and social engineering) and basic best practices (password security, two-factor authentication, safe browsing habits, etc.), and isn’t just a one-time session but offers lasting knowledge.</p> <p>I’m open to a video course or a structured program that we can all watch and learn together. Bonus points if it includes real-world examples, interactive components, or resources I can reference later when reinforcing these concepts with my family.</p> <p>Does anyone have recommendations? I want them to understand not just what to do, but why it’s so important, so they can apply it consistently without being overwhelmed.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit
