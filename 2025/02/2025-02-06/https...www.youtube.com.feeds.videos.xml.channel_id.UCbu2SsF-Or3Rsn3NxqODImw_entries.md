This is our first-ever hands-on gameplay of three games in the Capcom Fighting Collections 2: Capcom Vs SNK 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and Project Justice. Watch us use Sagat's crouching fierce over and over again, play arcade mode through all three games, and test drive training mode. Gameplay has an in-game video filter.
