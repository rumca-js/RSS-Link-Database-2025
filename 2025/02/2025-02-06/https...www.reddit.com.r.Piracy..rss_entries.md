<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is an older woman in a film class I took last semester today who asked me if I had any foreign movies I might be able to give her as she just got a regionless DVD player after our course inspired her. I have none, but I do have a bunch of blank DVD&#39;s and pirated movies and she said she&#39;d love to have some. However, as these are mostly foreign films, I was curious if there was a way to ensure that subtitles were an option while watching? Or keep them always on I suppose, as I do not think she&#39;d speak the languages of the films.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, so I recently picked up the dub for Astroboy (2003), since it seems no one bothered to ever upload it. I want to make a purely dub release, but it got me thinking about dual audio releases. Curious of any best practices I should consider? I know some people like the subs to be default, but honestly, those people are heathens and I won&#39;t be encouraging their behavior (/s).<br/> Jokes aside though, what are some best practices? Be good to have a nice thread to encourage those who are new to releasing to follow them, myself included. I get tired of having to fix releases I get. Great example, I got a release once where the subs were all unknown language with no titling. So I had to figure out which was was the full subs and which was the signs/songs on a TON of videos.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TLunchFTW"> /u/TLunchFTW </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/
