Mel Gibson left Joe Rogan stunned as he shared his encounter with a Chi Kung master who could channel energy to perform incredible feats, like lifting him eight inches off the ground. - "I went up the wall, and there were about eight inches of air under my heels. Then I came back down, and it freaked me out! I was so freaked out that I went to a priest and said, 'Is this guy demonic or something? Because he lifted me off the wall!'"
