        "description": "Nintendo doesn\u2019t have the best track record with generation transitions in the past \u2013 and while they have sidestepped any branding confusion issues by naming their upcoming new console Switch 2, the question of pricing is one that remains open for now. \n\nNintendo followed up on the 150 million unit selling Nintendo DS with the 3DS, a system that should have been a sure success \u2013 but fumbled it in part (especially early on) because of unreasonably high pricing that completely stalled all momentum for months after launch. \n\nWith the upcoming Switch 2, it is in their best interests to not repeat any such mistakes. What, then, would be the best and ideal price for the new console?",

        "description": "While looking forward to Monster Hunter Wilds, you've probably seen the development discuss Monster Hunter World and its influence. For all intents and purposes, Wilds is an evolution of the formula with larger, more expansive regions to explore and even higher-fidelity visuals. But what sets the two apart?\n\nMaybe it's the seamless exploration, where traveling from base to locale and one locale to another is now possible. Perhaps it's the new mount that allows for freer movement and can store a second weapon to swap to when necessary. Underwater exploration is also back, opening up new avenues absent from World.\n\nYet that's only the tip of the iceberg, as Monster Hunter Wilds also lets you set up camps anywhere, cook entire meals on the go, customize more radial menus, and much more. Let's dive into the biggest differences between it and Monster Hunter World here.",
