It would most likely have switched to some flavour of RISC, more memory, and enhanced blitter/copper. Probably a programmable GPU of sorts.</p> <p>I&#39;m less sure about the OS side though. I think by that time having protected memory would have become an absolute requirement. And that forces a pretty major shakeup of what AmigaOS looks like - you need a much clearer distinction between OS code and application code. You can&#39;t just throw pointers around the way we had. And when I try going down that line I think the OS pretty much morphs into UNIX.</p> <p>So that was really what I was wondering is if",
