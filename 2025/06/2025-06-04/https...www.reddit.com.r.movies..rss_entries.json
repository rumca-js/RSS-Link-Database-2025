Early in the movie there are several short sequences of characters speaking Russian. There are no subtitles which I found odd, I dig through the settings, turn subtitles and captioning on, all with no success. All closed captioning offers me is &quot;characters speaking in Russian&#39;. These were short little exchanges so I figured they just made the movie that way. Weird but whatever. About an hour later a full 5 minute conversation is happening in Russian and I realize no way they actually just made this without subtitles. I dig through the settings and options again with no success. I started doing some googling and found THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. Some titles don&#39;t have subtitles for other languages so you just are not allowed to understand the dialogue if you watch on Prime I guess? I switched to paramount plus, went to those sequences",

The girl is wearing a pink dress in the flashback and subsequently is wearing a pink dress over a white t-shirt. Similarly the boy is wearing a plaid shirt with shorts in both scenes. After not seeing his kids for ~2 years, the chance that his kids are wearing nearly the same outfit and are in the same location in the backyard is nearly impossible.</p> <p>With most directors I think you can let this slide, but Chris Nolan is particular about every detail of his movies.
