They offer practice tests online, and I was wondering if I took one and took a picture of all 90+ questions to get detailed breakdowns would I be able to upload all of them? Is there a cap? What\u2019s the difference between regular and premium. I\u2019m willing to spend the 19$ and study myself but I am not paying a tutor I refuse. Any help or other AI apps that y\u2019all may know of that are good please lmk</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeTemporary5714\"> /u/TradeTemporary5714 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1l3je8x/image_upload_quantity/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1l3je8x/image_upload_quantity/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This one\u2019s based on real-world feedback from deployments (at T-Mobile) and early design work with Box. I know this sub is mostly about sharing development efforts with LangChain, but if you&#39;re building agent-style apps this update might help accelerate your work - especially agent-to-agent and user to agent(s) application scenarios.</p> <p>Originally, the gateway made it easy to send prompts <em>outbound</em> to LLMs with a universal interface and centralized usage tracking. But now, it now works as an <strong>ingress</strong> layer \u2014 meaning what if your agents are <em>receiving</em> prompts and you need a reliable way to route and triage prompts, monitor and protect incoming tasks, ask clarifying questions from users before kicking off the agent? And don\u2019t want to roll your own \u2014 this update turns the LLM gateway into exactly that: a data plane for agents</p> <p>With t",
