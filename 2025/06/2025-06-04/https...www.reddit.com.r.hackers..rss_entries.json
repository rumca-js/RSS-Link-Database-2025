Here\u2019s what happened: \u2022 About 6 hours ago, I got a message that a Google Takeout export was created for my account. I was sleeping at that time. \u2022 I never used Google Takeout or asked for any data export. \u2022 Google says the export was done from my usual device (my iPhone). \u2022 The export included a lot of data (49 products, about 370 GB). \u2022 When I checked, nobody downloaded the export files yet. \u2022 I didn\u2018t have 2FA on but turned it on and recently changed my password to a strong one. \u2022 My old password was weak and similar to passwords I used on other sites. \u2022 I can\u2019t delete the export, only wait for the download link to expire. \u2022 No other suspicious activity shows up in my security checks, only this export.</p> <p>My questions: 1. Can Google do a Takeout export without me asking? 2. If a hacker did this before I changed my password and added 2FA, can they still access my account",
