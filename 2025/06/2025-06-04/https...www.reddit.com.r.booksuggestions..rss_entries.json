I was wondering if anyone had recs for audio books that are both really good books and a really well done recording/narration. I\u2019ve particularly loved the audio book recordings of Dune and American Psycho, which both had setting ambience added in to the recording (wind, traffic noises, restaurant chatter), and I also loved the audio books of kitchen confidential and blood meridian, which both just had outstanding next level narration. Based on what I\u2019ve mentioned, I don\u2019t really mind fiction or nonfiction, so long as it\u2019s well written. I typically avoid young adult, anything smutty (for smuts sake, I don\u2019t mind a little plot relevant sex), and before the huge fanbase starts flooding the comments, I have 0 interest in dungeon crawler Carl </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Salty_Information882\"> /u/Salty_I",

From a glance he is manly but even my father has made comments on his materialistic ideals and shopping habits. I have to practically force him to go on walks or go to the beach twice in a row with me. I can\u2019t imagine what it would take to get him to go on a bike ride. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he treats me great but we grew up very differently. I don\u2019t think his parents ever told him no. Now that we are approaching mid twenties, his love for expensive clothing and accessories doesn\u2019t match the income of a student. I just want to give him a book that can help him wake up and inspire him to be the best version of himself.

I love the story and characters, and particularly enjoy the location. I have always been interested in Native cultures, and I was wondering if anyone had any book recommendations with a similar feel. Remote Canada/Alaska setting, Native characters, rom-com self discovery theme. Anything along this line would be great and would help me extend my current interest since Season 1 is not very long. Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Moose_Caboose12\"> /u/Moose_Caboose12 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l2s4wm/book_recommendation_based_on_tv_show/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l2s4wm/book_recommendation_based_on_tv_show/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It can be anything, but I am especially looking for the meaning of light, what it can express and how. Something about honest pureness. Some book that actually express many emotions, and searching for something.
