One can argue there&#39;s an element of his works being a sign of the times they were written, but the fact of the matter is that his female characters are decidedly lackluster and/or painfully one-dimensional in most of his novels. Most of them are either stereotypical 1900s housewife/widow types or some generic form of working woman like an office secretary. There are perhaps a couple exceptions in ALL of his first 11 novels that defy those characteristics, and those who do defy them don&#39;t get much screen time.</p> <p>Well, I&#39;m happy to report that he finally managed",

That person reads/annotates then sends it to the 3rd person to do the same. Ideally there are 3-4 sometimes more people in groups. Sometimes it\u2019s just between 2 people. When it gets to the last person, they mail it back to the original owner for their person to read with all the annotations &amp; they\u2019ll keep the books. Again ideally, with a 3-4 person group, everyone picks a book to send out &amp; everyone gets their book back at the end of the rotation. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheWordLilliputian\"> /u/TheWordLillipu",

I\u2019m currently reading \u201cThe Appeal\u201d and I noticed a pattern \u2014 in all three books that I\u2019ve read so far, one of Hallett\u2019s characters deals with impaired vision. I won\u2019t include more details or list the other titles to avoid spoilers, but I wanted to know other people\u2019s thoughts on why she includes it in so many (or possibly all) of her novels? Is it a symbol of the genre, reflecting how the characters and/or readers are symbolically blind in regard to the plot? Does blindness have personal significance to her as an author?

More particularly, it&#39;s the <em>antagonists</em>. For example - there are many people out there who haven&#39;t read Moby-Dick, or only vaguely know what it&#39;s about. But high chances they know Captain Ahab. Most people do. They also remember others: Count Dracula from <em>Dracula</em>, Inspector Javert from <em>Les Miserables</em>. Sometimes the main character/narrator doesn&#39;t have to be memorable if the villain is",

When I was around 11, so in 2001-ish, I read a book that brought me to tears &amp; I&#39;m dying to reread it. Here&#39;s what I remember:</p> <ul> <li>It was part of a series, maybe some kind of drama/mystery series with a female MC.</li> <li>The books weren&#39;t long, maybe around 200 pages? I remember them being shorter than the Series of Unfortunate Events books.</li> <li>I think it was one of the later books in series.</li> <li>Towards the end of the book, someone lost a baby...not sure if she had an abortion or miscarriage, but she definitely lost a baby. I&#39;m not sure if it was the MC or another character close to her.</li> </ul> <p>Any suggestions are appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoodsNotNudesPlz\"> /u/NoodsNotNudesPlz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

I just finished reading the Wayward Pines Trilogy (I know, late to the party) by Blake Crouch and I wanted to discuss it a bit. I&#39;ve read several of Crouch&#39;s other books and enjoyed them quite a bit, so I was excited to dig into Wayward Pines. Overall, I really enjoyed the novels and breezed through them, but there was ONE really big nagging gripe that started at the end of book 1 and just never got cleared up, so I figured I would see if others felt the same way or if I somehow missed it when they explained it. </p> <p>**SPOILERS AHEAD**</p> <p>So at the end of book one we basically get the big reveal that Pilcher has created this town to save the human race from extinction, and they are actually 1,800 years in the future. Ok, cool twist. Not what I was expecting, but I am cool with it. But what bugged me was why did he make the people in Wayward Pines&#39; existences so miserable? They couldn&#39;t talk to anyone about anything",
