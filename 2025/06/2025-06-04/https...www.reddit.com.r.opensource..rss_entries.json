New here, i hope this kind of post is accepted.<br/> I am looking for a program to use as an archive for the books i read and the sentences i underline. I already have a setup for that on Notion but i want to move away from it because I am fed up with cloud services, the logins, the bloat etc. Also, Notion it&#39;s pretty slow.<br/> I was looking for something open source, possibly using markdown or other accessible document type for storing data. The functionalities it&#39;d need to have are:<br/> Having a list of books, each with some properties (title, author, my rating, genre...)<br/> Showing the list, possibly as a table with editable queries<br/> Having a list of quotes from the books (each with the quote itself, but also the page and the genre)<br/> Showing each quote both in another table and in the page of the book it is from<br/> Having some form of mobile support. Now, this is tricky, but i don&#39;t need a cloud mobile app, I was think",
