I know it sounds awesome and I&#39;m definitely excited but I&#39;m also pretty nervous because I have worked as a SOC analvst and moved to pentest now. I definitely did the labs on portswigger but still feeling nervous because I don&#39;t know what to do when they will provide me a web application. I guess labs and real life pentesting is different so that&#39;s where my confidence is lacking.</p> <p>I wanted to know: 1. How do you guys start from a initial project, like when a web app is given to you? 2. What to see, like suppose there&#39;s a login page, should I directly move to use payloads and make reports? 3. Are the portswigger labs enough to do pentest or systematically is it different in a real project scenario? Like I know about the scopes and checklist but still 4. Should I be worried about getting kicked out?",
