The different parts of a turn are named after different times of the day. However, every player finished their whole day before the next player begins theirs. Thematically it would make more sense for everyone to complete birdsong first before anyone goes to daylight. It would also add to the theme of the nocturnal factions having more actions during the evening. I imagine this would slow down gameplay (and also just completely change it) so I am not suggesting a variant.

We loved the theme, the asymmetry, and the unique mechanics, but fast forward half a year and we haven\u2019t touched it since our first 3 plays back in October. </p> <p>We both feel that the endgame mechanic is deeply unsatisfying, and as such, haven\u2019t been motivated to get it back on the table. Particularly for the shark, so much work goes into deduction and maneuvering that for the endgame to come down to random chance feels like a cop-out. I get that there has to be some way to mitigate the \u201cshark attacks a random block and it happens to be right\u201d that could kill the game early, but the choice to hinge the crux point of the game on \u201cpick a random card, 1 in 3 chance!\u201d feels to us as though it discounts the strategy it took for the shark to get there. </p> ",
