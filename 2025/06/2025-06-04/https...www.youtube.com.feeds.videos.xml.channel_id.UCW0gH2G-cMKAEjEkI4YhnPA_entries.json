Radagast was one of the first book characters that made me realize how big (and sometimes mysterious) Tolkien's world is.  W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop always makes incredible pieces and replicates characters and environments from the films with incredible detail and accuracy.  An amazing piece!\n\nProduct Description:\nAs it is told in the ancient lore, Radagast, a wizard of curious and rustic disposition, dwelt in a house most befitting his nature. In a secluded glen in the southern reaches of Mirkwood\u2122, where the shadows of the great trees grew long, there lay Rhosgobel, the \"brown dwelling.\" This abode was no ordinary cottage but rather a reflection of its master: untamed, overgrown, and imbued with a strange and whimsical charm.\n\nStatue Details:\n1:6 scale\nLimited Edition of 800\nPrimarily made from polystone\nPots and pans made ",
