Nixplay recently changed the subscription prices so it seemed like a good time to move off their service and host the photos locally. I opened up the frame, found the unused internal USB port, replaced the frame software with my own, and set up a local photo server for it on our Synology. I wrote up the whole process here: <a href=\"https://ezhart.com/posts/digital-frame-hacking-1\">https://ezhart.com/posts/digital-frame-hacking-1</a></p> <p>Except for some Dropbox syncing (for my wife&#39;s convenience), the whole thing is hosted within our home network.

Although it\u2019s been bit of a learning curve I am getting the hang of it and I am able to deploy apps via 1-click and docker compose for non native apps (some trouble with dokploy because of nixpack while using compose). </p> <p>I wanted to know before deciding on one or the other (coolify &amp; dokploy) if anyone has been running apps and services on coolify successfully without any bugs or errors (especially apps not offered as one click). I also notice that none of my domains are secure when deploying including coolify itself.</p> <p>Also wanted to know my options of customizing each app. I would like to eventually brand each app and offer a SSO for my clients. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sudden-Start-1945\"> /u/Sudden-Start-1945 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l2sszz/a",

The URL&#39;s, ID and client secret that Pocket provides are pretty straightforward, but there&#39;s other values (like scope) that aren&#39;t defined anywhere in Kasm. I didn&#39;t see a doc for Kasm on PocketID&#39;s website, but I&#39;m happy to contribute one if I can get this working.</p> <p>I did reference the <a href=\"https://www.kasmweb.com/docs/latest/guide/oidc.html\">Kasm documentation</a> on OIDC, and I&#39;ve set the values for scope as the ones listed in <a href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes\">Auth0&#39;s docs on OIDC scopes</a>. I get PocketID to show its trying to access email and profile (but doesn&#39;t seem to accept username or preferred_username or any variation?) but it just throws an internal server error once it passes through PocketID back to Kasm.</p> <p>Appreciate any help anyone who",
