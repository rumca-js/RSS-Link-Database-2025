I believe Xbox gamepass games aren&#39;t possible because they are on the Xbox app, but I do have plenty of steam games and am familiar with what proton is and what it does. I was curious about trying steamOS but I believe it isn&#39;t ready to be used with Nvidia GPUs quite yet. What is a very straightforward but high performance distro for me to try? I&#39;d rather keep tinkering to a relative minimum but don&#39;t mind troubleshooting here or there and using the terminal some. Is cachyos worth it vs just say mint or Ubuntu? I don&#39;t want to say the b word here (bazzite) but is that the best bet?</p> <p>7600x3d AMD CPU, 4070 super Nvidia gpu for driver reference it if matters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesLahey08\"> /u/JamesLahey08 </a> <",

The seller is asking 650 euro for it.</p> <p>Just looking for some advice. I currently have a MacBook M2 Max with 32gb, which I like, but the privacy concerns and limited flexibility with Linux are pushing me to switch. Thinking about selling the MacBook and using the Dell mainly for Linux and running local LLMs.</p> <p>Does anyone here have experience with this model, especially for LLM use? How does it perform in real-world situations, both in terms of speed and efficiency? I\u2019m curious how well it handles various open-source LLMs, and whether the performance is actually good enough for day-to-day work or tinkering.</p> <p>Is this price about right for what\u2019s being offered, or should I be wary? The laptop was originally bought in November 2024, so it should still be fairly new. For those who have tried Linux on this particular Dell, any i",

Hope you like it! </p> <p>Motivation:</p> <p>I got an 9800X3D a few months ago and since I like using Steam&#39;s shader pre-caching, I got a bit annoyed that the CPU is spending a lot of time at higher temperatures when processing the shaders after a Kernel or driver upgrade.</p> <p>Then I started playing FarCry 5 which also has a particular problem: it boosts the 9800X3D constantly beyond what is necessary and - compared to other, heavier games - also raises the temperatures of the CPU by more than 10 degrees. Finally, games with lengthy shader pre-compilation steps at 100% CPU usage (such as The Last of Us) also tend to push the CPU to the limits for a significant amount of time. </p> <p>At some point, I discover the option of disabling CPU boost via the Linux CPU drivers, which caps the 9800X3D at its maxim",

I wanna preface this with I\u2019m pretty new to the linux community, I\u2019ve spent a couple weeks doing research on moving my computer over to Arch Hyprland but the only thing holding me back is I can\u2019t seem to find much on how well it works with gaming. I have a very small bit of programming knowledge but I want to dive head first and learn more. I chose Hyprland because I absolutely love the tile managing way of using a computer, and I\u2019m also looking at ricing my desktop quite a bit. I also have an Nvidia GPU. I hear this can be somewhat problematic when it comes to Linux in some ways? Has anyone tried it? If so, do you think it\u2019s worth the effort? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooSprouts4686\"> /u/SnooSprouts4686 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1l2so1r/arch_hyprland_for_gaming/\">[link]",
