He recently built a computer specifically for this, got 50+ TB of storage to keep everything on, etc. I have no problem with this. The problem is that he has joined communities which require him to be seeding as much as he is downloading from these groups. He\u2019s now seeding a ton of stuff at all hours of the day, and that seems to be having a negative effect on the rest of us trying to play games. Online games are becoming unplayable most of the time. I was wondering, is there any way to limit the amount of bandwidth that his seeding is taking up?
