For context, Im NOT using ChatGPT as a therapist. I have a therapist that Im currently working with. However, within 5 minutes of chatting it helped me clarify what I need right now, draft a message to my therapist to help prepare for my session tomorrow, draft a message to my dad asking for help, and helped me get through the rest of my shift at work when I felt like I was drowning. It was a simple conversation but it took the pressure off and helped me connect with the real people I needed to connect to.
