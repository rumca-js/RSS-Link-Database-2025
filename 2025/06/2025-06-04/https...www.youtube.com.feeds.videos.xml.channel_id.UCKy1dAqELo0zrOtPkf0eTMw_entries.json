        "description": "Game of Thrones: Kingsroad reviewed by Sarah Thwaites on PC, also available on iOS and Android.\n\nGame of Thrones: Kingsroad attempts to respect its source material, imbuing its impressively recreated map of Westeros with grand architecture and appropriately grim side quests. Unfortunately, behind every interesting or well-thought-out idea is a frustrating pay wall, unsightly NPC animation, or grindy roadblock that halts any momentum you\u2019ve worked up. And the passable combat that acts as the foundation of this action-RPG isn\u2019t deep enough to make vaulting those hurdles much fun on its own. There\u2019s plenty to get up to in this intricate reimagining of the TV show\u2019s world, but ultimately, when you play the Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, you pay or you die.",
