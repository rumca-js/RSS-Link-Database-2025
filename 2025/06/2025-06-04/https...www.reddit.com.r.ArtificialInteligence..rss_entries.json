I imagine even in the next few years you could just take a video of someone and their voice, and use that to create a blackmail video. And even if there&#39;s some type of scanner that could prove it&#39;s fake who would believe you? how would average people have access to that? that information wouldn&#39;t get passed to everyone who saw it, many will claim its real anyway, and you could end up fired from your job and isolated from family and friends, arrested, exploited by scammers, and without any way to disprove it. how could you ever restore your reputation? it makes me really freaked out. i think going forward i no longer want to make any posts or videos showing myself on social media because things are looking a little scary.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

Now the best way to deal with the limitations that AI image generation naturally has, especially with consistency, is to work around it stylistically. Thats what I tried to work with.
