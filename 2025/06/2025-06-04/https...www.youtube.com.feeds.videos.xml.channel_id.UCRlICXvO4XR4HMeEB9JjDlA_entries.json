        "description": "Frank Dux claimed he was a ninja master trained by the mythical Senzo Tanaka, won the secret Kumite tournament, and inspired Bloodsport. In reality? It was all made up - no Kumite, no Tanaka, and his military record involves falling off a truck. His lies duped Hollywood, but today\u2019s Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) leaves no room for such fantasy; skill is tested, not invented.",
