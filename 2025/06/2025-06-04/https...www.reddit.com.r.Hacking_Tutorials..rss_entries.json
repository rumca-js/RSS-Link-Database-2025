I mean I literally needed some time to think what I can do to make it secure and I took a step and degoogled my test smartphone. Did that by Installing a costom AOSP rom to it but without Gapps. Now since we have no google , we have no Play Store to download app from so I installed F-droid. For browser I installed duckduckgo and termux in case I have to connect it to my pc at some point. Now I&#39;m asking you guys to help me build this ultimate project to final. I&#39;m not an expert and I don&#39;t want to use AI either. I want to stick to a situation where I know what I&#39;m doing rather than just doing what AI says. I want you guys to help me. I must have done something wrong or could have done better. Pls share your ideas to me I&#39;ll love to try out. What I need 1. An app for communication (call / text ) 2. An alternative file manager (able to extract zip,rar and ftp client) ",

My Grandma recently passed away and while cleaning out her house we found my Grandpa&#39;s old Windows 7 PC. He passed away about 5 years ago, so It hasn&#39;t been used in YEARS, but I took it home, hooked up some old peripherals and it still powers on and loads to the windows login screen.</p> <p>The problem is that no one alive knows what his password may have been. He was a commercial pilot for 30 years, and he loved taking pictures during his travels. I have no idea if any are on there, but I know it would mean a lot to my Mom if I could find any.</p> <p>Any advice for a total hacking/computer novice on how I could get into his account?
