I also used to use a Mediasonic 4-bay enclosure but drives kept dropping offline whenever Stablebit Scanner was trying to scan them. Rebooting was the only fix to get the drives recognized again by Windows. I got tired of dealing with that and picked up a Terramaster D6-320 6-bay enclosure (USB 3.2 Gen 2). Moved the drives over and things seemed good for a few months. Then one of the drive slots seemed to flake out. I had empty slots so moved the drives around and was good. Then a couple of months ago Stablebit starting reporting failing sectors on one of the drives. About 1 TB worth of data was corrupted. I recovered data from the cloud and now today another drive in there is spewing bad sectors again. I feel like this enclosure is killing my drives and need to replace it.</p> <p>TL;DR - I need a recommendation for a good 4 or 6 bay enclosure that works with Windows",

My current main hard drive is a WD Elements 5TB and I am running out of storage on it. I see two options that seem to fit me, </p> <p>Amazon has the Seagate Expansion 20TB HD USB 3.0 for $279 and rated at 4.6 stars.</p> <p>And Amazon has the WD Elements 20TB USB 3.0 for plug and play for $299 rated at 4.5 stars.</p> <p>All my current hard external hard drives are WD Elements (2x5TB and 2x1TB). </p> <p>The price is close enough so which one would be most easy to integrate into my current family of HDDs and more importantly have the least likelihood of failure?

For as long as I can remember, he bought DVDs and Blu-Rays at yard sales and gathered a collection of roughly 2000 disks (no joke), while I argued streaming was better. Except, I learned I was wrong...in the worst way. Two-ish years ago I went to watch my silver boxed Evangelion Neon Genesis DVDs and found, oh no, disk one won&#39;t load....in anything and disk 3 sometimes won&#39;t either. Since it&#39;s expensive to replace and it&#39;s pretty old, there&#39;s no way to know for sure a new set would even work. Then last year I got my first NAS, a little UGREEN NASync DXP2800 (2 bay, N100, 16GB RAM, 2x 10TB drives, RAID 1) and realized that physical media &gt; streaming. So I began ripping all my DVDs using a cheap portable DVD drive. I got my hands on an OWC Mercury enclosure with an HL Blu-ray drive, and Blu-rays got added to the list too. As I went I started to realize, oh shit, disk rot is showing on a lot ",
