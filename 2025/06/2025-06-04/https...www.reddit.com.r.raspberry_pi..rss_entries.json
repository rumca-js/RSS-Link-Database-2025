In the current setup im taking 5V from the pi to supply the module, with the default jumper on JD-VCC and VCC and GPIO16 and 17 into IN1 and IN2. </p> <p>As the module is activated by pulling the IN1 and IN2 to LOW/GND the measured idle voltage when running it with 5V is roughly 2.7v on the trigger pins. This shouldnt exceed the GPIOs 3.3v anytime i think.</p> <p>The setup generally works and the relays can be activat",
