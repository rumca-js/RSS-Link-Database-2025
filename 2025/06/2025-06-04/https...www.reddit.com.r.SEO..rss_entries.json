I&#39;m a bit torn on how to approach it. They don&#39;t have a physical store or own the venue (they only rent one every summer).</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of building a Hybrid approach, Local SEO (with the address hidden on GBP), to capture local search intent and also a national SEO approach so we&#39;re not missing out on tourists visiting from neighboring provinces (we&#39;re in a metropolis in our country, we have a good amount of tourists every summer).</p> <p>We have some budget for SEO but not that massive compared to other event organizers.</p> <p>I&#39;ve only done SEO campaigns for SaaS, E-commerce, and Digital Service businesses, which are National/International SEO campaigns and Local SEO is a bit new to me.</p> <p>Any advice/input would be appreciated.
