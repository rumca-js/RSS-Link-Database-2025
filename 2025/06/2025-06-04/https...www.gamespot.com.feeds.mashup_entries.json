To my recollection, the last time I played the series on a Nintendo system was Madden 08. After that, I switched to playing the game on Xbox consoles, and I've never looked back, as Xbox became my preferred platform. Just a few years after I quit Madden on Nintendo, EA Sports quit Madden on Nintendo, too. But the Switch 2 promises a new beginning for Madden on Nintendo platforms, and based on a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/\">Madden 26</a> demo I played on Switch 2, that future may be brighter than the pairing's lackluster past.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The last Madden game released for a Nintendo device was Madden 13, released in August 2012 for the Wii and Wii U. After that, EA stopped supporting the platform with its American football game, seemingly because technical limitations made it untenable to continue. In the W",
