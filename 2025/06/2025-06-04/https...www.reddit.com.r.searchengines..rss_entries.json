If I forget or \u201cwing it,\u201d I often end up on generic guides or click on instructions for the wrong model, which has led me to accidentally buy incompatible parts in the past.</p> <p><strong>What I\u2019d ideally like:</strong></p> <ul> <li>In my Google Account, I \u201cregister\u201d my main devices (laptop model, phone model, etc.).</li> <li>Then, when I search hardware/software queries, Google would automatically filter or prioritize results based on those registered devices\u2014no more manually typing \u201cfor XPS 13 9370\u201d every time.</li> <li>Bonus: a small icon or dropdown next to the sea",
