The problem is when I check the static folder I see also original files alongside hashed versions and this results in having a multiple event listeners being triggered on the same event and lots of bugs. I found this configuration to avoid copying original files: WHITENOISE_KEEP_ONLY_HASHED_FILES = True<br/> when I set this I see that for some reason only js files that are imported in the html file as script are imported and imports that are required from inside js files are failing. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s looking for original file in the static folder and with this config they don&#39;t exist.</p> <p>Everything is served in one VPS server.</p> <p>Anyways it&#39;s a huge mess, I jus",
