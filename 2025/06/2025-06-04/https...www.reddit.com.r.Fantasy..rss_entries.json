Last year was my first Bingo and I really enjoyed it but this year I&#39;m going to be less fussy about trying for HM or making sure every book is a perfect fit for the square. </p> <p>All that said, here are the first three reads. </p> <p><strong>Bingo Square: Five SFF Short Stories - Buried Deep and Other Stories by Naomi Novik</strong></p> <p><strong>Score:</strong> 4.5 out of 5</p> <p><strong>HM:</strong> Yes</p> <p>I&#39;ve always loved Novik&#39;s work and Buried Deep has some great stories. I really think many of them could be full novels in their own right. I really enjoyed the one set in the Scholomance world, and the last story which is set in her future novel&#39;s world. It felt like there was an overriding theme of exploration and the unknown with these stories. Each one felt layered, with unique ideas and characters. An impressive feat for short",
