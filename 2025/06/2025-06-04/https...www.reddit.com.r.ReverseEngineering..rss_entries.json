However, newer accounts do see this option, and it can even be accessed on the \u201chidden\u201d accounts through alternative methods (like external storefronts).</p> <p>This leads me to believe that: \u2022 The backend infrastructure for the feature exists and works across all accounts \u2022 The UI availability is likely controlled via a feature flag, A/B test, or account metadata</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to figure out if it\u2019s possible to: 1. Identify what API calls or requests are made when the feature is visible 2. Replicate or replay those requests on the \u201crestricted\u201d account 3. Possibly infer what parameter/flag differentiates the accounts</p> <p>Would pay around 500\u20ac</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019s familiar with browser developer tools, request capturing, API behavior analysis, o",
