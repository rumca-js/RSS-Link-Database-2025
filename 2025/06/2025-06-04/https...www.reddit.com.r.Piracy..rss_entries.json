I need to get 2 or 3 boxes since they live with other people who also use them. I&#39;m not very familiar with TV boxes and I know buying something random from a sketchy seller isn\u2019t the smartest move, so I wanted to ask here in case someone can help me out or point me in the right direction.</p> <p>My budget is around 30 to 40 USD (maybe a little more if it&#39;s a decent offer). I\u2019ve seen some options on AliExpress, but I\u2019m not sure how reliable they are. We\u2019re not looking for anything fancy, just something that runs smoothly at 1080p and lets them watch their series without problems. As long as it works well, we\u2019re happy.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",
