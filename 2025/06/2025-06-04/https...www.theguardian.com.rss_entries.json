Yet the figure was not someone I knew well. She was a guest in a house where I had lived only briefly in West Oakland, California. I\u2019d come to live there after the abrupt collapse of my marriage. I noticed the beautiful light that flowed from a window and touched the sleeper covered only by a white sheet. I captured the moment, and it came to join several photographs I had made over the years of sleeping figures, of my daughter, my sister, my husband sleeping in our hotel room in Merida, Mexico \u2013 even sleeping dogs, with limbs entwined. I work towards an idea across a number of images, often over several years.</p><p>A goal of mine as a photographer has been to find ways to avoid the intrusive aspects of photography. R",
