I use Skybox VR to play the movie files from a NAS (including full SBS rather than standard Half SBS). It&#39;s good, but lacks resolution.</p> <p>I&#39;m considering splurging. I was looking at getting a used AVP (despite not owning any Apple device and having had bad experiences with Apple products in the past - but I&#39;d pretty much just run Skybox VR on there so it shouldn&#39;t matter) but Dream MR seems to be a good alternative.

But when I looked into it, I realized there are almost no good VR apps for Android.</p> <p>My idea is an app that could work as a home for development\u2014a place where other devs could add features as plugins. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Controlling VR with voice commands</li> <li>Using normal phone apps (like TikTok or browsers) in VR</li> <li>Hand tracking so you could swipe in apps like TikTok just by moving your hands if the cameras can see them</li> </ul> <p>I don\u2019t know anything about development, and this might sound Dumb to some of you.

I know absolutely nothing about VR. What would he even do with it? He has never used a gaming system. I thought VR was mostly for games? Are there VR headsets that work only off your phone? Or would I need to get him a gaming system to go with it? I am asking for any/all recommendations for easy to use VR headsets\u2026 and, if necessary, the compatible gaming system? My husband has an old Xbox one, not sure if VR works with that\u2026 I just don\u2019t know. I tried googling but I am in over my head. He can barely use his iPhone. Is this just silly and I should get him something else entirely? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bubbly_and_Squeaky\"> /u/Bubbly_and_Squeaky </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1l2uob3/vr_headset_for_76_year_old/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; ",

What I&#39;d like to know is the local dimming number each device has. According to what I&#39;ve read, the Quest Pro has around 500, and the Pimax Crystal (Light) (supposedly with the same screen) has 576.
