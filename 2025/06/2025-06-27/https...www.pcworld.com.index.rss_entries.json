I get it, but it\u2019s true. The reality is that Amazon\u2019s newest <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/introducing-amazon-fire-tv-75-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6Y5BTL/\">Fire TV Omni QLED 4K model is now 48% off</a>, cutting it down from its original $1,100 price. Prior to this, the cheapest price it ever hit was $800\u2026 so if you want it, you better jump on it fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, this is a Fire TV, which means you get access to almost all the streaming services along with Xbox games streamed via cloud gaming (even if you don\u2019t have an Xbox console). It\u2019ll also fit right in with all your other Alexa-powered (or Alexa-compatible) tech, enabling you to issue voice commands to access the weather, look for information, or turn off your l",

And while some cables have specific connections, like USB-C, my wired network (such as it is) is just a random collection of colored Ethernet cables with tiny little markings telling me what they can or can\u2019t do. How much data can that cable transfer? I had no idea. And that\u2019s bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had never really thought about which Ethernet cables were being run between my cable modem, router, Xbox, and desktop PC. But I <em>had</em> performed speed tests more than once, and worried that my network was running slower than usual. And I also knew the problem: my network would run only as fast as its slowest segment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If my Ethernet cables were transferring less data than my router or gateway, I was po",
