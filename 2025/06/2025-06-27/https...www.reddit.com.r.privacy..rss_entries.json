It just seems a bit over zealous and counterintuitive for people to be blocking their own access to the current version of sites without even realising it thinking they\u2019re just escaping being tracked.</p> <p>I think a reasonable approach would be to have these tools be on a separate list so if people want to block ad trackers, analytics etc but not mangle the reasonable functioning experience of a site they can.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

This could be the end for alternative mobile OSs.</p> <p>And who stands to gain if Alphabet is weakened? Microsoft. They absolutely deserved their own antitrust lawsuits for their shady tactics like their monopoly on desktop OS\u2019 yet now they could break further into the browser market.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My graduate program is partially remote, including exams (which are mostly math related and are open book). They are understandably strict on AI use, but some allow it for homework and some do not. I\u2019ve found GPT, Gemini, &amp; Google very useful to explain how problems work step by step and typically would use Google to assist with doing homework for things like clarifying definitions quickly, etc but I\u2019m nervous this will set off a flag since simple Google searches use AI now. The fact that they offer up these \u201cpro\u201d accounts and strongly suggest we use their VPN remotely makes me think they are somehow following our remote activity, which honestly would be a huge invasion of privacy since I use my Google account for all sorts of personal things. Am I being paranoid?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JuiceBoxedFox\"> /u/JuiceBoxedFox </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comment",
