The unit runs roughly 16-18V DC.</p> <p>My plan is to hijack the raw video feed with a PAL Composite capture card, and hijack the audio in/out with some method of recording and producing sound, directly into the line. The base unit uses a bizarre &#39;Video over Power&#39; setup, which, given it&#39;s analog video, leads me to believe it&#39;s some variation of a DC voltage signal with the PAL signal overlaid, either stepping down the voltage or filtering it, depending on whether you want power or signal.</p> <p>At all times the actual base unit should remain functional with minimal interference.</p> <p>From research",
