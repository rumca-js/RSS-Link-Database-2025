Here I present a search query with links to both Google and DuckDuckGo search results for this query so every one can see for themselves how awful and utterly useless google search is becoming.</p> <p>The search query is &quot;i hate amy superstore&quot; (Amy is a character on a show called Superstore, that&#39;s all the background needed). The query itself is not of importance, I&#39;m sure I can find many other like this but just now I searched it to find like-minded people who share my opinion. Anyway, here are the results:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=i+hate+amy+superstore\">https://www.google.com/search?q=i+hate+amy+superstore</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&amp;q=i+hate+amy+superstore",
