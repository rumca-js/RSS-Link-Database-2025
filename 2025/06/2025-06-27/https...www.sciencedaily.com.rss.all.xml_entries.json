By analyzing ancient trace fossils, researchers uncovered evidence of complex, mobile organisms thriving 545 million years ago, well before the traditionally accepted timeline. These early creatures likely had segmented bodies, muscle systems, and even directional movement, signaling a surprising level of biological sophistication. Their behavior and mobility, preserved in fossil trails, offer new insight into how complex life evolved, potentially rewriting one of the most important chapters in Earth\u2019s evolutionary history.",

By using a compound normally found in pool disinfectants and a novel polymer that can be reused, the method avoids toxic chemicals like mercury and cyanide. It even works on trace gold in scientific waste. Tested on everything from circuit boards to mixed-metal ores, the approach offers a promising solution to both the global gold rush and the growing e-waste crisis. The technique could be a game-changer for artisanal miners and recyclers, helping recover valuable metals while protecting people and the planet.",
