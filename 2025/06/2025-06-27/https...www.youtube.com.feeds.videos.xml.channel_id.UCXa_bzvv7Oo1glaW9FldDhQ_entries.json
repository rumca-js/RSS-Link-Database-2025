        "description": "Konami\u2019s upcoming remake of a classic title in its Metal Gear Solid franchise carries the hopes of both the Japanese giant and fans of Big Boss\u2019 adventures alike. It would be an absolute treat to see the origin story of one of modern gaming\u2019s most iconic villains brought to life with a dash of current-gen goodness, after all.\n\nHowever, with only two months to go till Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is in our hands, and a troubling lack of deep dive footage from Konami, fans are left wondering if the studio has something to hide. Fortunately, the solution to this quandary is a simple one, and we hope Konami sees that in time.",
