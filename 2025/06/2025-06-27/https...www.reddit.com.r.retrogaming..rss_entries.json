Apparently, Tecmo Bowl: The Card Game is dropping at Target next month, and it looks like a full-on tabletop throwback. It\u2019s 1v1, offense vs. defense, with old-school play calls (Run 1, Pass 2, etc.), pixel art straight out of the NES era, and these Big Action cards like QB sacks and break tackles. As someone who grew up on Tecmo, this feels like such a deep cut. Super curious how it plays.

It was the playstation that me, my brother and my cousin used play every year at school summer break. Last time we played it was about 20+ years ago. I had tears in my eyes when I found it. It was hidden in a closet in a small room with other old stuff. It was in a plastic bag with 1 controller and 3 games - Nuclear strike, Nascar 2000 and NBA 99. All the other 100 games are lost. I think we gave them away to other kids.</p> <p>Now to the problem.</p> <ol> <li><p>When I try to play a game, it has some weird cd spinning sound (link <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1096982618/6a2837fc48\">https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1096982618/6a2837fc48</a> ).</p></li> <li><p>All 3 games lag and freeze at the menu. </p></li> <li><p>This ps is already modded (In my country all playstations were modded) so I burned Resident Evi",

Both have their pros and cons.

And yeah, this kind of question is interesting and sparks some interesting discussions. But I&#39;m more curious how the flagship of the fifth generation, the PS1, could been a failure. What things could have been happen differently in handsight which would have causes the failure of the Playstation?</p> <p>For me it would be the devkit. The one from Sony themselves was too difficult to make games for the system. The CEO from Psygnosis said this to the guys from Sony and even offered them to make a more efficient one for the PS1. The rest is history. I&#39;m pretty sure if this wouldn&#39;t happend the Playstation wouldn&#39;t be this giant successtory from today.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Parking-Coast-1385\"> /u/Parking-Coast-1385 </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

At first it launches fine, but after 1\u20132 minutes of gameplay, the game becomes extremely laggy. The FPS drops to 3\u20135, sound starts looping or glitching, and the whole thing becomes unplayable.</p> <p>So I decided to try running it in VirtualBox with a 32-bit Windows XP image. The game launches, I can enter my player name, but when I hit &quot;Start&quot;, it skips the level/map selection and weapon choice screen, and goes *directly to &quot;GAME OVER&quot;*. It\u2019s like the actual gameplay phase is missing or skipped entirely, and I only get the bad ending screen.</p> <p>Has anyone here played this game or knows it well enough to help? I&#39;d love to get it working properly. Thanks a lot!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mpistek\"> /u/mpistek </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/commen",

You can tell me if I&#39;m wrong, this is just my observation based on little evidence. </p> <p>My one friend, who lives in Australia, allowed her children the pleasures of playing Mario, Zelda, and all the good stuff when they were little. They particularly enjoyed Resident Evil and Final Fantasy. Now, as twenty-something adults, they enjoy any new game that has a good story attached. We like the same stuff, so I enjoy chatting with them about games the Horizon forbidden West, or Life is Strange, or whatever new Naughty Dog game is currently out. They still love the classics and one of them even has her own NES and SNES to play on. I never got to go to see them (yet.) but we talk online all the time.</p> <p>My other friend, she lives in Montana, and I knew her since childhood.",
