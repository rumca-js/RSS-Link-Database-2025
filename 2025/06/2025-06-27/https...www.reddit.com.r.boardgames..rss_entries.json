If I understand the rules, there is no distinction in deciding to take a skip (e.g., don&#39;t want to start an expedition with a high number) and being forced to take a skip (e.g., the number dice have numbers that are lower than what you are able to play). We decided to implement the house rule that if you <strong>can&#39;t</strong> make a move you don&#39;t have to take a skip. This has allowed us to not run out of skips as often and score more points.</p> <p>Is there anything wrong with this house rule that we&#39;re not considering? For me, I don&#39;t like being penalized for something that I have no choice about.</p> <p>Speaking of not being able to make a move, do I also understand the following scenario correctly: you&#39;re out of skips and the game is still going and it&#39;s your turn and you can&#39;t do anything with your roll, you just don&#39;t do anything",

In the rules for Dragon Eclipse, it states the expansion mystlings can also be used and that we can refer to the essence cost on the tier card.

I&#39;ve contacted Modiphius and (I believe) they are processing my request for replacements, however, my game is still in limbo while we wait. I really want to continue playing this weekend, and so I was wondering if anyone in this subreddit would be willing to take a picture of the backs of cards 84 through 98 for me to reference while we continue playing.

I&#39;ve personally found it really difficult to locate good backable projects that don&#39;t use AI, present new ideas, but also seem reasonable in their delivery and expectations. It covers board games, and card games and after the closure of the last few journalist-based boardgame outlets (Dice Breaker/Polygon), it seemed the right thing to do for people looking for hidden gems because it&#39;s proving more and more difficult.
