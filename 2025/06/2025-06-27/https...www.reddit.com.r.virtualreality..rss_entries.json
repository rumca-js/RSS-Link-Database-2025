I did search up that to keep your headset charge up for a long time you need a charger that is 15v but I have one that&#39;s 18v but doesnt really do much. I do have a INIU cable but it doesnt really do anything. But yeah I want to play for hours and hours but can&#39;t any help?

I was fortunate enough to be able to grab a 5090 FE last month through a friend, and one of the games that&#39;s eaten up a lot of my time since then has been Cyberpunk 2077 with Luke Ross&#39; R.E.A.L. VR mod. I bought the game at launch, but my RX 6800 couldn&#39;t do it justice, so I&#39;d shelved it until the upgrade. But now that I can finally max the settings out, both on flatscreen and in VR, I&#39;m finally starting to see what all the hype was about!</p> <p>One of the things that&#39;s really impressed me about the mod is that, with a bit of tweaking, I was able to get it running maxed out at 80fps with path tracing. Even though I know CP2077 wasn&#39;t designed for VR, it&#39;s still incredible seeing something look that good in a headset!
