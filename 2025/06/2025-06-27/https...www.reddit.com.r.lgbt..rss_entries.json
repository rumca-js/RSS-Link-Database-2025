It just pisses me off how she doesn&#39;t seem to accept me. She tries her best and I get that, but saying stuff like this just makes me feel like shit and makes me feel invalid, and actually also make my self doubts worse. She says she works with trans people and she is fine with it, but she seems to be using any opportunity to shove this idea that im not trans in my face. I hate this and I hate that she&#39;s going to be one of the more accepting people on her side of my family.
