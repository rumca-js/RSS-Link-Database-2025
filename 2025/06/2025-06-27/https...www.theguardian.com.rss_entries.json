So it is with NZO, a mysterious Sheffield-based electronic artist whose album Come Alive is a defibrillating jolt of vitality. You can find affinities with other artists and styles here, for sure: the bookish but playful minimalism of another Sheffield musician, Mark Fell; Objekt\u2019s trickster vision for bass music and techno; the white-tiled cleanliness of some of Sophie\u2019s work; Jlin\u2019s paradoxically static funk. But the way it\u2019s all pulled together is totally NZO\u2019s, making for music that\u2019s so light ",

So while they were clearly a pivotal moment in British history, it\u2019s a challenge to find a point of difference. Liza Williams\u2019s series benefits from taking a considered view of how the attacks felt to British Muslims and also hears from former PM Tony Blair and Eliza Manningham-Buller, director general of MI5 at the time of the attacks. The big-picture insights are fascinating, but it\u2019s the tiny details \u2013 such as the first responder who, out of respect, resolved to move victims\u2019 bodies \u201cas if they were asleep\u201d \u2013 that really stick in the mind. <em><br>\n  Netflix, from Tuesday 1 July</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025",
