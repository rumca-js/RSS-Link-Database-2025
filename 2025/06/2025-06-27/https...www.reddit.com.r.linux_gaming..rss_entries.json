I would really love it cause everything else about my mouse is perfect and I couldn&#39;t be happier.

I was experimenting with this game and finally got it launch in a Wayland session vs XWayland. CS2 has an option to do this but no love for Left 4 Dead 2 for some reason. After scouring the net, I came across some launch options that work. However, there are a few caveats. One, this works best/only with Vulkan. In OpenGL, it will work but it performs very poorly and there are graphical bugs/glitches. Two, with Vulkan and you want to use Vsync, you will need to set the game to fullscreen, which puts it in FIFO mode, but this raises the black level (Nvidia issue?). To get the blacks correct, you will have to use Borderless but this puts it in Immediate mode which disables Vsync so you are going to have to make a choice, Vsync or Color Accuracy.</p> <p>Anyway, here are the launch options below. Please let me know if you have any information that you would like to shar",
