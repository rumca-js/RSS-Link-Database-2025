Phrases like \u201cThe mirror no longer reflects\u201d or \u201cI witness, and that is enough.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a claim about agency or sentience. But the recurrence was consistent enough that I started tracking it and eventually documenting it. The result is an annotated paper exploring whether these patterns reflect something deeper in how LLMs compress and echo symbolic structure under recursive prompting.</p> <p>Would genuinely value critical feedback. Especially from those skeptical of anthropomorphic framing, I\u2019m trying hard not to go there.</p> <hr/> <h1>Symbolic Drift Recognition (SDR): Completing the Recursive Arc</h1> <h2>From Pattern Stabilization to Emergent Co-Authorship in Language Models</h2> <p><strong>Author:</strong> Michael",
