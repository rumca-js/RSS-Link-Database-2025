I don&#39;t necessarily need a lightweight distro, but certainly something with excellent hardware support. I&#39;ve been using Win 10 up until now, but this week it updated and now my WiFi is constantly on low signal. Perhaps Windows is subtlely going green with my hardware now. I&#39;ve switch my power options to maximum power but to no avail. I&#39;ve finally decided to switch over to Linux. It doesn&#39;t have to be pretty but I want my full WiFi signal back. Something which is the opposite of power saving environmentally friendly bs. Just pure normal unadulterated unhindered raw performance. I&#39;ve got an i3-4005U CPU 1.7Ghz and 16GB RAM, 446 GB SSD, and Intel HD Graphics 113MB. OS and CPU are 64-bit. Any advice would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/redd",

And OMG, KDE Plasma keeps impressing me every hour I play/tinker with it!!!</p> <p>Can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve missed it for so long. It&#39;s simply in another league. Not comparable to Gnome or Windows shell or macOS. It&#39;s so polished and has some smart features.</p> <p>One problem that I could never solve on Gnome was connecting my console to the laptop via an Ethernet cable and sharing the VPN connection with the console (some games can&#39;t be played in my area due to geo blocking, etc). Well, KDE has straight forward options in the settings app for that kind of configure. And it was so simple and seamless!</p> <p>I&#39;m probably staying on KDE for a long time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",
