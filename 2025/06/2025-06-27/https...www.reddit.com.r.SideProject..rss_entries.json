It&#39;s an open-source, self-hostable app that gives you full control over your files with a clean, modern UI. GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/Phoenix-XShare\">https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/Phoenix-XShare</a> Key Features: * Modern UI &amp; PWA support * User-controlled encryption toggle * Node.js, Express, &amp; MongoDB stack This was a complete v2.0 rewrite and a huge learning experience. The project is free and open-source. I&#39;d love to get feedback from fellow builders on the concept or any features you think are missing.

No more wondering when the HVAC filter was last replaced, or who actually took out the trash last week. With Chores, everyone in the house stays on the same page and maybe even has fun doing it.</p> <p>The app makes chore management easy and flexible. You can create a household, invite members, and start assigning tasks right away. Whether it\u2019s something recurring like laundry every Saturday, or a one-off like cleaning the gutters, Chores handles it all. Set up any recurrence you want: daily, every 3 days, biweekly, or totally custom.</p> <p>You can even add rewards to tasks, so you can add that extra incentive to make sure that a task gets completed!</p> <p>Le",

Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if you had thousands of users waiting to use your app on launch day?</p> <p>I am a disabled veteran. I would like to see an app where I can follow your project from idea to launch, check on its status, and try it out for you and give you feedback. </p> <p>It would even be cool if I liked the idea and progress to be able to pitch in a few bucks for your hosting or whatever.</p> <p>Why? Because I want people to try my future apps out too. I am not a developer. I once paid a developer to create a beautiful app thinking if I build it they will come. You guys already know that was my first mistake.</p> <p>So this time around, I would like to give 1,000 projects 10 minutes of my time fully exploring their apps, giving sincere feedback, and using and/or sharing with others if I like it. And then; when it&#39;s my turn, I would like 1,000 people to do this for me.</p> <p>That&#39;s like basically investing 5-6 weeks (ar",
