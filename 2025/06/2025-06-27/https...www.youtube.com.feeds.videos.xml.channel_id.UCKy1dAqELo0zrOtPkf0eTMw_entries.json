New games and cycles of trauma drive home the cruelty of this universe in novel ways, and Lee Jung-jae wraps up his iconic portrayal of\u00a0 Gi-hun in stunning fashion. Some of season 3\u2019s twists manage to cleverly (and punishingly) illustrate the long-lasting ripple effects of a capitalist hellscape while others, like expanded roles for the wealthy VIPs watching and wagering on the games, add unnecessary noise. This final chapter isn't without flaws, but it still delivers the suspense and cinematic polish that made Squid Game a hit in the first place.\n\n#IGN",
