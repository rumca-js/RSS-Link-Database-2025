I then tried crDroid, but again my phone isn&#39;t listed... So I don&#39;t really know what OS to use from here and if there even is anything good for my phone.

To me this is a big step because, as someone who knows a lot of people in the tech industry, email is considered to be extremely STICKY. This means that the barriers which exist to switching stop people from every changing. It follows that the best thing I can do for people (using these notes) is to make that first bit as easy as possible.

My girlfriend, my friend and myself are all on the same plan. Been that way since 2018. The price is honestly unbeatable for 3 people with unlimited data. There&#39;s just no way for me to convince them to switch with me when they have established everything on this plan. What should I do? If I did end up installing grapheneOS I would have to install the Googlefi app to download my eSIM. Or could I get Google to send me a physical SIM card? Thoughts?

The phone is an Alcatel Pixi Glory Onetouch A621BL. It currently runs Android 5.1 Lollipop. Now I\u2019m not trying to use it as my main phone or anything, but I\u2019d like to do something anything with it.
