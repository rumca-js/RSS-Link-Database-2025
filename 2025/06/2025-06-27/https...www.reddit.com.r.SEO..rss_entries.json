However, on Google Search results, it still displays the default WordPress logo.</p> <p>It&#39;s been a few days now, and I\u2019ve already submitted the site for reindexing via Google Search Console. I also cleared the cache and double-checked that the favicon is properly linked in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of my site.</p> <p>Has anyone dealt with this before? How long does it usually take for Google to update favicons in search results? Is there anything else I can do to speed up the process or make sure it updates properly?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/achilles205\"> /u/achilles205 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1llscy9/why_is_my_favicon_still_not_updating_on_google/\">[link]</a></span>",
