Kill Human Content Creation?\" /></p>On this edition of HEY DT:<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:21 I'm really enjoying your new Video Man Pages series...how many commands in total do you plan to cover?<br />1:36 You recommended that people start a YouTube channel, but isn't A.I. going to outcompete human-generated content?<br />4:23 Have you heard about a book called \u201cThe courage to be disliked\u201d? You might find it relatable.<br />7:28 Is DTOS stable enough to install on physical hardware yet? <br />8:48 You clickbaited me with that thumbnail. Putting Safari in \"great\" tier and \"Brave in \"meh\" had me triggered.<br />10:12 While I don't enjoy doomscrolling, I do believe in social responsibility. Ignorance is what got us here.<br />12:40 I know you mainly use Linux, but have you ever messed with FreeDOS?<br />14:31 Is Emacs a text editor or an operating system?<br />18:01 Thanks to Pat",
