This difficult decision was made due to a combination of factors: the project&#39;s metadata has become unusable, we no longer have the time to remake or repair it, and the community effort to transition to using Open Library as the source has stalled without much progress.</p> <p>Third-party metadata mirrors exist, but as we&#39;re not involved with them at all, we cannot provide support for them. Use of them is entirely at your own risk. The most popular mirror appears to be rreading-glasses.</p> <p>Without anyone to take over Readarr development, we expect it to wither away, so we still encourage you to seek alternatives to Readarr.</p> <p>Key Points: Effective Immediately: The retirement takes effect immediately.

I made sure to change only the number of souls . I did not tamper with anything else , a video told me exact variable I would get . After getting the souls and leveling up I closed the game , there was nothing out of order ,no lag no nothing but when I reopened the game , the game no longer starts it either says <em>not responding</em> or just do nothing . Please tell me of a fix. I am not a professional an am unable to deal with this .
