GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/Phoenix-XShare\">https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/Phoenix-XShare</a> Here&#39;s a quick look at the features: * Host it yourself: Your files, your server. No third-party snooping. * Encryption: files are being encrypted after uploading. * Modern UI &amp; PWA: Clean, responsive interface that installs like a native app. * Simple Setup: Uses the local filesystem for storage, no complex dependencies. * Efficient Stack: Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The project is MIT licensed and community-driven. We&#39;re looking for feedback and contributors to help build it out further. Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pheonix2008\"> /u/Pheonix2008 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

By forcing external contributors to sign over copyright to the project maintainers, the maintainers don&#39;t have the same obligations to external contributors and users as external contributors have to the maintainers. This creates a power imbalance that is radically opposed to the spirit of open source, while masquerading as open source using a FOSS license (often the AGPLv3). Despite the license, project maintainers can take the code proprietary any time they want, since all the copyright has been signed over to them. External contributors on the other hand are bound by the copyleft and have no rights to future versions of the software if the maintainer decides to take the code proprietary. As you can see, the power imbalance is significant.</p> <p>This doesn&#39;t apply when the CLA is used alongside a permissive license (",
