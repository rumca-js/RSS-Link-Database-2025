You might find it relatable.\n7:28 Is DTOS stable enough to install on physical hardware yet? \n8:48 You clickbaited me with that thumbnail. Putting Safari in \"great\" tier and \"Brave in \"meh\" had me triggered.\n10:12 While I don't enjoy doomscrolling, I do believe in social responsibility. Ignorance is what got us here.\n12:40 I know you mainly use Linux, but have you ever messed with FreeDOS?\n14:31 Is Emacs a text editor or an operating system?\n18:01 Thanks to Patrons\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n\ud83d\udcb0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n\ud83d\udcb3 Paypal: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=channel_banner&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazNocEhiaGFBT1l1MnRHbnlIcHFKbXJW",
