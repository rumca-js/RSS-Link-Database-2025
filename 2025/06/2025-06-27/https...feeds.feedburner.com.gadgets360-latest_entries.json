        "description": "In June 2024, a mysterious 30-nanosecond radio burst baffled scientists \u2014 until they traced it back to a surprising source: Relay 2, a NASA satellite offline since 1967. Researchers believe the signal could have been triggered either by a micrometeorite impact or an electrostatic discharge. The discovery, detailed in a new preprint study, highlights how defunct satellites may still interact with space conditions. Experts say the incident could offer a new method for detecting electrostatic discharges from aging satellites and space debris in crowded orbits.",

Using a coronagraph to block starlight, Webb identified the planet embedded in the star\u2019s dusty ring system. TWA 7\u202fb is the smallest exoplanet ever imaged directly. The discovery highlights Webb\u2019s unprecedented precision and paves the way for imaging even smaller, potentially Earth-like planets with future observatories equipped with next-generation coronagraphs and infrared imaging instruments.",
