Based on both critical and Steam review response, Supermoves is a blast, combining Mirror's Edge-inspired freerunning with some cool multiplayer modes. However, the game did not sell particularly well, and developer Makea Games was forced to shut down back in April.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a0SDDAIds\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9a0SDDAIds\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"",

In addition, Bub can utilize special bubbles--like fire and water--to take out enemies.
