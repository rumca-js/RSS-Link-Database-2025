        "description": "Epic Systems is the leading provider of electronic medical records in the U.S.\u2014but its headquarters in Wisconsin looks nothing like a typical tech campus. The HQ has five different campuses and some take cues from stories like \u2018Harry Potter,\u2019 \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 and \u2018Alice in Wonderland.\u2019 There are features like treehouses, yellow brick roads and even air-tagged sheep. WSJ visited Epic\u2019s HQ to figure out why this medical record company built its version of Disneyland in Wisconsin. \n\n#Epic #Office #Shorts",
