I love a good world building book where you need a really good imagination to understand it. Now the most important part is TRAGEDY! I love a good death but better yet, betrayal. My favorite troupe is friends to enemies like Anakin and Ahsoka, Vi and Jinx, Darrow and Roque/Cassius. I also need a romance subplot, preferably a slow burn (Jim and Pam). I also really like books with horribly sad endings that make you hate the rest of the book.
