I&#39;ve been learning and in the process of trial and error, I&#39;ve found certain areas of cybersecurity to be more interesting than others, more specifically blue teaming (SOC analyst,etc.) and network security, but the thing is I feel like barriers to these two are high, even internships are hard to get, in general i think blue teaming has a higher barrier of entry. That&#39;s where red team comes in, the barrier of entry is definitely low but it is pretty hard to even get decent at it, I&#39;ve been trying on almost all platforms HTB, THM and MetaCTF, doing CTFS but I&#39;ve really found it to be hard to complete even the ones labeled &quot;very easy&quot;. So I&#39;m not sure what to really do rn, I would love to do blue teaming but these companies really do ask alot even for basic internships \ud83e\udd72</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",

In our day-to-day life we don\u2019t usually do development in our team but am someone who likes it so I propose some project and working on it. Basically I do development and driving security and compliance review for same (just for context). </p> <p>Now am going through internal job applying where it would be officially development and research work. I had a talk with hiring manager and my profile really matches with Job Description. Hiring Manager told role wouldn\u2019t be full fledged developing role as it will involve security research and development which is what am currently doing in my current role. </p> <p>The problem is I do development but as we know when it comes to interview, they ask those leetcode things. I really don\u2019t expect that they will ask some medium or hard coding task as it\u2019s research role but I feel like atleast I should prepare for easy leetcode questions. <",
