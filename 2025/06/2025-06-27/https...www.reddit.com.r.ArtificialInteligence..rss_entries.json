Through the lens of Einstein\u2019s mass-energy equivalence (E=mc\u00b2), we argue that information storage and processing events create measurable gravitational effects that accumulate across cosmic scales.</p> <h2>Core Theoretical Framework</h2> <h3>The iPod Thought Experiment: Information as Mass</h3> <p>The foundation of this theory rests on a deceptively simple question: which weighs more\u2014an empty iPod or one filled with 10,000 songs?

However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations und",

I\u2019m smart, and want to use my brain for my career. When i say this, i mean i would genuinely like being a quantum mathematician, or an economic theorist. The problem is I can easily see ai taking these jobs. </p> <p>What jobs, if any, are you 100% confident AI won\u2019t take, that is still a computing job. It seems ridiculous to think there are any when you work it that way but i\u2019m desperate here. Maybe someone is considering something i\u2019m not.

Alot of people are afraid of AI videos/pictures becoming so indistinguishable from actual videos and pictures that it&#39;s used for bad instead of good. What if all AI had a hard coded thing in their software to just had some sort of imperfection to the image. Maybe a black bar somewhere or something. While it may limit the use of it for good but it also prevents alot of fake news from spreading if AI ever got good enough to make perfect videos. </p> <p>I am also not really well-versed in AI so if this is a dumb post I apologise.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mission_Possible_361\"> /u/Mission_Possible_361 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1llkip6/ai_video_making/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1llkip6/ai_video_making/\">[",
