It just can\u2019t happen. So if Apple\u2019s message to users is that they should trust Apple Wallet, and move more of their \u201cshit that goes in your wallet\u201d life from their traditional analog wallet into their digital Apple Wallet, that\u2019s the bar. No ads, ever. They\u2019re competing against the privacy and intimacy of one of the most personal things people carry with them.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just that many people find ads annoying, no matter where they appear. It\u2019s that Apple Wallet ought to be sacrosanct\u2009\u2014\u2009like the Passwords and Journal apps",
