Once I get to the page I care about, I need software that will identify every time the text &quot;Appellate Transcript&quot; appears, click on the text which will open a popup, click on the &quot;download file&quot; button in the popup, close the popup, and then click on the next &quot;Appellate Transcript&quot; and repeat. </p> <p>I&#39;ve found some solutions that are too complicated for this task, and some that can&#39;t do it at all.
