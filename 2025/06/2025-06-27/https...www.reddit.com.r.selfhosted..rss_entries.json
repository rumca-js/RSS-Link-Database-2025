I have a few older servers and a rather high end desktop (9950x and 4080) (server, dual Xenon E5-2699V4, with 256gb ram each and dual K80 gpus).</p> <p>What I have is around 50k old (turn of last century) technical drawings that where digitized from microfilm. And now I need to name each file the same as the drawing number (ex: C12-568), extra bonuses would be if it can separate the scans that have multiple drawings per image, and straighten the drawings that are slightly rotated. But even just naming them would save me massive amounts of time. Is there anything that&#39;s open source that does this sort of thing? Or on the cheaper end of things to use?
