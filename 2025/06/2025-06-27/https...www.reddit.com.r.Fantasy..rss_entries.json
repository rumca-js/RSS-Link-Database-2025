So instead, I went with an adaptation of my favorite video game series: the famously bad Legend of Zelda TV show from 1989.

As in they&#39;re treated as actual skills, not just some nebulous concept of charisma. Just like any other skill, charisma is something that can be learned and taught. The way that Cain manipulates his troops is written the same way as his martial prowess. As in not overly detailed or specific but written that you still get the sense of Cain&#39;s skill. this is absolutely fascinating to me. As an autistic nerd, social acumen is as mystical and strange as any magic. I crave a book like this with a focus on the intricacies of human interaction. To experience things I consider impossible is why I read fantasy. I would prefer if the book had a focus on politics and world building and less on action.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TALA1996\"> /u/TALA1996 </a>",

But the source of magic is dead witches and wizards. All children are screened for magical aptitude. If you\u2019re magical, you get sent to a magic academy. But you don\u2019t learn any spells (learning spells is in fact illegal), the entire purpose of the academy is to maximize your magical potential so that when you die the empire can extract as much magical energy from your body as possible. The empire pays you a pension for life after graduating based on how useful your dead body will be to them. The lowest might power street lights or appliances, the highest will power entire cities and military facilities.</p> <p>Any other stories have a similarly grim depiction of magic?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
