        "description": "Pirate Software (an ex Blizzard Developer and prominent streamer) has recently faced a barrage of criticism over a series of situations in which he found himself on the wrong side of the internet mob. Some deserved, some not as much... he has found himself rapidly becoming a lolcow, and the subject of hostility from a growing portion of the online world.\n\nIn a lot of ways, the internet loves to have villains, but I think its important to understand that the defense mechanism of someone subjected to widespread harassment may not be the best thing to make that situation stop, and I see similarities with Pirate Software handling of these events compared to my own career on YouTube, and the techniques/mistakes I used and made in my earlier years on the platform.\n\n\nTHE STOP KILLING GAMES PETITION: https://www.stopkillinggames.com/\n\n\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/U",
