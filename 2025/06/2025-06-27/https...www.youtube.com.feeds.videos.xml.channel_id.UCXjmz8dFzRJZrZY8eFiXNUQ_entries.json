        "description": "There\u2019s no question \u2014 without Iron Man, there would be no Marvel Cinematic Universe. Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s portrayal of Tony Stark changed superhero movies forever. But what many fans don\u2019t know is that Iron Man almost didn\u2019t happen at all.\n\nBefore the 2008 blockbuster, Hollywood spent nearly a decade trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to bring Tony Stark to the big screen. With multiple studios, directors, and rewrites, the project stalled again and again. So what was holding Iron Man back? And how did Marvel finally pull it off?\n\n#ironman #tonystark #marvel #mcu #nerdstalgic",
