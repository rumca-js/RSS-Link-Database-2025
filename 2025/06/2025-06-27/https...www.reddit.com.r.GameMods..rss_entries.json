That is why I would like to ask: </p> <p>How you decide to create a new map or campaign for a game and how the developer of the game could support you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZDeveloper\"> /u/ZDeveloper </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1llpzx4/how_you_decide_for_which_game_you_create_a_user/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1llpzx4/how_you_decide_for_which_game_you_create_a_user/\">[comments]</a><",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently downloaded dark souls 3 , there was too much grinding for little reward so I download cheatengine (yes that is the name ) it is actually a simple data scanner,after scanning values (exact , dec/inc un/changed etc. ) I got to the number of souls (currency ) in the game . I made sure to change only the number of souls . I did not tamper with anything else , a video told me exact variable I would get . After getting the souls and leveling up I closed the game , there was nothing out of order ,no lag no nothing but when I reopened the game , the game no longer starts it either says <em>not responding</em> or just do nothing . Please tell me of a fix. I am not a professional an am unable to deal with this . </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Civil-Thought-8967\"> /u/Civil-Thought-8967 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1llpjgd/cheatenegineexe/\">[link]</a></span",
