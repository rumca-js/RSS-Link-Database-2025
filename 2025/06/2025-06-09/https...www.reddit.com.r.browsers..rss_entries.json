On YT, Ublock was not blocking ads at all. Sometimes the side ads show for a sec and then dissapear and other, if you pay attention to the player, some ads try to load, but can&#39;t and just shows a simple banner that you have to manually skip. I tried other filters a manual filters from internet, but no change at all. Other webs showing ads for a sec.</p> <p>Then i tried Adguard... directly not working on YT, full Ads on new videos. Another webs works better and not shows a single ad, but YT... </p> <p>Firefox with Ublock is working 10/10. </p> <p>The thing is: Anyone is experiencing similar things with MS Edge or is just me having bad luck/getting Microsoft&#39;d? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
