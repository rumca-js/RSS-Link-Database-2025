If we&#39;re both shopping we want to be able to edit the list and have it sync between us. I.e. if me and the wife are out shopping and I pick up the milk I want to tick that on the list and have it update on her device. Or if she knows I&#39;m headed to the store she can add things and I&#39;ll see them when I open the list.</p> <p>Every replacement for Keep that I find either don&#39;t have the synchronisation of a list between multiple users, or it is a massive project management tool that does all kinds of things we do not need. We&#39;re both on Android and about to make the move to /e/OS. Self-hosting some kind of service for the sync with docker is fine or even preferable but if I have to tech my wife markup och how do use a project management tool to make a shopping list it&#39;s probably not what we&#39;re looking ",
