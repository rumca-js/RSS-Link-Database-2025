Her authentic lilt won me over and provided a perfect voice to a family of southern women. </p> <p>I kind of &quot;hybrid&quot; read this, listening to about 60% of it when I wasn&#39;t able to sit down with the book. Not only did the narration match the experience of reading it but I truly think it was BETTER, which I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever experienced before. I guess the narrator makes all the difference. </p> <p>Anyway the book itself blew me away and I would recommend it in either form.

I like Vienna and descriptive nature of the novel. I\u2019m also intrigued by eerie, dream-like narrative of finding a missing husband. Bein told by your neigbhor that she saw your husband on news report about a fire in a small Austrian village while she\u2019s asking you to accompany her teenage son to Vienna has a strange, old time, ghost-like quality to it with a blend of modern contemporary domesticity: Husband who keeps a secret, possible infedility? Navigating a foreign country and forming a bond with an all-too curious teenager in your care. </p> <p>I take the novel is a vacation mystery? Domestic thriller? Hints of possible romance. I\u2019m loving the dark, emotionally guarded nature and the threatening undertone of the narrative.
