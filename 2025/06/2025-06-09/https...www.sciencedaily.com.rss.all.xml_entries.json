        "description": "A new Rutgers Health study reveals a surprising twist in the antibiotic resistance story: instead of simply killing bacteria, drugs like ciprofloxacin can actually trigger a kind of microbial survival mode. By crashing the bacteria's energy levels, the antibiotic causes E. coli to ramp up its metabolism, survive attacks, and mutate faster ultimately accelerating the evolution of drug resistance.",

The double-blind trial revealed that NR not only safely boosted NAD+ levels but also improved cardiovascular health, reduced skin ulcers, and helped protect kidney function in patients.",

        "description": "For millions of years, large herbivores like mastodons and giant deer shaped the Earth's ecosystems, which astonishingly stayed stable despite extinctions and upheavals. A new study reveals that only twice in 60 million years did environmental shifts dramatically reorganize these systems once with a continental land bridge, and again with climate-driven habitat change. Yet the ecosystems adapted, with new species taking on old roles. Now, a third, human-driven tipping point threatens that ancient resilience.",
