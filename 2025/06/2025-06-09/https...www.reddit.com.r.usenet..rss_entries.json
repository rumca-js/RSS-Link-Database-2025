I&#39;m sitting on 10Gbps ISP with hardware that matches(Using NVME cache pool on Unraid, Unifi UDM SE router + Switch).</p> <p>It seems that my biggest bottleneck(as of right now) seem to be too many connections used simultaneously. I don&#39;t know if this is because of limitations in Docker on Unraid or if my router struggles with too many connections. No matter what, I&#39;ve noticed that if I enable above 200 connection in total, my download speed drops below optimal. </p> <p>So right now I&#39;m looking for the provider that can give me the best DL speed per connection, to see how high I can go for shits and giggles. ;)</p> <p>My max DL has been a sustained ~330-350 MB/s using:<br/> - Frugal EU server 100 connections (~2.5 MB/s per connection)<br/> - Newshosting EU 100 connections (~1 MB/s per connection)</p> <p>So, any tips on fast providers for EU?
