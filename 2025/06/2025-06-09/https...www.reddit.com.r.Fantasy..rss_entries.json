I\u2019ll try to be honest and count something niche even in my own language. <br/> - The \u201cauthor of color\u201d is such a strange idea for me. I\u2019m French, and I&#39;ve never once in my life chosen a book with this idea in mind. And here I am, looking at pictures of authors that have foreign names to see if they could be \u201cof color\u201d enough, and it feels wrong. I know it\u2019s a cultural thing, but still, I\u2019ll probably use the substitution joker for this one.<br/> - When I find a book I like, I usually read other books by the same author, so the \u201conly one book per author\u201d rule is a bit restrictive to me.

Personally, his Cthulhu Armageddon series is my favorite for fantasy, even with Weredeer and the United States of Monster series of books, as this one takes place in a far distant future that has been entirely reshaped by fantastical and horror elements. Originally, I posted this review to <a href=\"http://Shoggoth.net\">Shoggoth.net</a> (worked there for a bit), but I am reposting for Pride month.

For those who remember me, it\u2019s great to see you again! For those who don\u2019t know me, my name is Krista D. Ball and I\u2019ve been known to hang out on this hell site for the past decade. Or more. Feels like more.</p> <p>I am currently running a Kickstarter to re-launch the first three books in a very old series of mine: Tranquility. <em>Blaze</em> has been rewritten, expanded, and revised from the 2012 edition. <em>Grief</em> and <em>Fury</em> has new revisions and additions, including entire new scenes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tranquility-series1/tranqu",

I wondered if anyone could recommend a fantasy book/series with a focus on soliders or knights and soliders life/feelings/place in society? I&#39;m not much of a fantasy buff and have not read much, but I read a fanfic that touched upon the roles of knights and soliders in a very interesting way, and I wanted to read more about it. I&#39;m not overly interested in warfare or grand scale battles (although these things being featured is not a problem), I am just more interested in the personal lives and struggles of individuals.

Since the date is decently close (August 21st, 2025) and there isn&#39;t any cover yet, nor any post from the author about it, I&#39;m hesitant to believe it is real. Does anyone have any further info that could make that date feasible? I&#39;m really looking forward to the book so I would immediately preorder if that was the case, but I&#39;m not trusting it at the moment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/franrodalg\"> /u/franrodalg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l6xnr7/preorders_open_for_an_august_21st_release_of_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l6xnr7/preorde",

Life can hit you like a truck sometimes and it was nearly a decade of just some non-fiction books before I re-read ASOIAF and remembered that commuting time can be a great place to read and life can get a tad bit better with that (specially when your work doesn&#39;t leave you time for anything else). Was reading The Expanse, the first three books had peaks and valleys and when at the end of Abbadon&#39;s Gate I was more relieved that the story was finally over than thrilled, I noticed it was time to swap and put The Expanse in the shelf a bit, to get me re-excited. </p> <p>Had a run-in with The Blade Itself and was a bit disappointed, even after all the praise. I wrote in other posts the reasoning and it is not the goal of the post anyway (maybe in the future I do get back to The First Law and will love it this time). I almos",
