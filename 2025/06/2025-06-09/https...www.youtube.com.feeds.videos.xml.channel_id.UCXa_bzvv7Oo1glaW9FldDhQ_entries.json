        "description": "Summer Game Fest has revealed Resident Evil Requiem, the next mainline entry in its survival horror series, and for very good reason, people are more than a little excited about it. \n\nThough this year's Summer Game Fest showcase itself probably wasn't the best, RE Requiem's reveal was a highlight that did elevate the whole affair at least a little bit. Of course, there's still plenty that we don't know about the game yet, but based on what has been officially revealed, we've already got a wishlist in our heads, as we're sure many other fans do as well- and here, that's exactly what we're going to talk about.",

Welcome aboard to one of the best and most memorable experiences you are likely to get from a game. Enjoy Yakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut, and hopefully this is the start of bringing the rest of the franchise over to Nintendo so that the rest of those games can be enjoyed by these new fans. \n\nAnd if every one of those games comes to the Switch 2, which they absolutely should, given how much more powerful the system is you\u2019ll be in for a time like no other.",

        "description": "On the whole, Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is a great version of a game that has by now become a truly fantastic and legendary experience. It\u2019s good to see that Cyberpunk 2077 survived the transition to Nintendo as lot better than the Witcher 3 did. This is a version that can be recommended on its own merits, rather than being one that you should only play if you have access to none of the other ones. \n\nIt\u2019s a little worse looking and performing than the other console versions, but it holds its own well, outperforms most of its portable peers, and also leverages a bunch of the Nintendo Switch 2\u2019s features.",
