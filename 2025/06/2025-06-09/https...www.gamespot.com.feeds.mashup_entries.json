Mario Kart World, the banner game for the launch of the Switch 2, carries with it the expectation that of course this will be one of the games most associated with the system for its entire lifespan. The challenge was crafting a new game that felt sufficiently suited to carry those expectations. Due to its blend of skillful mechanical tweaks, lovely aesthetics, and a general design philosophy built around delightful surprises, this one will go the distance.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest standout feature of Mario Kart World--the one that its name, identity, and many of its mechanics revolve around--is the world itself. For the first time in the series history the races aren't built as standalone tracks, but rather as part of a large contiguous map. Iconic lo",

Outside of having a display that doesn't feature all the hallmarks required for an accurate HDR experience, its HDR configuration menu initially seems lacking. That's a mistake, it seems, with Nintendo hiding a vital setting behind a confusing UI choice.</p><p>When configuring the Nintendo Switch 2 with an HDR-compliant display, you're initially greeted with a familiar screen that lets you adjust the maximum peak brightness level the console will output. Once you've finished setting that point, the Switch 2 transitions to what initially just seems like an image to demo the changes you've just made. That isn't the case, however, with the screen containing an \"Adjust Brightness\" slider that you can access by hitting Y, which is more important than you might think.</p><p>This brightness slider actually controls the paper white point of the image, which is used as a referenc",

It's reminiscent of the first game's intro until you realize this isn't the murky wasteland of the first game, but a desert, teeming with creatures the realms of the living and dead.
