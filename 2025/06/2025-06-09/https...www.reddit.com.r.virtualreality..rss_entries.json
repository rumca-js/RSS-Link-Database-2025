How does everyone feel they compare? </p> <p>My rankings so far:</p> <ol> <li><p>Assassins Creed Nexus. Fantastic pacing, actually feels like you\u2019re in medieval Europe. The puzzles don\u2019t get boring unlike Behemoth and AW2. Even has a big army battle near the end. The only vr game I\u2019ve played with towns and cities filled with NPCs (even if most of them were clones of each other and speaking with the wrong accent).</p></li> <li><p>Batman: Arkham Shadow. Has all the good things AC Nexus does, apart from the setting. Loved the beginning, but the majority of the game is in prison. If I wanted to go to prison I\u2019d just go steal something, you know?</p></li> <li><p>Asguards Wrath 2. Big, beautiful grand world. Though I preferred the setting of the first Asguard\u2019s Wrath, something about the Norse setting felt more engaging. The puzzles get boring. Feels lonely, needs more friendly NPCs.</p></li> <li><p>Beh",

Try a bunch of free stuff that was new. Never really play or finish any games. I also think this has to do with there being so much free content on Quest. There\u2019s always something free to try even if it\u2019s not that good.</p> <p>Then on PCVR my pattern was more like never really finishing any games because so many of them are early access and unfinished. Just play it whenever I see an update.</p> <p>PSVR2 feels like gaming roots to me. The games are complete. And not only am I finishing them. I plan to finish them on the highest difficulty just to squeeze every drop out of it. It\u2019s a very old school gaming feeling.</p> <p>That\u2019s another thing I like about PSVR2.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Strict_Yesterday1649\"> /u/Strict_Yesterday1649 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vir",
