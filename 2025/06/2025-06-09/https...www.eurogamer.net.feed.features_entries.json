Caveat: I don't think I've ever truly loved Mario Kart since one magical evening at university in which a bunch of us played <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-64\">Mario Kart 64</a>, then newly released, on split-screen all night long and into the morning. I loved that game so much - each moment was such a hectic joy. And it used me up a bit. I haven't really been able to engage with the series with quite the same thrill since.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-know-how-good-mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-actually-is-but-its-perfect-for-me\">Read more</a></p>",
