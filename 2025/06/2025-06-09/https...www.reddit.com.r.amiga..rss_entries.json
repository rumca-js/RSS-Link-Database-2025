After the hugely novel polygonal 3D of Robocop 3, AB3D felt hugely advanced despite having shockingly poor resolution. The sound effects, level design and smoothness made up for it. </p> <p>In more recent years, getting into Amiga emulation let me dabble with AB3D again, although it was fiddly and would crash early in the last level. </p> <p>Then last year I discovered the faithful PC remake Project Osiris, which perfectly recreated the experience of all the levels, with improved resolution. Again, I became obsessed, and replayed the last level a ridiculous amount of times. </p> <p>I bought a Quest 3 headset last year, and today discovered that Project Osiris can be downloaded within the amazing QuestZDoom app. WOW. I&#39;ve been dreaming of this for over thirty years, but it was exactly as I always hoped it would be. Playing AB3D in VR has been one of those rare, lifetime memory gaming experience",
