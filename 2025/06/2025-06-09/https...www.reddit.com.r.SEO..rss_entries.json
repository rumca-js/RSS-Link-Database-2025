It indexes top of the funnel and more commercial stuff like competitor comparisons etc. just fine. </p> <p>However, as soon as I try to get service landing pages, or actual product pages indexed, it refuses to even touch these pages. Normally when I request Indexing, pages get indexed overnight, but it&#39;s been few days and nothing. Oddly enough sone older service pages are Indexed fine. Live URL tests are fine of course. It seems like Google refuses to even crawl the pages, as they come up as unknown to Google. </p> <p>I have few theories:</p> <ol> <li><p>As soon as the word &quot;Service&quot; is mentioned in headings, Google immediately requires far higher site authority to index those pages.

It doesn\u2019t look like that many words and it does have visuals so it doesn\u2019t look bad at all. I use Wix and I wanted to trim it down and put half the content into different pages for faster loading speeds as Wix sucks at that. However I\u2019ve read that 1000-1500 is optimal.
