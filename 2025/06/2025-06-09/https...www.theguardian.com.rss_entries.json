I\u2019d done a concert for CND [the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament], so we started talking about doing some sort of festival to raise the money. My younger brother Bill suggested it had to be pop. An agency in London gave Ronnie a list of acts including the Pretty Things, the Move, Fairport Convention, Tyrannosaurus Rex and an American act, Jefferson Airplane. We only had a \u00a3750 investment from the Isle of Wight Indoor Swimming Pool Association, but after a friend lent us his \u00a31,000 army pay-off, we managed to book all those bands, sell 10,000 tickets and break even. In the interim, the pool association pulled out because it didn\u2019t like the publicity about hippies, drugs and sex, but they allowed us to use their investment and we were able to pay them back.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theg",

While cold water immersion does activate the body, that\u2019s not the same as strengthening the immune system. \u201cWhen you immerse yourself in cold water, your body undergoes the cold shock response,\u201d says Tipton. \u201cYou get rapid breathing, a spike in heart rate and a surge of stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.\u201d This may explain why people feel more alert or energised after a cold dip.
