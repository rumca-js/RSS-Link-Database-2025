Minexa handles the rest, no need to deal with CSS selectors, JavaScript rendering, or bot blockers. It even manages multithreading, captchas, and proxy rotation for you.</p> <p>The best part? You can build a scraper in under 2 minutes, and then reuse it across similar pages to extract data in seconds. I could go from zero to full dataset in minutes, no tech background needed.</p> <p>It is really fascinating how AI is transforming so many areas of tech, does anyone have any other recommendations of such No Code tool platforms for Web ",
