Last time this happened was with Monkey&#39;s Paw (from W.W. Jacobs) which is probably still one of my favorite things I&#39;ve ever read and I noticed a pattern. Both are short, both are fast paced and both have some horror elements, so I wanted to know if there&#39;s something similar to those two short stories that you think are definitely worth a shot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeferson_tm\"> /u/Jeferson_tm </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l7fext/fastpaced_horror_stories/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l7fext/fastpaced_horror_stories/\">[co",

My favorite genres of movies/tv shows are horror, sci-fi, and mystery. Any other genre is okay. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of romance, but I do enjoy cheesy kdramas occasionally. I prefer the enemies to lovers or forbidden love tropes when it comes to romance.

Something more complicated than children fairytales, when it comes to world building and adventures. Maybe with a little bit of comedy too. For example, there is an anime genre called &quot;Iyashikei&quot; (means &quot;healing&quot;) about characters living out peaceful lives in calming environments. Would be great also read something with little emphasis on romance, just subtle hints would be enough. Basically, I wish there were &quot;old adult&quot; books as opposed to more edgy and desperate young adult novels.

The book explores how we lose that connection, how external influences breach our inner space, and how to consciously build emotional resilience to stay rooted in who we are.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently offering Advance Reader Copies (ARCs) to anyone interested in reading the book before its official release. In return, I&#39;d love your honest feedback or a review (on Goodreads, Amazon, or wherever you usually share your thoughts).</p> <p>If this resonates with you or you\u2019re interested in emotional wellbeing, inner boundaries, or personal growth, please comment below or message me",
