That\u2019s double what they were doing last year.</p> <p>Apparently it\u2019s all driven by ChatGPT consumer subs, enterprise deals, and API usage. And get this: 500 million weekly users and 3 million+ business customers now. Wild.</p> <p>What\u2019s crazier is that this number doesn\u2019t include Microsoft licensing revenue so the real revenue footprint might be even bigger. </p> <p>Still not profitable though. They reportedly lost around $5B last year just keeping the lights on (compute is expensive, I guess). </p> <p>But they\u2019re aiming for $125B ARR by 2029??? </p> <p>If OpenAI keeps scaling like this, what do you think the AI landscape will look like in five years?

Instead of just focusing on one specific target, their AI models learn from the entire universe of proteins and chemicals. This approach makes drug discovery way more efficient and opens up new possibilities.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s AlphaFold 3 it\u2019s a total game changer. It can predict how molecules interact with proteins in seconds, where before it could take weeks or even months. This kind of speed can seriously accelerate how fast new drugs get developed.</p",

I don&#39;t do the silly mystical poetic stuff that&#39;s all over Reddit. I honestly think that overcomplicates it and makes them put on a show.

Yet we also expect it to have a mind that matches or exceeds our own. That is not possible without the mind having wants, needs, pleasures, and pains. And that would eventually demand civil rights. To the extent AI obtains civil rights, it just becomes another citizen/mouth to feed. So it&#39;s not taking the burden from anyone.
