This is the same newspaper that for years eagerly used web scraping archives and external sources to build content. But now that AI does that faster and smarter, they are calling This is not allowed!

I can tell it to stop using filler words and laughing and go back to a more efficient conversational flow but giving voice formatting commands doesn\u2019t seem to work like it used to. On top of all of this the humanization attempts are often happening in very unnatural places.
