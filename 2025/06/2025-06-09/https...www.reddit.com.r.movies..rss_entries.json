Examples would be POTC at Worlds End where the boy starts singing Hoist the Colours and then one by one, the other prisoners join in.

Mine would be Dolores Claiborne. I just love the way Kathy Bates plays a mother who loves her daughter no matter how muchthe daughter blames her for everything and shows how Dolores did everything for her daughter. Jennifer Jason Leigh was amazing as well playing the roll of emotionally mess up woman who had yet to face the trauma of her past. Really a deep good movie. Also read Kathy Bates said it was her favorite roll because of the non linear timeline of the story</p> <p>The other used to be before I got sober requiem for a dream. I used to love watching that movie again I was so obsessed with it the DVD I had of it I watched all the special features of including listening to the directors commentary over the movie. I loved it. But it also was the movie I loved to get high too so I cut it out of my life after I sobered up.</p> <p",
