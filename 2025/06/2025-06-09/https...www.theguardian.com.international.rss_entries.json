The posters are evidence of Chicago\u2019s activism, long history of protecting its rich immigrant communities and resistance to attempts by previous administrations to weaken their protections. But now, as Donald Trump continues to roll out unprecedented attacks on immigrants \u2013 notably increased detentions and deportations without due process \u2013 organizers are stretched thin and scrambling to expand traditional tools used in the fight for immigrant rights to accommodate ballooning needs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve be",
