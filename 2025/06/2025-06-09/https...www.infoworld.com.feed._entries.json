Whether mobile, cloud, or another technology trend, the platform that wins developers ends up owning the market. Microsoft learned this lesson with Windows and <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/2264488/what-is-the-net-framework-microsofts-answer-to-java.html\">.NET</a>, and AWS with cloud primitives, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDfjPEA4BUM\">detailed by Microsoft exec Scott Guthrie</a> in a fascinating recent interview. Today we\u2019re seeing the same dynamic in AI. Powerful models matter, sure, but the real prize will go to <a href=\"ht",
