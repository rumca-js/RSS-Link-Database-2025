        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Redditors. Last night I installed a program that is a possible rootkit. I was wondering a couple things because I want to know if I should worry -</p> <p>Two people convinced me to install and run this program and test it, however if it gains admininstrative access on your computer, I believe it can do insane things. I then remembered I never gave it admin access. So I was wondering,</p> <ol> <li>Can a rootkit give itself admin access?</li> <li>After I realized the program I installed was possibly malware or a rootkit, I proceeded to run a virus scan, restarted my PC to clean anything. It detected some viruses but it was from the file I downloaded. I removed it. Now nothing is detected.</li> <li>Also, I haven&#39;t gotten any signs of someone hacking me, so that&#39;s good. The only thing was the antivirus freaking out as it detected malware, but the site itself was a fisher (think of it like exploits) so it detected viruses.</li> </ol> <p>Eithe",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ok, obviously I know this is a scam but I just want to check what exactly it most likely was and if I should be worried. So I was browsing fandom.com which is usually pretty normal but occasionally had a lot of ads. Not usually shady though. However, I just got redirected to a website claiming I\u2019m the 5 billionth google search and saying I won some kind of prize. After a few seconds of trying to see what was going on I clicked out. I looked it up and a few people have gotten this same scam. I just want to check was this most likely the type of scam that was trying to get me to put in info or could just being on the website have downloaded some kind of malware? I\u2019m always a little paranoid about this stuff and just want to check if I\u2019m most likely fine. Also if it helps I\u2019m currently searching on an iPhone and I may be like one update behind I\u2019m not sure. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CoinManFan",
