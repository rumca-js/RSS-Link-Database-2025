We had fun with this one.\n\nFind CherryTree here: https://mycherrytree.com/\n\nFind our RTX 5060 review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jjxWRcp_0\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n\n00:00 - The CherryTree RTX 5027 POS\n01:27 - Recycling Broken Cards\n01:43 - Borg Cube Case\n03:00 - Tear-Down of the Pre-Built 5027\n07:15 - Inside the \"Video Card\"\n08:40 - Clever Solution\n09:36 - Fixing \"VRAM\"\n10:26 - System Memory and SOC\n13:52 - Benchmarks (lol)\n14:39 - Acoustic, Power, and Thermal Plan\n15:20 - Night Raid Performance\n16:07 - Power ",
