        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone, I have a raspberry pi 5 8 gb ram that is running 24/7 because I have some containers running such as pi hole \u2026, the raspberry gets quite hot so I purchased the active cooler and installed it on its designated pins. I struggled to understand how to actually activate the ven, what I do is run \u201csudo vcgencmd measure_temp\u201d to get the temperature, and then \u201csudo gpioset --mode=exit /dev/gpiochip4 45=0\u201d to activate the vent. The question is: is there a better way to do this, like a bash script designed to activate the vent once the computer reaches a temperature? Secondo: what is the ideal operational temperature for the raspberry? With the second question I mean the temperature that both maximise computational efficiency and longevity</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vroom_177\"> /u/Vroom_177 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1l73j72/vent_activation_",
