I would also most likely try to maintain a 1 in 1 out rule.</p> <p>See below the list from the video with my rough guess at the category :D I have included a link to my collection as it is currently. I intend to sell or gift the games I remove from the collection as I downsize.</p> <p>3MBG video - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75QuD2hl418\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75QuD2hl418</a></p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Category (roughly determined from video)</th> <th align=\"left\">3MBG pick</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Favourite</td> <td align=\"left\">Spirit Island</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Engine Builder</td> <td align=\"left\">Terraforming Mars</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Game for scumbags</td> <",
