Core features so far: \u2022 Start/stop a timer when working on a ticket \u2022 Auto-stops on PC inactivity, screen lock, or sleep \u2022 Works offline and syncs time when connection is restored \u2022 Automatically logs time to the Jira worklog field \u2022 Optionally connects to a web dashboard where managers/PMs can: \u2022 See who\u2019s working on what in real time \u2022 Track time per issue/sprint/user \u2022 Get daily/weekly reports</p> <p>The goal is to remove the friction of manual time tracking while keeping everything synced with Jira.</p> <p>Would this be useful to you or your team?

I\u2019m a technical founder, and while I can do some outreach, I\u2019m afraid of wasting too much potential by going too slow or not hitting the right channels.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear from others in the same situation: If you built your product first \u2013 how did you approach growth? Did you bring someone in? Pay for launch help? Or just keep grinding solo?</p> <p>Would love to learn from your experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HandsOnArch\"> /u/HandsOnArch </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1l70d3d/how_do_solo_builders_handle_growth_without/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"htt",

It also has the typical follow/like/comment features and live chat, profile pages, video upload, account pages with order history etc. It is designed mainly for a startup focusing on getting the art community to use it, but I want to make a separate version for myself that can have a completely different use. Do you have an idea what would make the greatest impact today with how current social media sites are censoring and shadow banning people? I can simplify it with less features like no e-commerce to make it fit with a current need.

I am new to iOS apps and wanted to try something fun as a side project and build an app that makes my life easier.<br/> I had recently moved from the US to a different country and found myself using Google all the time to convert measurements. Then i&#39;d have another tab to convert USD to the currency of the country i&#39;m in and then if I wanted to check what time it was back in the US, I&#39;d have to open the Clock app.<br/> It was annoying switching between all of these so I decided to create my own with all of these features. There are already some apps similar to mine on the market but I couldn&#39;t get used to the UI on them.</p> <p>Its not as impressive as most of the other apps on this site but I hope some of you will find it useful, especially when traveling!</p> <p>Would love to hear some feedback! </p> <p>Heres the App Store Link : <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/en/app/convertergo/id6746034629?l=en-GB\">https://apps.app",
