(UNFI), a major distributor serving over 30,000 North American retailers \u2014 including Whole Foods \u2014 has been struck by a cyberattack, leading to ongoing operational disruptions. The company swiftly responded by shutting down parts of its network and implementing temporary workarounds.</p> <p>While UNFI is working hard to resume services, the full impact on supply chains is still unfolding. No details have been released regarding the nature of the attack or whether a ransom was involved. The matter has been reported to law enforcement.</p> <p>As Whole Foods\u2019 primary supplier, UNFI\u2019s compromised systems could have ripple effects across the grocery sector. This incident highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, especially in food distribution, to cyber threats.</p> <p>This is part of a broader trend: recent cyberattacks have also affected U.K. retail giants and triggered warnings from Google about increased targeti",

I see the main benefits are that it can generate a recorded login, exploit a vulnerability, check for false positives, and do report summaries. The recorded login does not make too much sense to me because I struggle to see how it is any different other than not having to record your own login. Exploiting a vulnerability and verifying false positives are cool but I assume most people would need to double check those results anyways so while it does make things easier, I struggle to see where this makes a big difference. Really curious to see how people have been able to take full advantage of this feature! I am not trying to downplay AI or Portswigger, because I do think the exploit feature is really nice, I just want to know if it has made a difference in your testing significantly or if it is more like the equivalent of having Gram",
