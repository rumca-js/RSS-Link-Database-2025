I&#39;m now using my old M1 Mac Mini with a QNAP DAS attached for my four 20TB drives. Installing Plex was easy, and it runs beautifully on the M1. My next task was to install Docker \u2013 not only because of easier management, but also because of Gluetun. On Windows, I had my firewall set up as a leak protection: no VPN meant no internet access for Firefox, JDownloader, and qBittorrent.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve installed JDownloader (which I mainly use), qBittorrent, and Gluetun in Docker, with JDownloader and qBittorrent set as dependencies of Gluetun, which runs through ProtonVPN.</p> <p>It&#39;s my first time doing any &quot;server stuff,&quot; so I\u2019m pretty proud I got it ",

The Games which i play will remain in my SSD on my laptop, but im planning to offload the movies and some games i don&#39;t play onto the pendrives. Now i plan on keeping these drives plugged in 24/7, so my question is this bad for the pendrives?</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard that pendrives are a really bad form of storage, is this an old myth or have pendrives evolved into something better?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nihitplayz\"> /u/Nihitplayz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1l6zz4f/i_have_way_too_much_downloaded_stuff_so_i_need_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1l6zz4f/i_have_way_too",

HDR today is split between formats like HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision and HLG. Each having its own way of handling brightness, color and metadata. SDR, by comparison, follows one consistent open standard: Rec.709 and a standard gamma curve. It\u2019s predictable &amp; also reliable especially on 100% Rec.709 displays.</p> <p>Also many TVs advertise HDR support without the hardware to do it justice. I have a Sony X74K, which claims HDR10 support, but based on what I found through reviewers (via ChatGPT), it peaks around 470 nits instead of the minimum 1000. There\u2019s no official brightness spec from Sony. That\u2019s well below the level needed for really impactful HDR.</p> <p><em>(To be clear, HDR doesn\u2019t require 1000 nits but that\u2019s the common mastering target &amp; most HDR content is built around that or even higher (like 4000 or even 10,000 nits",

GenP uses the offical installer and applies patches the files, but this sounds like it can stop working at times? It does allow for updates via CC, so long as the new version is listed on the GenP website as patched.</p> <p>Is one method more reliable these days than the other? Are there significant benefits or risks for one over the other? Or, are they both much of a muchness and it comes down to personal preference whether you want to manage apps via CC or individually?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
