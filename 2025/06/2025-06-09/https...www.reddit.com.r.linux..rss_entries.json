I was creating/modifying some nano syntax files, and for the life of me I had no idea what the difference was between brown, ocher &amp; tawny - I was fed up of the change-save-loadexamplefile-nopeitsrubbish-repeat loop. With this, you set it up this syntax file (details in readme.md), then load the same file in nano again - and there you have all the colors to see how they look on your own system.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure someone has done this before, but it helped me better understand nano syntax files anyway - so I&#39;m happy with that.</p> <p>Gitea link above.
