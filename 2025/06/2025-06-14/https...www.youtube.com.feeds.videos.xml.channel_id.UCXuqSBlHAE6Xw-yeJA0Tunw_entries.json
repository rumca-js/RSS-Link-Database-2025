        "description": "Get your Killswitch for the Switch 2 at https://myhandsareverysmall.com\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is here!  And so is a new hole in my wallet. It boasts a stunning HDR screen, premium build, and significant performance leap with double the CPU cores, triple the RAM, and ten times the graphics - if you can believe Nvidia. While \"miracle ports\" shine and upgraded games look great, Joy-Cons still drift. The $80 game price and LCD screen are drawbacks, but the 120Hz refresh rate and potential for remote gaming are exciting. Should you buy one?\n\nHUGE thank you to both Good Vibes Gaming and Digital Foundry for allowing us to use some of their footage. Definitely check out both of them for some EXCELLENT deeper dives on Switch 2 performance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@GVG\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1615106-nintendo-switch-2-review-a-pc-gamer%E2%80%99s-perspective/\n\n\u25ba GET OUR MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON ",
