I know this GPU quite old, but it&#39;s not completely useless and it was lying around so I used it. The one thing I was missing was the motherboard, and I found a really cheap one online (CBR B450, but that probably won&#39;t tell you much &#39;cause it&#39;s a Chinese no name, but it was dirt cheap and that got me curious)</p> <p>So I installed EndeavorOS, installed proprietary Nvidia drivers and at first everything seemed to work fine, surprisingly fine tbh, Ghostrunner and Hi-fi Rush worked great. But then I decided to try something heavier, I installed Cyberpunk 2077 and Watch Dogs 2, and at first these two worked, I didn&#39;t expect them to work great, and they didn&#39;t, but they did work nonetheless. But when I tried to play those games for a bit longer, after some time my system just crashes, it happens sooner on X11 than on Wayland, but on X11 it ",

Whenever I try to play old school RuneScape on Linux my ping fluctuates + or - 30ms every second or so and is never stable. I am able to play on windows on the exact same hardware and it&#39;s rock solid. I have updated driver&#39;s and am fully up to date on everything. Any ideas as to what might be causing this as it is completely unplayable at the moment. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Emergency_Lime_2523\"> /u/Emergency_Lime_2523 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lbjt37/unstable_ping_in_runescape/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lbjt37/unstable_ping_in_runescape/\">[comments]</a></span>",

After all day trying to build from source, (because sudo apt install gamescope doesnt work (even through &quot;gamescope&quot; command returns something like try apt install gamescope)), i reinstalled whole mint, got flatpak steam version instead (coz it was supposed to work with flatpak version of gamescope).<br/> finally, the game launches, (with launch options: gamescope -h 1080 -H 1440 -S integer -- %command%) but the rendered resolution stays the same.

The things is, after I installed Fedora and the nvidia drivers, my external monitor wouldn&#39;t do 1080p 144Hz anymore and the fix was to move to 120Hz, not much of an issue. But from what I see, games that did not have a refresh rate settings or games that can&#39;t run via steam -windowed -noborder, would just get capped at 60Hz (I saw that by enabling vsync and getting only 60fps). What&#39;s even weirder is that if I change to 100Hz now the game stays at 100Hz when i enable vsync. How and why is this happening? Is there anything I could do? gamescope straight up crashes everytime, I reinstalled it, downgraded it, it won&#39;t run even with glxgears in terminal. I run only on my gpu, I have nvidia-drm smth set to 1 and I tried with the drivers both open and closed and that changes nothing. Also, my laptop",

I&#39;m going to be one of many who&#39;s gonna say that I&#39;m trying out jumping ship from Windows to Linux. I&#39;m not too green on Linux as I&#39;ve used it for work but I&#39;ve never really went using it as my gaming PC. I love what&#39;s been happening with the Steam Deck so decided to try it on my PC!</p> <p>I&#39;m running CachyOS as a distro and my hardware is a Ryzen 5800X with an RX6800. And I&#39;m just enjoying trying to see what works and what do",

See, proton tries to assign a gameID even when you&#39;re not running a Steam title and when it doesn&#39;t find one, it will assign a zero to it ( e.g. steam_app_0 ) , because of that, trying to change the icon will have an effect in every title that uses Proton ans isn&#39;t a official Steam game ( Like games from Epic Store or GOG ) , besides that they work just fine. With this out of the way i wanted to ask if someone knows how to change the appID or even how to make so that Proton doesn&#39;t try to assign it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ilovemygfb00bies\"> /u/Ilovemygfb00",

Hence, Terraria and tModLoader have to run at the same time. When I used to use Windows, when my friends got on to tModLoader, it would say they were playing tModLoader (when the commands launch), then Terraria (when the game launches), then tModLoader again. I assume Linux skips over saying tModLoader again, so my friend can&#39;t join.</p> <p>If anyone&#39;s experienced anything similar and fixed it, or has theories on how to fix it, please tell me.

There have been two reports on ProtonDB since then, and both of them report good results. When launching the game, the initial loading screen (a floating window) will appear. Then, after a much shorter time that usual, the window will disappear, and the game will crash. The game uses EasyAntiCheat, but I can more-or-less confirm that that is not the cause of the issue because Battlebit Remastered - which also uses EasyAntiCheat - still launches, however I am unable to test if online works due to that game being quite dead. Checking the Sea of Thieves launch logs, it contains the usual errors about a lack of NTLM and Kerberos support, and a a ulimit one (also quite common), but then the errors (from Wine) <code>7412.593:014c:0160:err:winediag:nodrv_CreateWindow Application tried to create a window, but no driver could be loaded. 7412.593:014c:0160:err:winediag:nodrv_C",
