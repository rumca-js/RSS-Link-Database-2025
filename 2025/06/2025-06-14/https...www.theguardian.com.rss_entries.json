Quite frankly, it would have been deeply and offensively off-brand for Xabi Alonso <em>not</em> to have joined in. Darting around in the roasting heat, physically moving players into his desired positions, pinging pinpoint passes in his classic Predator boots: it was Alonso in his purest essence, and as the new Real Madrid coach oversaw his first sessions at Valdebebas this week it was hard not to feel that on some level nature was healing.</p><p>As a player Alonso was a difference-maker, a details man, a midfielder who adored the ball and tried to leave nothing to chance.

It\u2019s liquid electricity and one of my favourite earthly flavours. It could make a great stock, or a delicious martini, perhaps even a marinade for ceviche, but here it\u2019s thrown in at the end to refresh a dish of gently cooked tomatoes, beans and dill.
