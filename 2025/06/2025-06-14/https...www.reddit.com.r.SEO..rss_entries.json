Before setting up Shopify, my custom domain was pointed to my Etsy store. After switching to Shopify, I submitted my sitemap.xml to Google Search Console to kick off indexing.</p> <p>A few days later, I checked back and saw an error saying the sitemap couldn\u2019t be indexed because of a redirect. I assumed that was because the domain had previously redirected to Etsy. So I waited a few more days, re-submitted the sitemap, and checked again\u2014same issue. The status said validation started on June 8, and the last update was June 9, but there\u2019s been no progress since.</p> <p>To troubleshoot, I opened my sitemap.xml and added the individual collection pages from it directly into Google Search Console (rather than relying solely on the main sitemap). After doing this, Google showed that it found multiple pages in those collections. I thought that meant it was finally working.</p",

I am new in SEO sales, but I am stating out and it seems the sales was easy. Was I just lucky or is there a lot of work in this business? Or does this mean SEO agencies are not working hard enough to call and prospect for new clients, especially cold calling.
