I see it mentioned often, but I\u2019m not sure if it would actually add anything to my current setup.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I do:</p> <ul> <li>I use NFS shares from my NAS across all my desktops and laptops</li> <li>Syncthing handles file syncing between devices</li> <li>On my GrapheneOS Android phone, I use open-source file manager apps with SMB and Syncthing</li> </ul> <p>So my question is, does Nextcloud actually offer anything I\u2019m missing? Or is it just a more centralized way to do what I\u2019m already doing with NFS, Syncthing, and file managers?</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate any insight from people who have experience with both.

Down the road the goal would be to be able to take in data from an REST API&#39;s with low code to cover up most missing widget types or the lack of them. Ideally these would be fairly easy to make with .NET</p> <p>What I&#39;m trying to make is a Dashboard tool that covers self-hosters needs for both cloud deployments, on-premises/small home infrastructure in one package while keeping it easy to maintain and ofc free &amp; open source.</p> <p>As so I want to ask <a href=\"/r/selfhosted\">r/selfhosted</a> do you feel like you are missing in your day to day dashboard or a feature you&#39;d like to see</p> <p>Please ask any questions, in the end this is project both for fun and hopefully to mak",
