For years, Nintendo has been known for <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-shows-that-without-change-accessibility-in-nintendo-games-will-remain-accidental\">accidentally stumbling on accessibility solutions</a> while stubbornly refusing to engage with the broader subject. Yet, in the Switch 2, there appeared a more holistic approach to accessibility for which disabled players have been crying out.

Instead of releasing a successor that feels like a generational leap or a pivot in a new direction, it's following up the hugely successful original with the Switch 2 - a welcome upgrade that largely sticks to the formula. It looks about the same, works about the same, and plays most of the same games. It's the Switch, just better.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nintendo's bet is that it doesn't have to wow people all over again, and so it made a sequel that's only as good as it needs to be.
