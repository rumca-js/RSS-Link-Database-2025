For a while even ran my own blog with tons of step by step articles on how to do everything from setup servers to connecting to services. In all this time the most exclusive indexer I&#39;ve managed to get into was poo flinging monkey, and drunken slug. These days all I use is drunken slug, and I really miss PFM, at one point I had about 10 indexers, just common ones that are in the list here. So I guess I&#39;m curious is, is how did everyone that got into these exclusive indexers find them? Was it just ",

Currently I am failing to get search results for something and I am wondering if I need a new provider or indexer. My provider has a large retention. Besides retention does the provider make a difference or is it all up to whatever indexer I\u2019m using? Thanks for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Korte2020\"> /u/Korte2020 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1lbcb22/providers_vs_indexers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1lbcb22/providers_vs_indexers/\">[comments]</a></span>",
