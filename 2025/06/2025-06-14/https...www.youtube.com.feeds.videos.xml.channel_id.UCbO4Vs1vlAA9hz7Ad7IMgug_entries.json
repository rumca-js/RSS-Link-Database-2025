        "description": "We're trying out something new with a LIVE GMG REVIEW! \n\nHArdware is the upcoming new Quick to Play combined-arms game from Modiphius with its own set of 10mm miniatures in plastic-resin. Come hang out while I review the preview rules and the new models before the official launch of their campaign. \n\nModiphius are the publishers for the prestige editions of such favourites as Rangers of Shadow Deep, Five Leagues and Parsecs and a pile of great RPGs. They also handle all the Bethesda licensed titles such as Fallout and Elder Scrolls. This is their first foray into a new scale!\n\nThanks to Chris as the folks at Modiphius for the advance copies to review. \n\n\nGO check out all the new channels!\n\nGMG Inside Tabletop\nyoutube.com/@GMGInsideTabletop\n\nGMG Throwback Thursdays\nyoutube.com/@GMGThrowbackThursdays\n\nGMG Games Workshop Games\nyoutube.com/@GMGGamesWorkshopGames\n\nGMG Infinity x TacAware\nyoutube.com/@GMGInfinityxTacticalAwareness\n\nIntro music 'Retrofuture Nasty' by Kevin McLeod",
