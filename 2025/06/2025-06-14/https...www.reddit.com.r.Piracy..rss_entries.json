We have been talking about playing Warhammer fantasy many times before, but the barrier to entry in both money and learning is very high.</p> <p>So my plan is to 3D print a starter army for each of the races with the basic rules so we can dip our toes without breaking the bank.</p> <p>But how to get started? There are so many versions, even when just looking at the fantasy version. For the files I have found, they use different names to avoid getting taken down by Games Workshop, but that only makes it harder for a new player.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, I hope someone can point me in the right direction.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Edward-Paper-Hands\"> /u/Edward-Paper-Hands </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
