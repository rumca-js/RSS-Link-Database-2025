Basically, whenever a user does any CRUD ops on products, catalogs, etc, I want to create an activity object with all the relevant details. The idea is to just hit a REST API on the frontend and get a nice activity feed. (working with DRF) I\u2019ve looked around and a lot of people (and AI) suggest using signals for this, but honestly, signals feel like a debugging nightmare (even the official docs kinda warn you). I\u2019ve got like 8-10 different components I want to track in the activities table, so it\u2019s not just a couple of models. Is there a better way/library for this kind of thing?
