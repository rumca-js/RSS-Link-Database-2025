WordPress Sites (1.5 million files) on one Debian 11.2 vps running, the majority of course crypto etc from very dubious tld (sigh). </p> <p>Is, of course, flagged by virustotal for being malicious (surprise, surprise).</p> <p>Now I wanted to scan it in the first step via clamav which does not seem to be able to finish even after 11 hours running on 3 cores. Then I tried wordfence-cli which terminated as well after almost a day running. Already audited via Lynis and rkhunter, strangely I don&#39;t find any open-casp pkg for Debian 11. </p> <p>Anyone any idea what else could be done (apart from the obvious, running the scan in batches) ?!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CmdWaterford\"> /u/CmdWaterford </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1lb627f/huge_amount_of_wordpress_sites_on_one_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",
