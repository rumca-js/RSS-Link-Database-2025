Maybe I&#39;m dumb and/or blind, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I&#39;ve built a few apps that I want to run in Docker, and given that they are completely for personal use, I&#39;d rather not have to go through something like DockerHub. I am using Visual Studio if that makes any difference.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iconoclast_XVII\"> /u/Iconoclast_XVII </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1laxie4/builddeploy_docker_image_through_file_system/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1laxie4/builddeploy_docker_image_through_file_system/\">[comments]</a></span>",
