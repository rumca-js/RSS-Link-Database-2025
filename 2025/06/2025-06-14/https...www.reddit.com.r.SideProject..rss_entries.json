I would love some feedback on it, and what you think of the idea in general. It&#39;s a micro-journaling app, that builds on the concept of bullet journaling and aims to expand on it by integrating other media content. If you&#39;re interested: <a href=\"https://micronote.pages.dev\">here&#39;s the link</a>.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this app is very early-stage, and there&#39;s a lot still to be done. In the demo app the only things that work are the text input and the copy and delete features. When you head to the link, it starts on the landing page with a little info on the app. You can then click any available &quot;Try the demo&quot; link to open the demo. <strong>The waitlist form doesn&#39;t work, and is just there as a placeholder</strong>.</p> <p>Please tell me what you think, any and all feedback is welcome, whether a nitpick or a detailed opinion.</p> ",

I sent a buyer a digital unlock code for my software by email several times (which never bounced) because they kept claiming they never received it. My site&#39;s &quot;Contact&quot; page even links to my company&#39;s subreddit so the buyer can discuss the issue there if email isn&#39;t working for them, but PayPal decided this wasn&#39;t enough proof and refunded the buyer anyway.</p> <p>I looked at PayPal&#39;s Resolution Center for an &quot;Appeal&quot; link but there isn&#39;t any. At the end of the day I guess I don&#39;t need such a liar as a customer anyway, so I let it go. I only lost $40 so such is life. But still, this bugs me that PayPal doesn&#39;t care what proof the seller provides and automatically sides with the buyer. :(</p> <p>Any ideas or tips on how I can avoid such claims of non-receipt in future? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IndieDeveloperDude\"> /u/In",
