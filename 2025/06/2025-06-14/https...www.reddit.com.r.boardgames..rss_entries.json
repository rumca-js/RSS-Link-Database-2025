I really liked the concept of solving mysteries in the past, trying multiple times to gather more information, etc. But the asylum theme, horror and gore were too much for me. I knew this would potentially be the case but was sad because I like the rest of it a lot. Are the other scenarios as dark, gory, horror? </p> <p>Also: we got absolutely stuck on the last puzzle before the last fight, that one was really disappointing. It stopped being fun and even after we learned the solution feel it was badly designed. Will this issue come up in other scenarios too or is it just that one puzzle that&#39;s so hard to do even if you have all the necessary pieces?</p> <p>If the answers are: yes all scenarios are horror and yes, there are many puzzles that are as hard (bad) as this one, do you have recommendations for me/us of games with a lighter theme and better puzzles?</p> </div><!--",

My question is, what do fellow trick taking lovers think is missing from the genre? What would you like to see, either mechanics-wise or theme-wise? I&#39;d like to see some more map based trick-takers like Brian Boru, and Joraku. Also, maybe trick takers that use dice in clever ways.

One of the questions we have is that the rules say to have a science/progress victory you have to obtain six progress tokens so our question is - does that mean you backfill progress tokens on the board once somebody has received one for matching the science cards? </p> <p>Or do you leave that token space empty and to win a science Victory it means you would have to get all of those tokens plus you would need to get that Wonder card that allows you to pick from three that have not been in play since the beginning of the game? Does this make sense? </p> <p>Because if you backfill tokens once played and then someone builds that particular wonder where you get to pick one from 3 that have not been in play, there may only be two left or something like that?</p> <p>Lil help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AKFree20",
