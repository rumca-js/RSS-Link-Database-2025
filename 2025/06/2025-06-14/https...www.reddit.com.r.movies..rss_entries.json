So now I go with him and buy a whole bunch. Like recently at a library sale I bought like 80 movies for just a few dollars. Same with a donation shop I went to. I also do this for film preservation. It\u2019s great to own all these movies. I\u2019m proud to say I have over 1000 movies on DVD, Blu ray and 4K total. I was wondering if anyone else gets DVDs still besides my dad and I lol.

For context it can only be 3 movies so anything that has a fourth movie or more or a part two to the 3rd movie doesn\u2019t count. He says that Venom is the worst and my submission is XXX. Curious if there\u2019s any that we might be over looking. Honorable mention is Hangover, however the first one is so good I couldn\u2019t include it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rickblaster\"> /u/rickblaster </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lawp7d/worst_trilogy_of_all_time/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lawp7d/worst_trilogy_of_all_time/\">[comments]</a></span>",
