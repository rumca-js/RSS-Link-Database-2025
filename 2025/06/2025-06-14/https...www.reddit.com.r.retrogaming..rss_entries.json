But I have to say, PC gaming has its own mascots too. And if you grew up on PC gaming, you know exactly who I\u2019m talking about. To me, these are the most obvious PC gaming mascots:</p> <p><strong>Sir Graham</strong></p> <p>Sierra\u2019s signature character. He\u2019s the protagonist of King&#39;s Quest, the game that pretty much &quot;made&quot; PC gaming. If you\u2019ve ever typed &quot;look at tree&quot; only to die instantly, you know this guy.</p> <p><strong>Guybrush Threepwood</strong></p> <p>For a good long time, the Monkey Island series was the jewel of PC adventure games, and Guybrush was the poster child. For an entire generation of smart-alecks, Guybrush was what made pointing and clicking actually cool.</p> <p><strong>Commander Keen</strong></p> <p>PC\u2019s answer ",

The original PS1 controller didn\u2019t even have analog sticks, so most games with 3D graphics still controlled like 2D games (think of Final Fantasy VII, with 3D characters on 2D backgrounds). Even &quot;true&quot; 3D games often used awkward tank controls or digital inputs.</p> <p>Yes, there were exceptions like Metal Gear Solid or Resident Evil, but even many of those games haven\u2019t aged especially well. The majority of PS1 3D games feel clunky today.</p> <p>I just wish that generation had been more about perfecting 2D at 32 bits. A fully 2D-focused PS1 era could\u2019ve given us more games on the level of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\u2014arcade-quality 2D games that still hold up beautifully today.</p> <p>I",
