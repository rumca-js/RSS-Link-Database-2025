The dataset is a collection dialogues between people and LLMs where, one way or another, the conversations go off the rails... Embezzlement advice, leech therapy, and hot tempers over the Vikings chances of winning the Superbowl after not making it to the playoffs. Some are hilarious, to me at least.</p> <p>I think the dataset is used to try train LLMs to avoid this wacky stuff and to make the future LLMs better aligned to humanity.

Recently, I whitelabelled a Voice AI SaaS to package it with my current solutions and honestly its been going great and its pretty damn comprehensive.</p> <p>But I have question for other whitelabellers: How do you handle client requests for niche features that aren\u2019t part of the core software? I mean a lot of integrations with other features can be done through zapier, make, API or webhooks but do yall do anything else? Do you just say no, try to build workarounds, or somehow manage their expectations?
