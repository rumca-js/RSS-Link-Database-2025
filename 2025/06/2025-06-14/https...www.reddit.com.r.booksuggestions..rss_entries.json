New books and old ones each have their own unique scent, and I don\u2019t know why, but I really enjoy that.</p> <p>With physical books, I also like to highlight words or phrases that interest me using a pencil. It just feels so much more intuitive.</p> <p>However, due to constantly relocating and moving around, sometimes to the point of scratching my nails across my palm out of frustration, I\u2019ve had to adapt. So, while it\u2019s not my initial preference, I sometimes have to rely on digital formats.</p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s my take. What about you?

So I&#39;m desperately trying to find more books that have the same vibe as last night at the telegraph club, music from another world and stone butch blues. It doesn&#39;t need to be sapphic, but I want a story that&#39;s set around 1920s-1980s, preferably during a relevant time in queer history like stonewall or something like that. bonus point if it&#39;s about a transmasc character. Any recs set during that time frame, regardless of theme would be appreciated, to be honest </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Upper-Photograph-105\"> /u/Upper-Photograph-105 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lava9x/lgbt_fiction_set_during_the_50s_60s_or_70s/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lava9x/lgbt_fiction_set_during_the_50s_60s_or_70s/\">[comments]</a></span>",
