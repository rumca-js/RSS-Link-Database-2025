Would still like to have wifi thermostat scheduling.</p> <p>How would you do it?</p> <p>What I tried that didn&#39;t work: I currently have a prioritizing demand controler, but it just causes both A/Cs to constantly fight causing load shedding when my solar can&#39;t keep up. This causes the A/Cs to short cycle and when the load shedding is removed both A/Cs come online to only be shut off 5 minutes later because both were running.</p> <p>My proposal: (raspberry pi stuff is coming soon) Qty: 2 dumbish Arduino thermostats (Arduino, relay shield, 1602 display and bittons via LCD keypad shield, and tmo36); that are I2C slaves for sending requests to(temp settings/modes etc..), and feeding info to",
