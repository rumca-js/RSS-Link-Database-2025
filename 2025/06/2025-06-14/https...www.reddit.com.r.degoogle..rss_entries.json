I currently have a POCO X6 Pro, in terms of hardware, it&#39;s great, I have no criticisms, but HyperOS (the OS on this phone) is a piece of crap, and I find the idea of \u200b\u200bhaving a phone without any Google services interesting, but how do I do that? I know that there are community Android OSs that solve this, but I don&#39;t know if I could install them on my phone. And I&#39;ve also seen some phones in Europe that sell their own OSs with the same idea, but I don&#39;t live in Europe, much less have the conditions to export one of those to where I live.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chester_Linux\"> /u/Chester_Linux </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1lblcdi/so_how_do_i_make_my_phone_no_longer_have_any/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comme",

One of my most used apps is a bird watching app, which has all my information on every bird I&#39;ve spotted on it, and it won&#39;t run without google play. I know bird watching isn&#39;t exactly a popular pastime, but I do miss it and nothing else has come close to it for functionality. </p> <p>My question is - since I have root access, what happens if I get google play? Can I deny them permissions they don&#39;t need? </p> <p>My other one is YouTube music. I pay for premium (still!).
