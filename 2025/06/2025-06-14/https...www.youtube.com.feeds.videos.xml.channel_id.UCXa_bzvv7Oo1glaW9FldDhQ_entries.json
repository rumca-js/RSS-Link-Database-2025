        "description": "It\u2019s not unusual for video game developers to conjure unconventional ways to indicate a character\u2019s health to players, with this video highlighting fifteen such titles that forgo traditional health bars to portray that most vital of statistics via other means. \n\nThe examples on this rundown all indicate health via imaginative means beyond a traditional health bar, such as diegetic designs, and auditory or visual feedback. Sometimes, mechanics-driven adjustments are embedded into gameplay either via combat skill, crafting, or simply taking the time to rest. \n\nSome of the games in this feature do harbor a health gauge that\u2019s traditional in appearance but functions via an alternative method. Some of the most immersive systems, as it happens, are when health gauges are foregone completely in favour of systems which rely on player intuition.",

        "description": "We've seen competitive multiplayer shooters in the mecha space before (RIP Gundam Evolution), but nothing quite like Mecha BREAK. Developed by Amazing Seasun Games and launching on July 2nd for Xbox Series X/S and PC, it's fast-paced, frantic, and exceedingly good-looking.\n\nWith mechs (known as Strikers) immediately available, no grinding required, there's some great variety to the playstyles. Whether you're a Macross fan that favors vehicle transformations or a Gundam lover who wants the beam rifles, shields, and melee weapons, there's a Striker for every kind of mecha enthusiast. Alongside 6v6 objective-based maps and 3v3 competitive matches, it includes an extraction shooter mode where players can battle against AI and each other.\n\nAmazing Seasun Games is also planning some new maps and Strikers for launch, which are already looking sharp. Check out everything you should know about Mecha BREAK and whether it may be worth playing.",

        "description": "Death Stranding has been criticized for a number of things, but lack of innovation and open-world design aren\u2019t among them. Whether you think Kojima is a mastermind or otherwise, Death Stranding is sure to bring something truly unique to players. \n\nOne of the main things I appreciate about the game is its focus on engaging traversal. You don\u2019t just use the open-world to get from one point to another, you actively fight the terrain and interact with it through gameplay mechanics. Yeah, balancing and organizing cargo doesn\u2019t seem very \u2018fun\u2019 or exciting, but it sure does feel good with the adaptive trigger support and excellent controls. \n\nThe game also has that typical Kojima acting talent that has characterized his work since Metal Gear Solid. But Norman Reedus and Mads Mickelson don\u2019t just phone it in, but rather add a dimension of authenticity and immersion to the world that make it seem all that much more real. With Death Stranding as fascinating and engaging as it is, we can\u2019t wait",
