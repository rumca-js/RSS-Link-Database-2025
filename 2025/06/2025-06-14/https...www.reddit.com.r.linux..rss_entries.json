I&#39;m brand new to linux I&#39;ve been running it for maybe a month or two, and am really enjoying linux mint and learning the ins and outs of terminal. I&#39;ve been sick of Windows for a while and it feels like the old days of computers again!</p> <p>Well anyway, I found this old Packard Bell in the basement and the gf says she might have some old files on it so I figured I would try to hook it up. </p> <p>I found the old matching Packard monitor and a newer ps/2 keyboard and tried getting this thing to run. No luck, I figured it would be a miracle if it did run. Nothing more than green lights on each. Hooked up the ?tower? to my newer monitors VGA connection, no dice. </p> <p>Well I decided to check out the harddrive since I heard it was spinning. Ive forgotten this thing takes ide cables, then remembered I had an &quot;StarTech.com&quot; USB device thing I don&#39;t even remember the name of that connects USB to ide, sata, etc. </p> <p>",

But the truth is 1. Most newbie don&#39;t even know about the evil maid attack. (Physical access to disk + Boot tamper) 2. Even if you encrypt the /boot with luks2 encryption. We won&#39;t be able to boot it up as Grub doesn&#39;t support Argon2id as of now which comes by default with luks2 which is a successor of PBKDF2. Argon2id does prevent us from GPU attacks from cracking disk passphrase and luks2 + PBKDF2 is currently supported but it&#39;s still a weak mechanism. 3. The only viable solution is to keep /boot partition on the external drive and only plug in when booting a d have luks2 argon2id for root partition. 4.
