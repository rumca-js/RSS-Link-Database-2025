        "description": "<p>Today, we're going back to the roots of Tale of Painters with one of our popular painting guides. Step by step, I\u2019ll show you how to paint the Glade Guard of the Wood Elves. We\u2019ll use a combination of Contrast, Slapchop, and additional highlights to get units on the table quickly, but still to a high standard. The techniques demonstrated can easily be adapted for a wide range of organic and green-toned models \u2013 and it\u2019s also the first time I\u2019ll be trying out the new Quick Gen paints from AK.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/06/tutorial-how-to-paint-wood-elves-glade-guard/\">Tutorial: How to paint Wood Elves Glade Guard</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
