Technically Pevara appears earlier but she becomes a fully-fleshed character only in A Memory of Light. Her relation with Androl gives a fresh and much needed perspective on the Red Ajah which was quite demonised up to that point.</p> <p>Speaking about duos, perhaps a less extreme example as they appear half-way through, but Tehol Beddict and Bugg from the Malazan series have so many memorable moments it&#39;s hard to believe there were four books without them. Same can be said about Hellian, probably one of the funniest characters in Malazan (and one of my favourite) whose first appearance is as late as the sixth volume.</p> <p>There are probably so many others who don&#39;t come up at the top of my head, but I&#39;ll be glad to see your examples!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",

Like Jim Butcher does to Harry Dresden. Or Pierce Brown with Darrow. My personal favorite author when it comes to this is Brent Weeks. Because he&#39;s done it in both of his major series. Especially if you read the new night angel, the things he puts Kylar through...jeez. And I won&#39;t spoil anything, but Mr. Prism Guile when the series begins goes through some incredible sh*t. Does anyone else appreciate when authors abuse their own characters?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unfair_Weakness_1999\"> /u/Unfair_Weakness_1999 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l596b1/authors_who_",

I\u2019ve devoured the first three books and one of the things that keeps me hooked is how distinct the magic system and caste dynamics feel compared to other fantasy series. The representation of Indian and Eastern cultures is refreshing and gives the world a unique flavor that isn\u2019t often explored in mainstream fantasy.</p> <p>Unlike the usual medieval European settings in fantasy, this series takes a completely different approach, drawing from Indian mythology and history. Instead of knights and castles, you get a world shaped by ancient power structures, rigid caste divisions, and a magic system that feels deeply rooted in myth and divine influence. The way magic works with ties to oaths, gods, and fate makes it feel less like a set of spells and more like a force that shapes every aspect of the world and characters.
