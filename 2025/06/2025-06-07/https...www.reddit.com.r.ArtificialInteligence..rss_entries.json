These robots, specifically the Figure 02 model from California-based Figure AI, are not just a technological marvel. They are a potential economic disruptor. The robots can perform complex tasks, such as inserting sheet metal parts with millimeter precision. The estimated price is $30,000 per unit. Amortization costs are around $300 per month, or roughly 40 cents per hour. This is based on 24/7 operation over five years. These robots can theoretically perform any task a human can. This development raises profound questions about the future of work across multiple industries. These industries include fast food, car repair, warehousing, and even white-collar jobs. Let\u2019s explore what this could mean. We will consider a relatable exam",

I wanted to write this quick post to get some advice on what to do with my life. </p> <p>I was planning to start college this year and major in either Engineering or Mathematics however, after seeing AI 2027 and just how much AI has progressed in the last few years, I\u2019m now wondering if college is even worth it anymore especially in four years once I graduate. Is Engineering or Mathematics safe for the future of AI or will these get taken over as well? </p> <p>I\u2019ve got some really great scholarships so my entire cost for university will be only around 15k total but I\u2019m still wondering if it\u2019s worth it. Or should I just continue to pursue creative works such as music while getting a labor job or something. </p> <p>Im just so lost on what to do, I wish I wasn\u2019t born in this time period lol</p> <p>Any advice is greatly appreciated.

We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent\u2019s policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AngleAccomplished865\"> /u/AngleAccomplished865 </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

Headquartered in London and backed by major investors including Microsoft, the Qatar Investment Authority, SoftBank\u2019s DeepCore, and IFC, the startup promised to make software creation &quot;as easy as ordering pizza&quot;. Its much-touted AI assistant, Natasha, was marketed as a breakthrough that could build software with minimal human input. At its peak, Builder.ai raised over $450 million and achieved a valuation of $1.5 billion. But the company\u2019s glittering image masked a starkly different reality. </p> <p>Contrary to its claims, Builder.ai\u2019s development process relied on around 700 human engineers in India. These engineers manually wrote code for client projects while the company portrayed the work as AI-generated. The fa\u00e7ade began to crack after ind",

The narrative uncovers the self-reinforcing dynamics at the heart of AI&#39;s proliferation, suggesting that the technology is creating an environment optimized for its own growth. The episode breaks down the five key feedback loops propelling this evolution. It begins with AI&#39;s insatiable appetite for data, demonstrating how it actively refines and expands the very information it needs to learn. This leads into the economic imperatives driving the system, where AI&#39;s increasing utility compels massive investments in the infrastructure it requires to become more powerful. The story then takes a fascinating turn, investigating how AI is now influencing and learning from content generated by other AIs, creating a new, synthetic layer of information that ",
