We were born 11 days apart and were both one when our families moved on to the same street in Geelong, a port city an hour south-west of Melbourne. We had a very Australian childhood; summers spent in our bathers, running through sprinklers; swimming in back yard pools; eating sausages in bread on New Year\u2019s Eve, when we were allowed to stay up late while our parents drank cask riesling with the neighbours, and we\u2019d lie on the cool evening grass listening to crickets.</p><p>During those blisteringly hot summer days of our childhood, we lived at the beach, where shark alarms were constant and the waves dangerous. Occasionally, Chrissy would paddle out on her inflatable red and blue raft to the big waves out the back where the serious surfers were.",

The Masters champion shot a dismal second-round 78 on Friday, carding a quadruple bogey, a double and four other bogeys in an eight-over-par round that left him languishing 21 shots behind the halfway leader, Cameron Champ, who finished on 12 under.</p><p>It is the first time the world No 2 has missed the cut since the Open at Royal Troon last July. McIlroy\u2019s round continued his troubled buildup to Oakmont having been forced to switch to a different driver after his previous model was deemed non-conforming in a random test on the eve of last month\u2019s US PGA Championship, in which he finished joint-47th.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/07/rory-mcilroy-worried-about-us-open-bid-after-missing-cut-wi",
