How lovely that The Golden Spurtle \u2013 Constantine Costi\u2019s charming documentary about the world\u2019s annual porridge-making championship in the Scottish village of Carrbridge \u2013 has assumed some of the qualities of the dish. It isn\u2019t flashy (and certainly doesn\u2019t scream \u201cmust-watch\u201d) but, like a good ol\u2019 fashioned bowl of well-cooked oats, it\u2019s got it where it counts.</p><p>This film is a pleasure to watch \u2013 with endearing salt-of-the-earth subjects, a lovely ebb and flow, and a tone that feels just right: neither overly serious nor tongue in cheek.
