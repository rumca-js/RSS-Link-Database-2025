And I am never going back lol.</p> <p>But my needs have changed after 10 years: I am no longer a hardcore gamer but I still do play casually, mostly single player titles like CP2077 or similar. But one thing I really want now is <strong>some form</strong> of mobility, which when I built my desktop was not an issue at all. I am talking &quot;some&quot; because most of the time it&#39;ll remain seated on my desktop BUT I might take it with me when I stay over at my girlfriend for example.</p> <p>So this has thrown me in the search of a gaming laptop that I will put Arch on.

Tried downloading freetube to take my mind off that too, so I got the portable zip and extracted it using peazip, but when I launched it was pixelated even worse than steam.
