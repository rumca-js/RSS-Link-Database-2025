I have made 300 friends, who regularly visit my website atleast once a month, and they really like the content. Before few years when this AI was not a thing like as its today, I used to get \u20b9102 (approx. 1USD cpc)... I was earning small but it was good to see the progress.... but since few months, the cpc is \u20b910 (0.1USD). I am thinking to target some high cpc content, as a side posting strategy... I have been a regular writer since 5 years now, framing my ideas into the words are very easy for me now (as I see English only in Books, Internet, and Keyboards). Ok, now the question. I focus on science or STEM feilds, and I will be a regular writer for that, now the main thing is that, can you help me to",
