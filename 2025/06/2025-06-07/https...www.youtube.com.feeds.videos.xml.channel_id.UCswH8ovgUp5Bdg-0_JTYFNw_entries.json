        "description": "Church attendance is rising, people are turning to Jesus\u2014and even Bill Maher is questioning atheism. Russell explores a surprising conversation between Maher and Charlie Kirk on faith, the resurrection, and the Shroud of Turin. Is a spiritual revival underway as globalism fades?
