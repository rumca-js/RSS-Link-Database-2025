Of course, like many, I saw them back in high school\u2014but watching them now, with fresh eyes and a bit more life behind me, left me in absolute awe.</p> <p>Quentin Tarantino truly crafted something unreal with these films. The stylistic range, the pacing, the character arcs, the music, the cinematography\u2026 it\u2019s all so intentional, so bold, and so damn cool. It reminded me of just how thrilling movies can be when every frame feels like it was made with love and madness.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been craving that \u201choly sh*t, THIS is cinema\u201d feeling for a while now, and Kill Bill delivered it in spades. It\u2019s a reminder of why we fall in love with film in the first place.</p> <p>So if it\u2019s been a few years\u2014or you\u2019ve only ever seen it once\u2014this is your sign to queue it up.

Couldn&#39;t remember why though. I just gave it a quick search and saw that it was George Clooney, Harvey Kitel, Selma Hyek and that Tarantino had something to do with it.

There\u2019s no big championship scene, no locker room speech, no slow-mo victory montage. Instead, it\u2019s about spreadsheets, stats, undervalued players and background story of how much pressure they go through.</p> <p>Brad pitt was just excellent and he should have won oscar for this one rather than OUATIH.
