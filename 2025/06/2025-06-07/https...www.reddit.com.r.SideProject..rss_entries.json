Some LLMs adjust to the prompt like &quot;dont include any words, always return a JSON&quot;, but need additionally parsing to strip out characters, but some LLMs dont respect the prompt at all which is frustrating when the app is in production and you need to switch to a different LLM temporarily.</p> <p>So my question is </p> <ol> <li>How do you switch between these LLMs without maintaining 5 different API keys?

So I decided to build something myself.</p> <p>Meet &quot;Turron&quot; \u2014 a system designed to locate the original video using just a small snippets. Inspired by Shazam, it works by extracting keyframes from the snippet, generating perceptual hashes (using the pHash algorithm), and comparing them against hashes from a known video database using Hamming distance.</p> <p>Yesterday I released v1.0. Right now it works locally with Postgres as the storage backend.

In this quiz, one participant thinks of a famous personality and the others (in TV show, the host) try to guess who it is by asking yes/no questions.</p> <p>I developed a telegram bot which brings the excitement to Telegram using an AI (a small Qwen model running locally using ollama) which picks a secret person from a given list of popular names and answers the user questions. I have also added an interesting feature &quot;/summary&quot;, where one can view the A.I thinking process while answering user questions.</p> <p>You can try this in your telegram groups or directly with the bot in private chat itself. Please let me know your feedback. Also please let me know if anyone interested in collaborating for deploying this at scale.</p> <p>Here is the GitHub link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/sneerajmoh",

It includes:</p> <p>- GUI interface with tabs for Sender, Receiver, and File Browser</p> <p>- Auto host discovery or manual IP entry</p> <p>- Transfer status + file integrity check (hash validation)</p> <p>- Drag &amp; Drop and multi-file transfer</p> <p>- Receiver-side: listening port + save path selection</p> <p>It uses `socket`, `tkinter`, and standard Python libraries. I also handled some fun edge cases like broadcasting across VMs, and it works reliably across local networks.</p> <p>Built this mostly using GitHub Copilot + debugging manually. Had a lot of fun in doing so.</p> <p>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/asim-builds/File-Share.git\">https://github.com/asim-builds/File-Share.git</a></p> <p>Happy to hear any feedback or suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
