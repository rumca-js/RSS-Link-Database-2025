It's the 1980s and no-one suspects that you, a famous fashion photography, also happens to be an infamous master thief - using your cover, as well as your camera, to identify high value items and anything that might help or hindering your plans when night falls and your crime spree begins. You'll gather intel, use your photos to assemble a step-by-step plan, and even try and shake-off the detective on your tail. Snap and Grab, which is being published by <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive\">Annapurna Interactive</a>, comes to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S \"early next year\".\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/day-of-the-devs-2025-everything-announced-in-the-big-indie-showcase\">Read more</a></p>",
