You can view the specs here <a href=\"https://comptechdirect.com/products/hp-15-bs134wm-15-6-hd-notebook-intel-pentium-gold-4417u-2-30ghz-4gb-ram-500gb-hdd-win10h-6bs61ua-aba-certified-refurbished\">Here*</a>, but I will also list them. The device was released in 2018 I believe and the hardware installed is</p> <p>Processor: Intel Pentium 4417U 2.30 GHz</p> <p>Ram: 4GB DDR4</p> <p>Disk: 500GB Seagate SATA drive</p> <p>At some point I may upgrade the RAM and Storage, but not sure. </p> <p>This device will mainly be used for web-browsing and watching netflix, youtube ect. I&#39;d like an OS that is relatively easy and simple to use/maintain since my non-tech savvy wife will be the main user.</p> <p>I am planning on using Brave browser as that is what I use on my desktops, but also open to other browser suggestions. </p>",
