So I decided to build something myself.</p> <p>Meet &quot;Turron&quot; \u2014 a system designed to locate the original video using just a small snippets. Inspired by Shazam, it works by extracting keyframes from the snippet, generating perceptual hashes (using the pHash algorithm), and comparing them against hashes from a known video database using Hamming distance.</p> <p>Yesterday I released v1.0. Right now it works locally with Postgres as the storage backend.
