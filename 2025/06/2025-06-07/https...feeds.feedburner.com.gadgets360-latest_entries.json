These events, brighter and longer-lasting than supernovae, were observed using data from Gaia and ZTF. As the most energetic cosmic outbursts since the Big Bang, they offer valuable insights into black hole growth and galactic activity in the early universe.",

New research now confirms it was caused by two mega-tsunamis triggered by landslides in East Greenland. The waves became trapped in a fjord, forming seiches that shook the Earth. Using cutting-edge data from NASA\u2019s SWOT satellite, scientists detected these hidden waves for the first time, solving the mystery and highlighting climate-driven extremes. The study also showcases how advanced satellite technology can uncover remote phenomena invisible to traditional methods, reshaping our ability to monitor Earth\u2019s changing climate and seismic activity.",
