Can you say whether this algorithm can work in real life:</p> <p>1) Connecting to the same LAN as a target IP camera 2) Port scanning the whole network with nmap to identify the camera&#39;s private IP and its open ports (http 80 or rtsp 554). 3) Trying to connect to it via browser while staying in the same LAN. If the camera is accessible, proceed to the next step. 4) If router&#39;s admin panel uses default login credentials (e.g. admin, 1234), you can easily log in and forward camera&#39;s ports and assign your camera a DDNS name to have permanent access to the camera after disconnecting from the LAN. In most cases, target&#39;s public IP address is dynamic and changes over time, so DDNS will be needed to ensure permanent access. 5) if router&#39;s admin panel&#39;s credentials were change",
