We are getting lapped to an\nunfathomable degree because of how productive they are with\nKotlin, Compose, and Cursor. They are able to support all the way\nback to Android 10 (2019) with the latest features; we are\ntargeting iOS 16 (2022) and have to make huge sacrifices (e.g\nObservable, parameter packs in generics on types). Swift 6 makes a\nmockery of LLMs. It is almost untenable.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn\u2019t the case in the 2010s. The quality and speed of\nimplementation of every iOS app I have ever worked on, in teams of\nevery size, absolutely cooked Android. [...] There has never been\na worse time in the history of computers to launch, and require,\nfundamental and sweeping changes to languages and frameworks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem isn\u2019t necessarily inherent to the design of the Swift language (but, speak",
