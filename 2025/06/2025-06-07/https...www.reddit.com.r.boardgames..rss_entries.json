There were coloured cards with numbers and i think the point of the game was to make a sum, maybe 21 but not 100%. It was a board game, not a pack of cards. It was about 10-15 years ago. Unfortunately because i cant really remember im hoping anything that looks/sounds familiar will just spark my memory to be able to remember wholly.
