I also make youtube videos in those games (most of my time in vr is making yt videos) So because of that i always use a low resolution in my varjo aero so that i can turn up the video settings so it looks better in the video. I have a 4080 super, and running the aero at high res with good graphics is impossible in the games i make yt videos in. So therefore i feel like im wasting my aero if that makes sense, and been thinking of getting something lower res. It can be a pcvr headset that i can slot in with my base stations or i could sell the aero+base stations+controllers, and get something standalone. </p> <p>What do you guys think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/L-mach\"> /u/L-mach </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreali",

First time here and I was really curious about this beautiful VR universe!</p> <p>I&#39;m about to turn 20 this July, and wanted to get a headset as a present from both my parents, but I don&#39;t really know whats hot at the moment model-wise, and I also have a &quot;low&quot; budget (around 300 Euros).</p> <p>What do you recommend buying or at least getting info on? I&#39;m going to mainly use it for single-player games, like job sim and stuff like that.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DryJellyfish1171\"> /u/DryJellyfish1171 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1l5p0ev/budget_vr_headset/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1l5p0ev/budget_vr_headset/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I would just buy into the radius 1 but I usually play co-op with my younger brother and this seems like a fun bonding game! have a quest 3 and he has a quest 3s so we could play together. Is into the radius 2&#39;s horror good enough? Or should we wait? I am mainly wondering about the horror aspects in contrast to the first game. Will it instill the same fear (but if the survival sucks that would be nice to know as well). Last thing is that we have a PC. Would it be worth it to play crossplay? Are the graphics a good enough increase to buy both? Any advice would be great!</p> <p>Edit: there is also a bundle for 60$ which is within my price range.
