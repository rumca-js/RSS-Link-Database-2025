How are they at guessing video games based on their ESRB descriptions? Do they remember the whole launch lineup? How good are they at anagrams? Who can throw a teeshirt further?

        "description": "Dying Light: The Beast expands on the series' zombie-slashing melee action with the addition of guns and Hulk-like super strength, producing some admirably textured combat encounters. \n\nWhen I left my appointment with Techland at gamescom last year, I was somewhat skeptical as to how guns in Dying Light would affect the core ideas. But having had the opportunity to play myself, in which I had the agency to choose when and where guns were deployed, I quickly learned that firearms are just one component of Dying Light: The Beast, not the main attraction. Each combat scenario felt like a problem with a dozen solutions, rather than the melee mosh pits that I typically found myself in while playing Dying Light 2. \n\nAre you excited about Dying Light: The Beast?",
