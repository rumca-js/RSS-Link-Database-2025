There were barracks, a kitchen, a shooting range and other facilities in that base. Because i was a kid i didn&#39;t really know what i was doing but you could shoot everyone and kill them in that base as far as i can remember. It was pretty bloody or gory? I think i was able to talk to some guys in the command center and then went to a mission where you were driven to some point and then the mission started... i can&#39;t remember more. I&#39;m not sure if it was a war between humans or even with some kind of aliens/monsters? The Graphics as i remember them were about the quality of half life 2? Maybe a bit worse..
