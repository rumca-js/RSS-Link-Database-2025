Here\u2019s what I remember: \u2022 It was an M/M romance between two new stepbrothers. \u2022 One of them was blond, very popular, more outgoing. The other was darker, more hostile and mysterious. \u2022 The darker one was very into BDSM and dominant behavior. \u2022 Eventually, they started developing a relationship, with the blond becoming the submissive and the darker one the dominant. \u2022 There were multiple explicit BDSM scenes between them. \u2022 The story was written in English and originally posted on Wattpad.</p> <p>I\u2019ve searched Reddit, Wattpad, Google, everywhere \u2014 but no luck. Has anyone read this? Do you know the title or author?</p> <p>Even if it\u2019s been deleted, any info would help (title, author\u2019s username, or if it\u2019s been reposted somewhere else).</p> <p>Thanks so much \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
