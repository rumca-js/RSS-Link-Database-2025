My approach has some nice benefits, namely:</p> <ol> <li>Just the pods are exposed to the other side of the tunnel and nothing you might not want to be seen.</li> <li>Each ipsec connection is isolated from one another so there is no issue with conflicting subnets.</li> <li>Workload may be on a different node than the one which strongswan is on. This is especially helpful if you only have 1 public IP and a lot of workloads to run.</li> <li>Declarative configuration, it&#39;s all managed with a CRD. </li> </ol> <p>If you&#39;re interested in how it works, it creates an instance of strongswan&#39;s charon (vpn client/",

I&#39;m particularly interested in what you consider your Most Valuable Programs (MVPs) \u2013 the apps you genuinely find essential. This is just a fun project I&#39;ve put together because I&#39;m curious to see which apps people truly value, as opposed to just what&#39;s popular on other lists. It&#39;s primarly focused on user-facing services (think Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Home Assistant), but info on your favorite utility tools is welcome too!</p> <h1>Take the Survey:",

So I decided to build something myself.</p> <p>Meet &quot;Turron&quot; \u2014 a system designed to locate the original video using just a small snippets. Inspired by Shazam, it works by extracting keyframes from the snippet, generating perceptual hashes (using the pHash algorithm), and comparing them against hashes from a known video database using Hamming distance.</p> <p>Yesterday I released v1.0. Right now it works locally with Postgres as the storage backend.
