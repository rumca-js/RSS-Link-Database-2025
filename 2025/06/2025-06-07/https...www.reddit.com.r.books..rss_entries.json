I was familiar with the story and the movie adaptations but I never felt a particular need to read the novel. Nor was I ever made to read it for school. My relationship with the book was peculiar: I knew it existed, I found its plot quite amusing and yet I never sought it out - until I saw it on my university&#39;s library. </p> <p>Truth be said, I&#39;m actually happy I got to read this book at an older age instead of when I was younger. And I&#39;m also happy I got to read it at my own will instead of being made to read it for a school assignment. Had I been pressured to read it, I would definitely end up hating it and I can totally see why many people developed a dislike for it, if school assigned it to them. </p> <p>The story was bizarre in terms of pacing. One moment everything would escalate so quickly and then it would seem like time had stopp",

Ive been getting so many junk books in feeds that Im heading toward buying only independent author books posted before c2020 [with a few exceptions for autbors Ive been following for years] and only books from main publishers for any time after that. If you have a better strategy to identify quality let me know!!</p> <p>There are plenty of great fiction books from the 1900s and early 2000s to work through and they often cost less. </p> <p>Im favoring fiction before c2000 [very roughly before ebooks] as formally published works benefited from good editing.
