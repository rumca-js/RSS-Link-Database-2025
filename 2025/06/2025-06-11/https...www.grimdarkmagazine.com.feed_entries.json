        "description": "<p>Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie that doesn\u2019t need any promotion. It\u2019s widely considered one of the best movies of the 21st century, and with good reason. I&#8217;m a huge post-apocalypse fan. I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;realistic&#8221; apocalypse stories, but I do love stories where it transforms the world into a pseudo-Wild West [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com/review-mad-max-fury-road/\">REVIEW: Mad Max: Fury Road</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.grimdarkmagazine.com\">Grimdark Magazine</a>.</p>",
