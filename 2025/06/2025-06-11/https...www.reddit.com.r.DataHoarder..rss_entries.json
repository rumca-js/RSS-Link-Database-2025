I&#39;m a newbie to all this NAS business, but want to upgrade my drives to the biggest possible drives. I just ordered two 28tb seagate exos (ST28000NM000C) drives off serverpartdeals.com. From reading around on reddit, it seems like these drives are still pretty new and are HAMR drives so people are unsure of their quality and longevity. I guess my main question is if I replace two of my 10tb drives with these and rebuild my raid, if there are any failures with either of the two new drives can I put the either of the original two 10tb drives back in with no data loss? If everything goes well I plan to get two more 28TB drives and take the four 10TB drives plus a few more drives and build another NAS for off-site backup in a raid 6 configuration.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rhork777\"> /u/Rhork777 ",

I had been using it for under a month in my PC internally, and the other day it simply stopped spinning up. I put it in a USB dock and it didn&#39;t work with that either. I can kind of hear a noise when I plug it in, but it&#39;s very faint. Maybe it&#39;s the motor trying to spin up? Not sure.</p> <p>Any idea why this could by? I&#39;ve read about people disabling the 3.3V pin on the SATA power connector with shucked drives - would this technique help with my drive since it was purchased as an internal drive? I would try it, but just left on a trip. Are there any ideas for any other things I could try? I just had some files on the drive I&#39;d like to get back that I hadn&#39;t backed up yet. </p> <p>Thanks so much! I should&#39;ve bought an enterprise drive. I used to test new drives before starting to use them but fell out of the habit lol. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",

It&#39;s meant to be an end-to-end download solution from Kemono and Coomer, loaded with features that will put you in complete control. You can download from creator or post URLs and apply strong filters to scrape content only for certain characters (with group and alias aliases supported), Skip posts containing particular keywords, and choose file types such as images, videos, or archives. For sequential content, a really useful Manga Mode is available that automatically keeps files in order and renames them. It also features high-end options such as powerful folder structuring, multithreading to make it faster, cookie support to access favorite content, an inbuilt error-handling mechanism to re-attempt failed files, and even UI personalization with themes and multiple language support. Hope you&#39;ll find it helpful!</p> <p>Github - <a href=\"https://github.com/Yuvi9587/Ke",
