This makes it easier to transport some games with a bunch of expansions, or just bring along the base game if we&#39;re teaching new players.

Each turn involved declaring movements, then executing them.</p> <p>In the second turn, I believe you could produce new units.</p> <p>The title was something like &quot;Battle for XXX&quot; or &quot;The Battle of XXX&quot;, where &quot;XXX&quot; was the name of a fantasy land (I can\u2019t remember the name).</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a famous game \u2014 I don\u2019t think it was from",
