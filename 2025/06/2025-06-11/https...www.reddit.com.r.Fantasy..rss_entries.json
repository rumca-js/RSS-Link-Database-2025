It&#39;s often philosophical in nature, but not always. </p> <p>The &quot;What if?&quot; thought experiment questions can apply to fantasy, but that&#39;s usually not the purpose.

Things like:</p> <p>1 - Tone (idealism vs. moral complexity)</p> <p>2 - Worldbuilding styles and subgenre blending</p> <p>3 - Pacing or structure</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, examples, or even book recommendations from both periods that highlight these changes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal-Eye630\"> /u/Zealousideal-Eye630 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l8nyr6/how_has_fantasy_literature_changed_over_the_past/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l8nyr6/how_has_fantasy_literature",

I\u2019m curious about The Once and Future King, but like I said, I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll be another difficult read that\u2019ll bore me or I won\u2019t properly understand (I might just be dumb, idk).
