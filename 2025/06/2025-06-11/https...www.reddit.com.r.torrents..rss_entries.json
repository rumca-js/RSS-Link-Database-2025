These were done in a rush before my flight so when I saw the \u201cseeding\u201d option thing on qbittorrent I didn\u2019t have the time so I turned it off. Now I want to turn it back on so I can give back, but I\u2019d like to know the specifics of what it does to my battery, storage, hardware, etc. if any. I have a few specific questions I\u2019d like answered, but if there\u2019s any more info you think would be helpful, please let me know.</p> <ol> <li><p>Do the downloaded files AND the torrent have to be on my laptop to seed? Can I delete the downloaded files that take up GBs of space and still torrent?</p> <ol> <li>I use qbittorrent. Are there any settings I should be aware of?</li> </ol></li> <li><p>When should I seed?
