But I was hoping to build a digital library around XML documents, and I&#39;m finding it surprisingly obtuse to learn how to index (or reverse-index) XML content.</p> <p>My intention is to use a specific form of XML along the lines of JATS or TEI. I want sentence tags nested inside paragraph tags. I also want to use custom character entities to introduce semantic distinctions that aren&#39;t evident from printed form alone, such as end-of-sentence versus abbreviation periods.</p> <p>My goal is to support queries that might be more granular than normal full-text-search, such as: find instances of term A in sentences that also contain term B; or, given a sentence in document D that quotes from citation C, find other locations in other documents that quote from the same source.</p> <p>I&#39;d also like to filter queries by context",
