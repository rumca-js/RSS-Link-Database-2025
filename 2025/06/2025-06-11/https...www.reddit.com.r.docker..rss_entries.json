Hopefully my post is appropriate here since I, for the life of me, cannot seem to get Headscale network running on an Oracle VPS. I want to get everything I did down so I apologize for the post length. Im new to both docker and headscale only having used docker with Unraid. Ditto for Nnginx Proxy Manager.</p> <p>I used this <a href=\"https://wiki.opensourceisawesome.com/books/headscale-for-wireguard/page/headscale-tailscale-clients\">Guide</a> I found along with its accompanying youtube video but cant seem to get a client to connect outside of the VPS. The stack consists of Headscale, Nginx Proxy Manager and then a UI (most likely Headplane or Headscale-Admin but havent gotten to that step yet as Im trying to get the basic config operating first).</p> <p>Basic steps were;</p> <p>- create Oracle VPS on platform. created Network Security Group for instance opening",

To allow other OS to run a docker container, there\u2019s solutions that provide some sort of substitute Linux kernel (fully virtualizing the OS?). At the end of this, the container is essentially running in a Linux environment, right? If you wanted to finally deploy the application in a non-Linux environment, you would have to redo all of the dependency management and stuff (which feels like it defeats the point of docker?), or only use it within the container (which adds overhead that you wouldn\u2019t want to persist in deployment I think?) I think I\u2019m missing some details/not getting things right, and any help would be super appreciated ty!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sqrt-negativeone\"> /u/sqrt-negativeone </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",
