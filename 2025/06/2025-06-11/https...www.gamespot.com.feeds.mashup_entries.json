However, the twist with Cubit Studios' <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/infinitesimals/\">Infinitesimals</a> is that, although the game is set on Earth and told from the point of view of a minuscule hero, it doesn't share Grounded's feelings of a survival game, which border on horror at times. Instead, its mechanics and ubiquitous speed make it all feel like a sandbox full of action figures.</p><p>It makes sense, too.
