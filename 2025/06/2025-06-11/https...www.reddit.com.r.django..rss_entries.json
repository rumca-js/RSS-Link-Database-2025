Essentially what this means is to search for people who are in the jobs that you want (on LinkedIn) yourself. </p> <p>Think about the job titles you can search for such as graduate software engineer, junior developer etc and then when you identify people in these roles, look deeper on LinkedIn for the Engineering Manager/CTO at that company and message them highlighting your skills and experience along with how you found their details. </p> <p>This should put you ahead of the competition the next time that company hires a junior. </p> <p>I elaborated on this technique on my YouTube Channel in this 7 minute video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4MQNaXdnZbU?si=_LdwzqilLLye-i5a\">https://youtu.be/4MQNaXdnZbU?si=_Ldwzqil",
