Nvidia and AI search company Perplexity are teaming up with over a dozen AI firms across Europe and the Middle East to develop localized, sovereign AI models tailored to local languages and cultures. This is a big move to help Europe catch up in AI computing power and build its own AI ecosystem.</p> <p>Nvidia is helping these companies generate synthetic data in languages like French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish languages that typically have less training data available. The goal is to create advanced reasoning AI models that can handle complex tasks in native languages, not just English or Chinese.</p> <p>Once trained, Perplexity will distribute these models so local businesses can run them in their own data centers for tasks like research and automation. Germany is already a major market for Perplexity, showing strong demand.</p> <p>This partnership is part of Nv",

Same thing&#39;s happening with content creation right now.</p> <p>Recent data backs this up - LinkedIn reported that posts using AI assistance but maintaining human editing get 47% more engagement than pure AI content. Meanwhile, Jasper&#39;s 2024 survey found that 89% of successful content creators use AI tools, but 96% say human oversight is &quot;critical&quot; to their process.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been watching creators use AI tools, and the ones who succeed aren&#39;t the ones who just hit &quot;generate&quot; and publish whatever comes out.
