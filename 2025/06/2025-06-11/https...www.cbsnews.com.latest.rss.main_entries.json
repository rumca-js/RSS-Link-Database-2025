And while most of us eventually adapt to a \"new normal,\" one in 10 endures what researchers calls \"complicated grief.\" For them the acute phase of grief never lets up. Susan Spencer investigates the study of grief with Dr. Katherine Shear, and how a website, Modern Loss, is sharing personal stories of grief, loss and coping from around the world, sometimes with unexpected twists. She also talks with columnist Leslie Gray Streeter, who wrote the loss of her husband and came up with a surprising response to her grief.",
