Or an animal (let&#39;s say dragon) who can shift into a humanoid form is also acceptable. Important is that this form is well suited for fighting (again dragons) so turning into a tree is not desired. And yes, I really like dragons but some other form is also okey.</p> <p>One of the issues I ran into when I did the search is that many of those books were very YA or purely romance focused which is not what I am looking for.

Bea never switched her phone off- she made a point of it, especially after that incident where I had forgotten mine when I went to the Gower. She had bought us each one of those charging packs, so we would always have enough battery if we went out for the day. We should never have a reason to be out of contact, unless we had no signal. Why had she turned it off when she went up Lydeard Hill. It was also unusual for her to have gone hiking on her own. Running, yes. But a long walk like that? Never. What had been going on with her that day? There had been too many moments like this in recent weeks, when I felt like I didn\u2019t understand her . When I felt a distance growing between us.

I\u2019m looking for stories that have:</p> <ul> <li>Mystery \u2013 but not super dark, gore-fest level. Think clever, fun, or adventurous mysteries.</li> <li>Romance \u2013 something sweet, not spicy. Like Anne of Green Gables level crushes and relationships, not adult romance.</li> <li>Action \u2013 but without constant swearing or super intense violence. A little cussing is okay, but I don\u2019t want it to be every other word.</li> </ul> <p>Books I\u2019ve read and LOVED:</p> <ul> <li><em>Anne of Green Gables</em> by L.M. Montgomery </li> <li><em>Enola Holmes by Nancy Springer</em></li> <li><em>Damsel by Evelyn Skye</em></li> <li><em>Alone</em> by Megan E. Freeman</li> </ul> <p>If you know of any stories with strong female leads, sibling dynamics, a touch of mystery, some adventure, and maybe a little romance that won\u2019t make me scream \u201cTOO MUCH!\u201d \u2014 please ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello fellow book lovers! I am looking for recommendations for any type of narrative (novel, short story, memoir,etc) in which a character travels to a foreign country for a medical procedure (medical tourism). For example, someone travels to Turkey for hair implants or Colombia for a BBL. The stories could also be in the realm of science fiction too. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a main plot point, as long as there&#39;s travel and medical treatment. </p> <p>I look forward to your suggestions and please let me know if you need more info. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IssueNo6301\"> /u/IssueNo6301 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l8hbls/novels_where_character_travels_for_medical/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l8hbls/novels_where_character_travels_for_medical/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My current favorites are:</p> <p>Jekyll and Hyde (old classic but I LOVED its exploration on the duality of man)</p> <p>Flowers for Algernon (also liked the psychology behind it but also really loved the intrigue of learning the aspects of life i never even thought about)</p> <p>A Gentleman in Moscow (kinda biased bc of my own heritage but loved the exploration of simple humanity even in such a limited setting. Also the poetry in the describtions felt so refreshing and beautiful to me. 10/10). </p> <p>Currently reading the Witcher series and LOVE it so far, but I have literally only just started the Last Wish and progress is slow ",
