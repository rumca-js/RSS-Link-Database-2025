It&#39;s meant to be an end-to-end download solution from Kemono and Coomer, loaded with features that will put you in complete control. You can download from creator or post URLs and apply strong filters to scrape content only for certain characters (with group and alias aliases supported), Skip posts containing particular keywords, and choose file types such as images, videos, or archives. For sequential content, a really useful Manga Mode is available that automatically keeps files in order and renames them. It also features high-end options such as powerful folder structuring, multithreading to make it faster, cookie support to access favorite content, an inbuilt error-handling mechanism to re-attempt failed files, and even UI personalization with themes and multiple language support. Hope you&#39;ll find it helpful!</p> <p>Github - <a href=\"https://github.com/Yuvi9587/Ke",
