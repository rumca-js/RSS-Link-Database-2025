Russell exposes the UK\u2019s new \u201cBrit Card\u201d scheme, revealing how immigration panic, climate fear, and pandemic memories are being weaponized to justify mass surveillance and total control. With Labour pushing ahead and Starmer embracing Blair\u2019s globalist playbook, is this the most dangerous policy since the poll tax? From centralized IDs to biometric tracking, Russell lays out how technocratic tyranny is creeping in\u2014and how we can resist.\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscription\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday - Thursday on Rumble: https://bit.ly/russellbrand-rumble\n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",
