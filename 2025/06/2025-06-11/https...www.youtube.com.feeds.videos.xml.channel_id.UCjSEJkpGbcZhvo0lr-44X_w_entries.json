        "description": "Netbird is an AWESOME tool for remote connecting into devices, networks, and peers. Better yet, it's open source and they give the option to completely self-host it. No centralized VPN server with NetBird as your devices and networks connect to each other directly over a fast encrypted tunnel. Creating a high-performance point-to-point WireGuard overlay network that connects machines running anywhere in just a few clicks.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 RESOURCES\nWebsite: https://netbird.io/\nGithub: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird\nDocs: https://docs.netbird.io/\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 FOLOW TECHHUT\nX (Twitter): https://bit.ly/twitter-techhut\nMASTODON: https://bit.ly/mastodon-techhut\nBlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/techhut.bsky.social\nINSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/personal-insta\n\n\ud83d\udc4f SUPPORT TECHHUT (all links below this line will earn us commission)\nBUY A COFFEE: https://buymeacoffee.com/techhut\nYOUTUBE MEMBER: https://bit.ly/members-techhut\n\n\u2014PAID/AFFILIATE LINKS BELOW\u2014\n\ud83d\udece RECOMMENDED SERVICES\nVPN I USE: https://airvpn.org/?referred",
