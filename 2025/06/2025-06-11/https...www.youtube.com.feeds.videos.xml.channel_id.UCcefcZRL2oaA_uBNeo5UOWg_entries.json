        "description": "Michael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, joins Garry to talk about building one of the fastest-growing startups of all time\u2014and why he's betting on a future beyond code. He walks through the early insights that led his team to leave a promising AI-powered CAD project and instead chase a bigger dream: reinventing how software is written. \n\nFrom years of false starts and rewrites to Cursor's breakthrough moment, Michael explains what it takes to build a tool that could eventually replace programming as we know it. He also reflects on their first 10 hires, why taste still matters and how the decade ahead will unlock a new kind of creativity for builders everywhere.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/\nWork at a startup: https://www.ycombinator.com/jobs\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:00 - A new way to build software\n02:00 - Cursor\u2019s mission\n03:40 - The downside of vibe coding\n04:50 - Two ways to view LLMs\n05:50 - Bottlenecks to superhu",
