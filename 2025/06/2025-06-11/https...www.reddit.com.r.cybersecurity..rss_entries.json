Yesterday I closed approx 60 tickets just to try and keep my head above water. Other L1s and L2s are the same. We are getting very little support from mgmt, in fact, we ate being told to work faster and stop letting things sit for too long.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also been told I need to pass at least 2 exams by EOY.</p> <p>Am I out of my depth, is the work unreasonable? I&#39;m really fucking doubting myself right now. Are all SOCs like this?

This includes shutting off the engine, disabling the brakes, unlocking doors, cutting the brakes while in use, and essentially manipulating any function the device controls within the vehicle.</p> <",

I am currently a Sr. Cybersecurity Analyst and fortunate enough to have the opportunity to decide my next role/title as we grow.</p> <p>My VP has the idea of me taking on as the SOC Manager, which would be a faster transition with his help, but I have been interested in potentially becoming a Cybersecurity Engineer.</p> <p>I like the technical side of things and owning my own work/projects. Not really hyped to manage people but I can and do with my interns at least.</p> <p>I make about 145k now with base and bonuses. Our Network Security Engineer started at 160k base alone as is why I became interested.</p> <p>Anyone have experience in either role? Which role you would pick?
