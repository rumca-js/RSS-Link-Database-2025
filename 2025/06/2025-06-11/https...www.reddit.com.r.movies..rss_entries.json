Although its world premiere was at the Cannes Film Festival on May 26, it was on that June 11th that the world truly began to fall in love with the tiny alien with the bright eyes and giant heart.

There&#39;s no TV or streaming service that supports that combo anymore.</p> <p>The scenes were framed and shot with 3D depth in mind. The HFR made everything look hyper-clear, which exposed the CGI and costumes. It gave off that &quot;video game&quot; feel, but it was at least a bold choice.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t love the 3D, but I found the 48fps interesting.
