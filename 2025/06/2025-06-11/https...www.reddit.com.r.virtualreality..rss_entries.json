This was a release title for the CV1 and is still one of the most clean and polished games for VR. It&#39;s extremely well optimized, intensely satisfying, and helped establish some of the movement mechanics and interactions that became standard in the genre.</p></li> <li><p>AirCar. This is a very early yet remarkably effective experience where you fly around in a airborne cargo vehicle. There is no dialogue or story, just a simple blue cyberpunk city in the dark rain. There are no comfortability settings, which only makes the disorienting yet smooth flying even more immersive.</p></li",

This will be my first vr system i own, but i have had experience before(older system(htc) and quest2). I have found deals (lightly used index(with 2.0 base stations) and quest3 for 600eur and 500eur respectively) i plan to play roomscale(playing space is ~2x2.5m) and seated experiences on pcvr(and if quest then maybe some standalone games). I don&#39;t have glasses and ipd is around 65mm. Only have a pc (4070ti super 16gb, ryzen 5 7600x, 32gb 6000hz ram and m.2 ssd storage) i plan to use the vr headset when and if i can(probably split computer time/vr time 70/30). in my opinion the quest 3 might be the better purchase because of the ability to still connect wired/wireless(for extra cost) to a pc but since steam games will be the primary use scenario maybe it is more worth to get the index? any other recommendations in the &lt;700 euro range will be appreciated",
