The thing is, after i installed the drivers, my external monitor couldn&#39;t do 1080p 144hz anymore and I had to go to 120Hz, not much of an issue. The thing is that in games that dont have a refresh rate setting, the default refresh rate in games for steam seems to be 60Hz and I know this by using mangohud and enabling vsync in game and seeing the fps drop to 58-60. The thing is, the laptop refresh rate seems fine, but if i enable vsync on the laptop screen it still goes to 58-60 fps, weird (on games without refresh rate setting). I tried using gamescope in steam launch arguments but no game starts after using gamescope %command% or gamescope -r 120 -- %command% or smth like that. I am using proton ge 10.4 but i tried launch args with proton 9 and beta 10. Any idea what I can do or try? Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",

Everything&#39;s been running great so far, but I\u2019m looking for <strong>a way to limit the battery charge to a specific threshold</strong>, like 80%, to help preserve battery health.</p> <p>I know that <strong>TLP</strong> is commonly recommended for battery management on Linux, but when I install it, it <strong>disables</strong> <code>power-profiles-daemon</code>, which I&#39;d rather keep. So, I&#39;m wondering if is <strong>there any good alternative to TLP that allows setting battery charge limits without interfering with power-profiles-daemon.</strong></p> <p>Also, since this is my first time using a laptop as my main computer (I\u2019ve always used desktops), I\u2019d really appreciate any <strong>care tips</strong>, especially for gaming. I usually play while plugged into power, and only use the battery when working or doing lighter tasks.</p> <p>I&#39;m mostly worried abo",
