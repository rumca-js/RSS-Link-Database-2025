I can\u2019t send her any of this stuff\u201d and I kid you not, not even sixty seconds after I thought that I start getting reels like \u201csend this to a girl who makes you smile\u201d and romantic stuff.

When I report it to TikTok, they won\u2019t take down the account nor the post. So hopefully posting to here will garner more attention and concern. They are using the typical symbols like pizza and the blue swirl. But now they have been also using the milk bottles emoji, football, and the cheery emoji. They also use picture of the adult actor Austin Wolfe who was recently arrest for possession on C-P.

I mean event managers literally sent text messages before the festival warning that death was likely, and they literally did nothing.</p> <p>And the documentary showed that there were a number of people calling for the concert to be stopped during the event. They literally knew what was happening, the police, paramedics, show organizers, everyone, they knew! Yet only 2 people at Live Nation had the authority to stop the show and all they did was bring out Drake knowing it would cause even more chaos in the crowd.</p> <p>The whole thing was really creep",
