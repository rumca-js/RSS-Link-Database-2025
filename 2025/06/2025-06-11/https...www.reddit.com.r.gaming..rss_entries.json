It&#39;s a joy to construct the layout of your installations then zip around the map laying down real-time fire to quell the nearly insurmountable vicious enemy siege. Aside from the gameplay itself, these titles have killer music, terrific art design and wonderfully charming atmospheres that make them feel as though they were lovingly crafted in the 90&#39;s; both titles were developed by Exor Studios.

Played through it... It&#39;s painfully noticeable that this is a port of a mobile game adapted to PC. Especially from the unresponsive controls on the menu, which, surprise surprise, are much better manageable with mouse and keyboard than joystick, because they were designed originally with a touchscreen in mind. After some research it turns out that this is indeed a port of a mobile game, without the gacha elements and turned into a souls like of some sorts. It used to be called Solo Leveling Arise but they added the Overdrive to make it a standalone version from the gacha game. I&#39;ll be honest. The game...absolutely sucks. The story feels inexistent, the gameplay is kinda satisfying but the scenarios and characters feel very uninspired and soulless. It just failed to pull me in. Even i",
