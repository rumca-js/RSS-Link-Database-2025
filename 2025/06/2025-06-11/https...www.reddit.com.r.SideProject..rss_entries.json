When it\u2019s time to export, they can choose from a range of templates (IEEE paper, thesis, etc.).</p> <p>A few highlights:</p> <ul> <li>It uses a custom-built block editor that performs well with large documents.

Basically, it&#39;s an AI thingy that lets you write a post <em>once</em> and then sends it out to all the best subreddits for you... (Thinking about adding Discord and other platforms down the line, but Reddit&#39;s the main focus for now). The whole idea came from me being super lazy (and busy!) trying to post my stuff everywhere. You know how it&#39;s \u2013 spending ages figuring out what subredits are good, then trying to re-word your post for each one so it doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re spamming. Risero kinda handles all that. It sniffs out the best subreddits for your content, tweaks your post to match their vibe (so you don&#39;t sound like a total bot), and even schedules it for when people are actually online. Goal&#39;s to get better results without, well, sounding like a spammy bot... What&#39;s it doing right now... Well, it&#39;ll suggest",
