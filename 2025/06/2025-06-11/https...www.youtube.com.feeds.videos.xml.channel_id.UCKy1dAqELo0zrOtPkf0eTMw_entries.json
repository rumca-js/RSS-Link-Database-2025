But at the same time, writer/director Dean DeBlois\u2019 re-creation of a story he first told 15 years ago shows he still has a lot of affection for this world and these characters, and that gives this How to Train Your Dragon an impressive amount of resonance. Within all its rigid recitation, there\u2019s a heart and soul that demonstrates how DeBlois has managed to get so much mileage out of the loving story of a Viking boy and the dragon he befriends.",
