Apparently not! I got the raspberry pi zero 2 w to run pi hole on my network. Was going to follow the instructions for setting up the pi itself and then for pi hole and was going to run it headless. OS was the recommended 32 bit lite and I configured the SSH settings(username, password, hostname etc), enabled SSH and made sure my wifi name and password were correct. I&#39;ve downloaded imager, I have the wpa_supplicant.conf and ssh file in the boot folder. Plugged the pi into a power source, slapped the micro sd in there and... nothing. Nada. Zilch. </p> <p>Okay, I&#39;ll do some more fenageling. Nope! Realized my wifi SSIDs was running on the same name, but my specific hub does not allow me to assign separate names and it seems like they run congruently ie. depending on the device and where it is in relation to the hub.
