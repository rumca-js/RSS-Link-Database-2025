The site has English as the primary language, with Traditional Chinese and Vietnamese as secondary languages. Canonical tags and <code>hreflang</code> (including <code>x-default</code>) are configured per language.</p> <p>The site was indexed fine at first, but since February, Google Search Console frequently shows this error:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Duplicate, Google chose different canonical than user</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve double-checked the <code>canonical</code> tags and <code>hreflang</code> setup, but the warning keeps popping up.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear if anyone has experienced similar issues with multilingual SEO on WordPress, or if there are known compatibility quirks with TranslatePress + AIOSEO.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! And apologies if I missed anything in the rules \u2014 this is my first post here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
