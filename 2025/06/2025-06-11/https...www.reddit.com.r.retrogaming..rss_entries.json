        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Growing up on nes, SNES , Sega ect it&#39;s wild to me how far gaming has come in terms of beating games. It wasn&#39;t at all unusual, at least among people I knew to have owned a game as a kid, but never actually beating it. Some of these games many adults still never have come back to beating( nes oh turtles game I&#39;m looking at you.). Maybe it&#39;s old head talk after some drinks , but bringing up some of those era games is a badge of honor not as commonly shared as finishing the games of today.</p> <p>Now I feel like not finishing a game is pretty much for reasons of not liking the game more than anything else. Hell sometimes people don&#39;t just beat games, but they 100% them and do crazy challenges on top of it. </p> <p>Just weird to think of the amount of games now that it&#39;s not about if you were able to finish it, but when and how it was. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Divine_F",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Having a discussion IRL about these two games. The OG Mario is a classic that propelled video gaming into a lot of our lives\u2026 but it\u2019s easily out classed by its sequels and other 8 bit platformers. OG Zelda on the other hand was mind blowing, it was like a whole world lived in that cartridge and there was so much to see and uncover\u2026 but some of it is incredibly opaque without a strategy guide and the combat is pretty janky at times.</p> <p>So\u2026 what do you think?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/1l8hihq\">View Poll</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/styxswimchamp\"> /u/styxswimchamp </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l8hihq/settle_an_argument_which_nes_game_is_better_smb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l8hihq/settle_an_argument_which_nes_game_is_better_smb/\">[comments]</a></span>",
