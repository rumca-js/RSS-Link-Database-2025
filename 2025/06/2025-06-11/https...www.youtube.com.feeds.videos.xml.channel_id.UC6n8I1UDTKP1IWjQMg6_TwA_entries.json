        "description": "June 14 marks eight years since London's Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people lost their lives. Today, 2,919 nights on, thousands are still going to bed in dangerous buildings, unable to get them remediated because of disputes between landlords, freeholders and building owners over who should foot the bill. \n\nIn one of the hardest videos we have ever produced, we've looked back at the Grenfell Tower tragedy, exploring what happened on that dreadful night, what has happened since, who - if anyone - has been held to account, and the impact the disaster has had on the UK as it continues to grapple with a widespread cladding crisis. The result is a difficult watch, but one that we should all take the time to digest to ensure something like this can never happen again. \n\nThe video is now available to watch on @TheB1M channel.",
