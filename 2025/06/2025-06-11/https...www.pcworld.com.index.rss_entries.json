Cloud services are convenient but can be unreliable, and they can take much longer depending on your internet connection. That\u2019s why I always recommend having a high-speed flash drive on hand, like this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Extreme-Solid-State/dp/B08GY3Z4JR/\">256GB SanDisk Extreme Pro that\u2019s on sale for $40 on Amazon</a>. Normally $60, you can now snag it for 33% off\u2014and it\u2019s worth every cent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This high-speed USB 3.2 flash drive is built for fast file transfers. Whether you need to copy/paste some files for work, move 4K videos to your media server, back up large photo collections, or whatever else, this drive can handle it in seconds or minutes, not hours. With up to 420 MB/s data transfer speeds, you\u2019ll barely see that file trans",
