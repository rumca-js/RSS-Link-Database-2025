They are being sold for $100 individually and $250 for all 3. I know nothing about enterprise machines since I have only worked on commercial machines for gaming and general media consumption. I&#39;m still trying to learn what is good and what is not good, and what is needed for everything I want to do. But at the same time, this looks like a REALLY good deal so I don&#39;t want to just sit here and research just for them to be sold before I can figure out if it&#39;s actually worth buying.</p> <p>I want to use one of them as a dedicated NAS/media server for me and my partner.

I don&#39;t recall ever having seen an I/O error in the log with just those 8 drives configured. Recently, I wanted to add some higher bandwidth SAS SSD storage for video editing over 10GbE. I found a good source for 3.84TB HPE proliant 6gbps SAS SSDs. All 6 SSDs have (what I think) is relatively low on time for 9 year old enterprise drives - about ~1.5 years total power on",

My parents, brother, and girlfriend all use my server regularly (which I believe worked because I set up Jellyfin, Immich, Vaultwarden, and LubeLogger for myself and them), but I invited my close group of friends to use Jellyfin and Jellyseerr about a week ago, in a concise message, and they all ghosted me about it lol. I have about 40 TB of media and room for much more. I want to share it, but blasting it on my Instagram is too much, too.</p> <p>Who else uses your server, and how do you usually get people interested in trying it out? I&#39;m genuinely curious to hear about your experiences.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nothingveryobvious\"> /u/nothingveryobvious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l8gmx7/who_else_uses_your_servers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l8gmx7/who_else_uses_your_s",

I am currently running into some hiccups and unfortunately for me there is ZERO documentation on how this works with truenas scale. You are suppose to only configure the container via the truenas scale GUI.</p> <p>I have a optical drive connected to the truenas server via a usb connection. ARM is able to eject and close the disc, but anytime MakeMKV starts it fails almost as if it doesn&#39;t see the drive. Has anyone ever ran into this issue?
