        "description": "Scientists have discovered a giant planet orbiting a tiny red dwarf star, something they believed wasn t even possible. The planet, TOI-6894b, is about the size of Saturn but orbits a star just a fifth the mass of our Sun. This challenges long-standing ideas about how big planets form, especially around small stars. Current theories can't fully explain how such a planet could have taken shape. Even more fascinating, this cold planet may have a rare kind of atmosphere rich in methane or even ammonia something we've never seen in an exoplanet before.",

        "description": "A team of scientists has identified specialized neurons in the brain that store \"meal memories\" detailed recollections of when and what we eat. These engrams, found in the ventral hippocampus, help regulate eating behavior by communicating with hunger-related areas of the brain. When these memory traces are impaired due to distraction, brain injury, or memory disorders individuals are more likely to overeat because they can't recall recent meals. The research not only uncovers a critical neural mechanism but also suggests new strategies for treating obesity by enhancing memory around food consumption.",

        "description": "A popular fat found in olive oil may not be as innocent as it seems. Scientists discovered that oleic acid, a major component of many high-fat foods, uniquely spurs the growth of new fat cells by manipulating specific proteins in the body. Unlike other fats, it boosts the number of \"fat cell soldiers,\" setting the stage for obesity and possibly chronic diseases. This unexpected twist reveals that the type of fat we eat, not just how much, may play a crucial role in our health.",

Scientists discovered a unique sugar in these marine creatures that can block Sulf-2, an enzyme that cancer cells use to spread. Unlike traditional medications, this compound doesn t cause dangerous blood clotting issues and offers a cleaner, potentially more sustainable way to develop carbohydrate-based drugs if scientists can find a way to synthesize it in the lab.",

Researchers uncover seven distinct forms of corruption threatening the integrity of the state s clean energy expansion, including favoritism, land grabs, and misleading environmental claims. Perhaps most eyebrow-raising are allegations of romantic entanglements between senior officials and solar lobbyists, blurring the lines between personal influence and public interest. The report paints a picture of a solar sector racing ahead while governance and ethical safeguards fall dangerously behind.",

This polarized light scattered by the universe's very first stars over 13 billion years ago offers a new lens into the Cosmic Dawn. Overcoming extreme technical challenges, the CLASS team matched their data with satellite readings to isolate this ancient signal. These insights could reshape our understanding of the universe s early evolution, and what it reveals about mysterious components like dark matter and neutrinos.",

Even better, this trick doesn't require a matching increase in energy use. The discovery not only challenges long-held beliefs about how clocks and physics work, but could also lead to powerful new tools in science, technology, and beyond.",
