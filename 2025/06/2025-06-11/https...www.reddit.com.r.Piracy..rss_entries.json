So, I&#39;m looking at adding a movie to my collection-- Kraven the Hunter to be exact-- and I&#39;m specifically looking for this movie in SDR, as my current TV doesn&#39;t support HDR. I was pretty bummed to find out that there doesn&#39;t seem to be an SDR copy of the movie in 4k outside of a WEB-DL, but I did happen to notice that a remux does exist in SDR for the movie, only it&#39;s in 1080p...Now, for all my cinephilles, and tech-enthusiasts, I was hoping if you wouldn&#39;t mind sparring some knowledge regarding this matter. Would it be best to prioritize the WEB-DL just because of the sheer resolution? Or would the remux edge it out because it&#39;s source is more superior? Anything helps, Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thoughtzthrukeyz\"> /u/thoughtzthrukeyz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1l8mjcy/2160p_sdr_webdl_vs_1080p_s",
