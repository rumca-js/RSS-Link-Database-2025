        "description": "11 bit studios' The Alters has seen its share of delays, and things seemed a bit worrying for the social survival title. Fortunately, the results have proven more positive than expected, with the story, characters, and core concept turning out well.\n\nYou're Jan Dolski, stranded on a mysterious planet and struggling to escape a hostile sun in a moving base. With the entire crew gone, it's up to you alone to manage - an insurmountable task if not for a specific material, which allows Jan to create Alters of himself. These can range from scientists and engineers to botanists and even counsellors.\n\nIt also opens up a whole can of worms for his current predicament, and in narrative terms, this is executed exceedingly well. The only real mark against The Alters is its gameplay, which doesn't aspire to much the typical resource gathering. Otherwise, in terms of its sci-fi premise which is really more about the human condition, it's well worth checking out.",

        "description": "The only other complaint I have with Street Fighter 6 is not a complaint with the Switch 2 version, but with Street Fighter 6 as a whole: its lack of cross-save and cross-progression means that even players who may have already sunk inordinate hours into this game will be starting from scratch on the Switch 2. \n\nIt is to the game's credit that all the DLC and updates ever released for this game are included, and at such a reasonable asking price, so to its credit, they have tried to soften that blow. But I imagine that will give a lot of fans at least some pause.",

        "description": "MindsEye looks amazing. Its open world is pretty, its cutscenes are expertly crafted and there is an intriguing story here. But everything else is more or less a disaster. \n\nCombat mechanics are bland, third person shooting lacks any sort of feedback and impact, enemy AI is horrendouds, PC performance has issues and a world that looks so beautiful yet so shallow.\n\nMindsEye is a classic example of having more style and substance. Check out more about MindsEye in our review.",
