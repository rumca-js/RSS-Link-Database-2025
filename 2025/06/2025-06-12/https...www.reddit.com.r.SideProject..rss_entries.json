Passengers in these buses will be the target audience here. We ensure controlled 1:1 delivery of bottles, ensuring the appropriate targeting of ad is done.<br/> Advertisers can choose routes, buses, time of the week (even day at times), etc. as distribution customisation and even track the performance of their campaign.</p> <p>You also have other distribution places like gyms, ",

For some context, I\u2019m an intern at a small startup in SF for the summer and I don\u2019t really know the place well or have many friends in the area. I spent a lot of time either in my apartment, wanting to explore but feeling lost on where to go. So over this past week, I created an app to help you discover new places, maintain a digital passport of your travels, and compile a travel journal to share your journey. </p> <p>Wanderlust allows you to turn real-world exploration into a game, with every step or trip uncovering a part of the map -- think google maps + flighty + instagram. The app is privacy focused with all data being stored locally and only optional aggregate stats being shared. Through the fog-of-war like effect, it can help plan visits to a new spot rather than not knowing where to begin at all. </p> <p>If this sounds interesting, join the waitlist here: <a href=\"https://www.getwanderlust.org/\">https://www.getwanderlust.org/</a>.</p>",

I\u2019d love your thoughts before diving in.</p> <p>The backstory</p> <p>For years, my friend and I have had this weird hobby: we invent strange, specific superpowers and then brainstorm all the bizarre ways you could use them. We\u2019ll bounce ideas off each other\u2014starting with the obvious and eventually spiraling into completely uncharted territory. It\u2019s like a fun mental sport. But we always wondered: how would our ideas stack up against what other people might come up with if they were given the same challenge?</p> <p>You know those Reddit threads where someone posts a hyper-specific power and the comments explode with hilarious or brilliant takes? I love those. So I started wondering\u2014what if that kind of creative chaos could be turned into a daily game?</p> <p>The idea is als",

I figured it\u2019s better to be honest than sneaky.</p> <p>I wanted to share something I\u2019ve been working on. It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.aiflyer.ai\">AIflyer</a>, a graphic design tool where you just <em>text</em> what you want (like \u201cflyer for a weekend sale at my bakery\u201d) and it generates a professional design in seconds.</p> <p>I made it because most tools out there either take too long or produce stuff that looks <em>very</em> AI-generated. I wanted something faster than Canva and cleaner than most AI design tools.</p> <p>If you run a business, make content, or have an event, I\u2019d love for you to check it out. Even just feedback means a lot.</p> <p>And if this post feels like too much, just let me know and I\u2019ll take it down. I\u2019m just here trying to grow the right way.</p> <p>Thanks for reading \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",
