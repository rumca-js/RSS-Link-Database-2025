Meanwhile a new round of talks between Iran and the U.S. are scheduled for the weekend and President Trump says he is preventing Israel from striking Iran and he wants to see cooperation. We hear the latest developments and the voices of average Iranians who seem unfazed by news from the talks.",

He was deported to a supermax prison in El Salvador despite a protective order that he should remain in the U.S. <br><br>But then \u2013 less than a month after his arrest, a federal judge and then the Supreme Court ruled the government should facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S.  <br><br>Now nearly three months after Abrego Garcia was sent to a prison in another country... he's back on US soil. <br><br>What happens now?<br><br>For sponsor-free episodes",
