        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been an avid collector for years, but am in the need to downsize and sell a decent amount of my collection. I&#39;m still holding onto some favorites, but about 3/4 of my collection has got to go. I&#39;m not super into the idea of Feebay eating up my profits with fees, and I don&#39;t want to sell it all at a game shop for 60% value. Been out of the buying and selling game for a while, what are the best apps, websites, subreddits, etc for selling retro gaming stuff these days to maximize profits and minimize hassle?

I had a run on Gabby Jay for Super Punch Out that was SO FAST I was better than all the times in the Nintendo power rankings, and then my douche friend deleted my saved game by making a new one over the top. The time is still on my cart, but it says &quot;Mario&quot; as the name. :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Temporary_Bad_1438\"> /u/Temporary_Bad_1438 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l9aiay/gaming_data_loss_support_group/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l9aiay/gaming_data_loss_support_group/\">[comments]</a></span>",
