What I mean by that is that I have more than one machine, and I usually have a <code>dotfiles</code> folder under version control which i deploy with GNU Stow.</p> <p>Among the things that I like about standalone WM is that I can just have a configuration file and easily have the same configs and keybindings on multiple machines. With desktop environments, however this is usually a pain, I must re-configure the desktop environment and the keybindings on any new machine (such a waste of time!).</p> <p>In your experience, which dekstop environment is the most portable, whose configs are easiest to backup under version control and deploy on different machines?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bortolo_II\"> /u/Bortolo_I",
