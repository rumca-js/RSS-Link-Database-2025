In case anyone thinks that because I use em dashes this is an AI piece, no. I&#39;m a good writer.</p> <p>Note: <em>Weird</em> in the title means fate, as in the expression &quot;to dree one&#39;s weird,&quot; or suffer one&#39;s fate.</p> <p>Along with writers like Wilkie Collins, Braddon is an important figure in the sensationalist novels of the 19th century, her most well-known work being <em>Lady Audley&#39;s Secret</em>. Such novels, with their themes of family secrets, murder, infidelity, insanity, and so on, placed not in Gothic castles but ordinary domestic settings, were also early examples of detective stories. As the helpful foreword points out, <em>Wyllard&#39;s Weird</em> predates the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes by only two years. </p> <p",
