Behind the scenes, these treasures solve real-world problems, like helping planes avoid birds and identifying invasive species threatening agriculture. Now, the museum is tackling one of its most ambitious projects ever: assembling a DNA library of every complex life form on Earth. We went behind the scenes to see how breakthroughs in AI, high-resolution imaging, and robotics make that possible.\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:26 - Hidden Collections\n03:06 - Preserving Specimens\n04:36 - Digitization Project\n05:20 - Breaking Down Dietary Fats\n06:20 - Feather ID Lab\n08:48 - L.A.B. - Laboratories Of Analytical Biology\n10:58 - Earth BioGenome Project\n13:30 - Environmental DNA (eDNA)\n18:21 - How Collections Help Humans\n19:35 - Protecting Crops From Invasive Species\n21:52 - The Future \n23:28 - Where Are The Giant Humanoid Skeletons?\n23:52 - Credits\n\n-------------------",
