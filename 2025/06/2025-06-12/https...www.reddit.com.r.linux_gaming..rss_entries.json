This seems like a common problem, and on the ProtonDB page for 2k25 it seems like the common issue is with NVidia cards, the AMD cards seem to be working fine. </p> <p>Are Nvidia cards just a bad match for Linux gaming?

As far as I can tell, all of the memory reduction options steam used to have (that I had used for a different arch install back in 2023, where i got the client usage down to like 200-400mb ram), are all gone and no longer working. like disabling the browser, running the old steam ui, etc. Is there anything that is currently functional to reduce the overall ram usage, or is it cooked.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CoolPenguin42\"> /u/CoolPenguin42 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1l9v4gl/is_there_any_working_ways_at_all_for_re",

My mouse cursor is the only thing that is 144hz. I have turned off composition on fullscreen. The only game that runs on 144hz is minecraft only on full screen. It may have something to do with the fact that I have another monitor which is 60hz but I have checked settings and it&#39;s set to 144hz or maybe because I have dual boot to windows. Plasma also didn&#39;t help. It seems that all of the steam games won&#39;t display at 144hz for me.
