However, with qphotoreq_win, I found my deleted file, and it had the same amount of memory that it previously had. However, the video was now 5 hours long without showing a picture. I assume it&#39;s because my recovered .mov file isn&#39;t working in Recoverit. After all, it&#39;s missing the moov atom. Recoverit uses a sample file to rebuild that stru",

Cleaning it up slowly, but long term, I will need a different solution. FD Define 7 XL currently.</p> <p>Additionally I have a 330 (270 TB usable, 80-ish percent full ) offsite server, 10G unmetered, which I could expand to 400-ish TB usable before having to physically swap hardware. That would be a short term solution. I would very much prefer to get something new/refurbed and lease it as long as it has the ability to house up to 1 PB, so I don&#39;t have to worry as I do now.</p> <p>I do require both onsite and offsite storage. However, the onsite storage has to be silent, so a proper storagebox like a Dell Powerscale is out of the question for onsite. Maybe remote/offsite.</p> <p>SAS/SATA is perfectly fine, not looking for SSDs",
