As a female reader, I don&#39;t find myself unable to relate to Eragon, but am curious as to what you all think, especially in light of the knowledge that male speculative fiction readership is down.

I really loved Diana Wynne Jones growing up -- my favourites were House of Many Ways and Conrad&#39;s Fate. I think I loved the slower pacing, and how plots were often organized around exploring an interesting location and figuring out how magic worked. I remember really getting lost in these books, and I can&#39;t really think of any adult fantasy that feels similar, except for maybe Gormenghast, in some twisted and dark way?
