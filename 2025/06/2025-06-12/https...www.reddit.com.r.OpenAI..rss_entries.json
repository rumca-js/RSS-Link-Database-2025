Or at the very least, let users choose between a fast, non-reasoning model and a more advanced reasoning model when using voice.</p> <p>Right now, AVM is great for casual, fast responses, but it&#39;s still based on a lightweight model that doesn&#39;t handle deep reasoning or memory. This works fine for simple conversations, but ChatGPT Plus users, especially those using GPT-4o, should absolutely have the option to switch to a reasoning model when needed.</p> <p>Google has already done this in AI Studio with Gemini. They let users pick between &quot;chat&quot; and &quot;reasoning&quot; modes, and it makes a noticeable difference for tasks like coding help, step-by-step problem-solving, or more thoughtful discussion.</p> <p>OpenAI should give us that same flexibility in voice mode. Even if it&#39;s not the default, a toggle would be a huge improvement.</p",
