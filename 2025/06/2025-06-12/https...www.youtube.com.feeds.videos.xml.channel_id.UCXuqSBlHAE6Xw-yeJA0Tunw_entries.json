The hardware impressed us, and some of the features were genuinely great, but clunky UI quirks, frustrating compatibility problems, and unreliable Wi-Fi on a $10,000 Mac Pro reminded us that macOS still has its issues. We break down what worked, what didn\u2019t, and why at least one of us hasn\u2019t switched back.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1614927-i-don%E2%80%99t-hate-my-mac-switching-to-apple-pt-2/\n\nCheck out the M4 MacBook Pro: https://geni.us/314j3\nCheck out the M2 MacBook Air: https://geni.us/SB839\n\n\u25ba GET OUR MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba GET A VPN: http://www.piavpn.com/linus\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\nCHAPTERS\n---------",
