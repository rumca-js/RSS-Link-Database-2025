I personally believe that mTLS (if supported by the app developer) is the best way. However, this involves creating a CA and managing user certificates. While not difficult per se, it is a hassle having to keep track of expiration dates, copying pkcs12 files as well as managing OpenSSL. Current solution such as certgen do not provide a web interface and others like EJBCA are too much for a simple setup. Thus I created VaulTLS, a certificate management designed for simple deployment and management.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>VaulTLS</strong> is a modern solution for managing mTLS (mutual TLS) certificates with ease. It provides a centralized platform for generating, managing, and distributing client TLS certificates for your home lab.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd12 mTLS client and",
