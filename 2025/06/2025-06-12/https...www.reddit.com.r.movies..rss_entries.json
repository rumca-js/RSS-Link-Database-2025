A few weeks ago, I was recovering from surgery and couldn\u2019t do anything to pass the time but watch movies, so I watched some longer films, one of which was a rewatch of Beau.</p> <p>This time around, I loved it. It has slowly become one of my favorite modern films. I can always get thoroughly absorbed in the world building, and I love that I\u2019m basically getting a surreal nightmare triptych starring one of my favorite actors in the lead role. </p> <p>I believe Beau will receive its \u201cFire Walk With Me\u201d renaissance one day. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheReliableNarrator\"> /u/TheReliableNarrator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l9chcf/how_is_everybody_feeling_abo",
