We want it to be multifunctional game/bar/hangout room. We play a lot of board games. Once in awhile we have others but our main focus is a room that is functional for us the 99% of the time it\u2019s just us. Thoughts on having two comfortable accent chairs and a big coffee table in the middle of the room? We have 4 pets that are constantly in and out of the room. I\u2019d rather not have a big dining-like table and chairs for board games. We will also have a little bar setup, a dart board and hopefully one day a bubble hockey table. Any pictures of your own spaces or thoughts for you to share are appreciated! Pictures are of the room as it is now (+ pet tax).</p",

I own the full Marvel Champions collection, and sometimes I just want to know how much of it I\u2019ve really played \u2014 or I\u2019m just trying to set up a scenario I haven\u2019t touched yet. Same with Spirit Island \u2014 ever wonder how many possible combos you\u2019ve tried? Or how many are still sitting there untouched? </p> <p>That\u2019s what led me to start working on a tool to help with this. Not ready to show anything yet, but I\u2019d love to hear how others approach the same problem. What helps, what gets in the way, what you wish existed. </p> <p>If that sounds familiar, here\u2019s a short 3\u20134 min survey:<br/> <a href=\"https://forms.gle/H65PwgUPRzgtTvcT8\">https://forms.gle/H65PwgUPRzgtTvcT8</a> </p> <p>Thanks \u2014 and feel free to pass it on to others who might relate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thitemple\"> /u/thitemple </a> <br/> <span",
