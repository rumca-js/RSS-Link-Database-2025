Everything went fine until the CSS. I looked at tutorials and they told me to do the &lt;link&gt; thing, so I did. But it won&#39;t work for some reason and I believe it is because of the different folders. The website I&#39;m working on is in the folder &quot;html&quot; and the CSS file is in the folder &quot;CSS&quot;. I&#39;ve been told to use .. and / to change the level but it somehow still doesn&#39;t work. Please help!! I need this done by tomorrow",
