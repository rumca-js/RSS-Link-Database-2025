        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Nintendo Switch 2 feels like a victim of Nintendo's own history, having set decades-long expectations that new hardware will always be, if not always revolutionary, at least deeply strange. The Wii, DS, 3DS, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch each relied on some central gimmick that was new and novel. Nintendo made a name for itself creating not just games but entirely new ways to play. The Switch 2, by comparison, is an iterative step--a more powerful successor to its wildly popular predecessor. While some may lament that this isn't the system to change the game once again, it does feel like Nintendo has found a form factor that fits its design philosophy and development culture like a glove. And so, the Switch is likely the new normal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's within that context that I feel the Switch 2 needs to be evaluated: as what it is rather than what it isn't.

Last year's hit multiplayer game was lauded for lots of reasons, but not least because of its strategems mechanic--demanding you input a complex series of button presses in the heat of combat. Pragmata, the third-person single-player shooter from Capcom, probably wasn't directly inspired by that game, but they represent similar approaches. Central to Pragmata's combat is the ability to hack your robotic opponents to make them vulnerable to attack, which in practice means frantically inputting buttons while androids bear down on you. It's a neat hook, and one that feels distinct from Helldivers' take thanks to its own puzzle format.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Hacking requires navigating across a square grid--at least, every one I saw was square--with the controller's face buttons representing the cardinal directions to move toward the goal.
