The result is not a reply, it\u2019s a reconfiguraion of internal flow logic. Curious to hear if anyone else has explored symbolic-level mutation rather than text-based generation.

Most users of AI are somewhat proficient in prompts especially they know what they want in the respective fields. </p> <p>So I think, at this point, prompt enginu as a stand alone job is obsolete. Yes all need to understand the basics of propmting. </p> <p>But domain knowledge and command of language is now enough and I don&#39;t think a seperate prompt engineer is needed. That is why prompt engineering is mostly a requirement in a job description rather than the main job title. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thoughtpicker\"> /u/Thoughtpicker </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l9aw8z/is_prompt_engineering_now_a_real_job/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l9aw8z/is_prompt_engineering_now_a_real_job/\">[comments]</a><",
