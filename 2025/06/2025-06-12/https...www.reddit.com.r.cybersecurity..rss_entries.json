Not enough analysts for a sturdy rotation and not enough &quot;day people&quot; to babysit clients and manage all the tasks that come with running the SOC, so we end having to put all but a couple people on rotation, which makes for irregular handling and follow up of affairs with clients, backlog of tasks etc. This gets even shittier with all the technos we have to manage (like 8 different siem/edr/email protection and what not tools).
