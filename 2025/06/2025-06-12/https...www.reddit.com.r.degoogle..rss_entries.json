I wanted to share this in-progress project, developping a native Linux phone that accomodated the RK3588S, a highly capable SoC (see <a href=\"/r/dawndrumsdev\">r/dawndrumsdev</a>). I have been looking at solutions to escape the proprietary smartphones and I have used some &quot;degoogled&quot; phones. With recent AOSP news and also grapheneOS, it became harder for me as a user to fight for my private life. A Linux phone that runs a free software and open-source feels the right way for me. The problem was that previous Linux phones had such a performance gap and made it difficult for the user to use the device. With the RK3588, there is potential and I see that Divine D. could be the leap of faith. The devs there seem to share the same vision and they focus on what&#39;s really meaningful for the user experience. Let&#39;s help push it with them because I think it&#39;s time. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
