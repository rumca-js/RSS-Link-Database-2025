        "description": "New Hubble Space Telescope observations have upended decades of expectations about Uranus\u2019 moons. Scientists once thought the planet\u2019s magnetic field darkened their backsides with radiation, but the latest data shows Titania and Oberon are collecting space dust on their leading sides instead. This \u201ccosmic bug splatter\u201d effect suggests dust from Uranus\u2019 outer moons is drifting inward, covering the moons like a slow space car wash. It\u2019s a surprising discovery that sheds light on the strange and dusty dynamics of the Uranian system.",
