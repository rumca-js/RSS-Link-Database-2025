There\u2019s option to swap between first and third person perspective, but that\u2019s not the only new POV. Grace Ashcroft is a new protagonist, and despite rumors that Leon Kennedy would make his return, there\u2019s no sign of him quite yet, but that could always change. We also discuss the demo\u2019s hospital like setting, a big creepy new monster that\u2019s chasing Grace around, and a few other details.\n***\nFor thousands of years (or at least since the 90s) PlayStation has been pushing the boundaries of the video game medium.

Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe Alters is a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study of one man who meets the effects of the formative choices he\u2019s made throughout his life face to face. Managing Jan\u2019s relationships with his alternate selves while extracting enough resources from a hostile alien environment to survive is a balancing act on top of a balancing act, and it cleverly builds up the pressure over the course of its story. Exploration of these barren but eye-catching maps presents a series of puzzles and threats without resorting to blasting aliens, and the conversations and moral dilemmas that arise from Jan\u2019s clones are a novel way to approach a game like this. It\u2019s clearly not a big-budget game with resources to throw at cinematics and character models, but it does a lot with a little to tell its story effectively, and its occasional interface quirks don\u2019t get in the way of that.",

The first brand-new Mario Kart in a decade makes huge changes to the established formula, but ironically, the best parts about it closely follow the blueprint of every entry that\u2019s come before: unbeatable local multiplayer racing on well-designed tracks that more than live up to the series\u2019 legacy. World\u2019s tight controls, celebratory soundtrack, and universal polish marvelously complement the action, and I can\u2019t wait to see how top players will take full advantage of its exciting parkour mechanics in the months and years ahead. The way Nintendo built 30 courses into an interconnected series of highways is undeniably impressive, too, but Mario Kart\u2019s first attempt at an open world is also fairly uneven across its variety of modes. The clear standout among the new ways to play is Knockout Tour, a thrilling battle ",
