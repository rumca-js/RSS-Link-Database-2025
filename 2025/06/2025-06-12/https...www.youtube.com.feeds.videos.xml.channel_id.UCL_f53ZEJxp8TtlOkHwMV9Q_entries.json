        "description": "Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris explore the breakdown of institutions in the digital age, and how difficult it\u2019s become to identify what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. Harris voices deep concern over the role independent media and social platforms play in amplifying misinformation, especially post-October 7th. They discuss the addictive, fragmenting nature of platforms like X, the erosion of trust in institutions, the dangers of AI-generated identity theft \u2014 and possible solutions. The result is a sobering analysis of epistemic collapse, digital psychopathy, and the urgent need for institutional structure in a world where mass information fails us.\n\nThis episode was filmed on June 6th, 2025.\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
