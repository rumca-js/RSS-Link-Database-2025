But in software, the company has been largely absent where PCs are concerned. That\u2019s changing, AMD executives say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD\u2019s Advancing AI event Thursday focused on enterprise-class GPUs like its Instinct lineup. But it\u2019s a software platform you may not have heard of, called ROCm, that AMD depends upon just as much. AMD is releasing ROCm 7 today, which the company says can boost AI inferencing by three times through the software alone. And it\u2019s <em>finally</em> coming to Windows to battle Nvidia\u2019s ",

The new Duo Link V3 design combines impressive speed and dual USB-A and USB-C connections with a fairly low price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection, PNY claims that the Duo Link V3 reaches read speeds of up to 1,000 MB/s and write speeds of up to 800 MB/s, assuming you\u2019re connected to a compatible port. That\u2019s fast enough to transfer 100 gigabytes of data in about two minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s technically an OTG drive, making it compatible with most phones and tablets in addition to the usual PCs and laptops (and just about everything else these days).
