They keep saying that people\nsay Apple is behind in AI <em>because it doesn\u2019t have its own\nchatbot</em>. To me, Apple has been clear that it has a different\nstrategy, and I think that strategy mostly makes sense. I have\nnever heard someone wish for an Apple chatbot. The issue is that\neveryone can see that Apple seems behind in <em>executing</em> said\nstrategy, both that features didn\u2019t ship on time and that the ones\nthat did ship don\u2019t measure up to similar features from other\ncompanies.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, they seem to be trying to <a href=\"https://mas.to/@osullivan/114662053414638681\">debunk</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino\">John Gruber\u2019s\nclaim</a>",
