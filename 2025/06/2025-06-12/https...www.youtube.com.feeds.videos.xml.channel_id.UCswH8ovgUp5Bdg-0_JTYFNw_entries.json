I dive into the sudden narrative shift\u2014why are people like Cash Patel and Dan Bongino now insisting Epstein killed himself after previously questioning everything? I explore how power transforms people, how media and government work to bury truth, and why names like Gates and Clinton keep surfacing. From Bill Hicks\u2019 infamous joke to Brett Weinstein\u2019s recent post, this episode is about the questions they don\u2019t want us asking\u2014and what it says about the world we're living in.\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscription\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday - Thursday on Rumble: https://bit.ly/russellbrand-rumble\n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",
