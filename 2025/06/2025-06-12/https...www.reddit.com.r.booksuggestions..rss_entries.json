I\u2019ve re read it at least a dozen times and, as much as i love it, I\u2019d also love to find some other books that are similar to it to enjoy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve looked through the author\u2019s other works and nothing seems to quite resonate with me the same as this one does. I know I won\u2019t find a book that has the exact same plot or emotion connected to it- but if anyone has any suggestions for something they think may complement it, I\u2019d love to hear them!</p> <p>If it helps, what I love in particular about this story is how much I resonate with the MC. Charlotte doesn\u2019t even know she longs for the freedom seafaring gives her until she\u2019s already gone through it. I love her subversion of roles, both in class and gender. And I find her to be a charming narrator throughout.</p> <p>Anyways, please don\u2019t hesitate to recommend anything! Thanks :3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",

Throughout the book the main character is forced to look into the mirror and take an honest look at themselves. Their soul is turned inside out and every part of themself is laid bare. The journey towards self discovery is like plunging into deep, black waters.

(Biology is my favorite but all branches are good) </p> <p>I am trying to get back into reading and the last few books I really blew through were STEM romance books. I loved the mixture of academic culture and a cute love story. I have read all of the Ali Hazelwoods STEM romance books (The Love Hypothesis, Love on the Brain, etc), and although I loved them, I think she is beginning to faster and less quality books due to pressure from her publishing company. I did not like her recent biotech book, Not In Love, and especially didn\u2019t care for the knotting in Bride. Smut is fine but mostly I am in it for a cute love story. I just started The Kiss Quotient, which has been alright, just really really heavy on the smut, which can be kinda a lot and I don\u2019t really want to read in public.

I just found out about the existence of this subreddit after scrolling and scrolling\u2026and more scrolling through the depths of the internet while searching for a new book to read. Quite a simple task - I thought - and yet it proves more difficult. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here and hope you can give me some suggestions?</p> <p>I absolutely LOVE \u201eThe Hobbit\u201c and \u201eLord of the Rings\u201c (&amp; read it in 3 languages...yep), however I just can\u2019t get into other works of Tolkien. I tried, it just doesn&#39;t spark my interest in the same way. In general I\u2019m not really fond of fantasy, no matter if it&#39;s a book or a movie/series. Somehow surprising given the fact that my favorite blanket got the map of middle earth printed on it\u2026 Anyways, back to the books. I\u2019m a big basketball fan and read a lot of biographies (DeRozan, Iguodala, James, Doncic,\u2026 - you name it), also from other athletes from different disciplines. I can\u2019t handle horror stuff or anything",

I really enjoyed Convenience Store Woman and The Kiss Quotient. </p> <p>I find that when I search up \u201cbooks with weird girls\u201d I\u2019m mostly suggested girls that are obsessive, or cannibals, stalkers etc, they all have pretty dark themes. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for anything lighter? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/peanutismybabygirl\"> /u/peanutismybabygirl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l98fa4/books_about_weird_girls_that_arent_creepy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l98fa4/books_about_weird_girls_that_arent_creepy/\">[comments]</a></span>",
