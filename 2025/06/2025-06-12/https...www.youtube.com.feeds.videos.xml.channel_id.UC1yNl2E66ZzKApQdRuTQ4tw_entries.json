Get your first 30 days free as well as 20% off an annual premium subscription when you use my link \u279c https://brilliant.org/sabine.\n\nIn a stunning new paper, a pair of physicists argue that space could be made up of qubits, the building blocks of quantum computers, giving support to Wheeler\u2019s \u201cIt from Qubit\u201d idea according to which everything is ultimately qubits. Does this mean that the universe might be a quantum computer? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13293\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join this channel to get access to perks \u279c",
