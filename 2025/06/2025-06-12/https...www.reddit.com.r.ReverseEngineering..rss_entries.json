Tool panels can also now be docked on any edge of the window or detached to a floating window (except when using the Wayland display manager under Linux).</p> <p>For Windows users, there is now an installer which will install the editor and add an association for all file types, so that it will appear in any file&#39;s &quot;Open With&quot; menu. The standalone .zip releases will continue to be provided too.</p> <p>For macOS users, the application is now a dual-architecture executable for Apple Silicon ",
