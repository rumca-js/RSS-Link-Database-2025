And while we are never, and I mean NEVER, here to fat shame, someone should really give Amy Klobuchar that message. </p><p>Klobuchar posted a video of a mom claiming she\u2019s been struggling to make ends meet and has relied on SNAP benefits for what\u2019s implied to be up to 21 years.

However, there were a few drag queens preying on Donald Trump last night at the Kennedy Center. A couple of dudes were going to be at the same performance of <em>Les Mis\u00e9rables</em>, so they decided to dress in women's clothing because they...thought it would trigger Donald Trump? Or at the very least trigger JD Vance? </p><p>If I'm being straight with you (no pun intended), I haven't had the bandwidth to pay attention to any of the Kennedy Center drama.

Removing David from said leadership position for no other reason than he's both a male and identifies as one. Yes, in a vote conducted by a group of party elitists, Hogg's election as vice chair has been nullified. Side note, a poll circulating on X yesterday gave Democrats an approval rating of only 21%.</p><p>To set the stage for what happened, listen to this cisegendered white man calling Democrats a threat to Democracy:</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"",
