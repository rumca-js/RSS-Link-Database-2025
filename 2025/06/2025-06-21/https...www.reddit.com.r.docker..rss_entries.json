I have a nodejs api server and an angular frontend. I want to run e2e tests in azure-pipelines and for that I need to run the api, the frontend and the postgres database on the agent. I found that it may be solved with docker compose and docker in general. Do you know and resources that tackle this specific scenario outside the official docs?
