I am overwhelmed reading instructions, I need visuals and playthrough too. I do have ppl I can play with, but I will be the teacher. I also joined BGA, but I don&#39;t want to make a fool of myself going in unprepared.</p> <p>I am genuinely curious how some of you learn these games. What is your best method? Props if you can open up the instructions and game-on, but for the people that need the visuals/playthrough, how do you do it when you are alone?</p> <p>I&#39;ve been watching YouTube playthrough videos, if you have any suggestions on a channel that does excellent playthrough, please share.</p> <p>Note: I will be doing the Spirit Island App, to learn that doozie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Length1646\"> /u/N",

The game went out quite good, though they were expecting a game with more \u201cgame\u201d to it, instead of a (mostly) interaction/role play kind of game. When studying the rules (and, after, explaining to the other 4 players) i recognized that the sheriff, if opened someone\u2019s bag, would receive a fine for any illegal, or legal, item that wasn\u2019t \u201cdeclared\u201d by the player, and \u201cvice-versa\u201d if they were telling the truth, but this time the sheriff was the one who would pay. But one thing stayed on my mind during the play, i\u2019ve thought that the money would \u201cflow\u201d more between the players and i thought that MAYBE it might be in the rulebook that the sheriff should pay the penalty for the items that were true in the bag. For example: Let\u2019s say i declared 4 chickens to the sheriff. He opens the bag and there\u2019s 3 chickens and 1 crossbow. I would have to pay a fine for the crossbow and have it \u201cconfiscated",

The rule in itself I got, but when will I be able to attack a player&#39;s foreing colony? What I didn&#39;t get is when will I be able to place a ship on my planet that happens to be a foreing colony for a different player? Piling up on that, If I draw blue, can I attack a blue planet that was already colonized by another player?</p> <p>Receive the game on Wednesday and I&#39;m translating it into portuguese to play on Sunday.</p> <p>Thanks in advance to everyone \ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-Reflection8040\"> /u/Icy-Reflection8040 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lgjmu9/cosmic_encounter_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lgjmu9/cosmic_encounter_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",
