But I\u2019m curious which hypervisor hardening methods are actually effective and how you know when enough is enough. Also, is enforcing runtime integrity a good idea?</p> <p>I understand that installing security tools directly on ESXi is uncommon and can void support contracts unless they\u2019re VMware-certified. Still, ESXi on its own offers very limited visibility and protection.</p> <p>Lately, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot from Vali Cyber. They have what I believe is the only VMware-certified runtime security agent for ESXi.</p> <p>But wouldn\u2019t adding an agent just expand the hypervisor attack surface or impact performance?

When I ask to see what it is, it\u2019s a bunch of benign windows services like svchost or Edge for example.</p> <p>We got Defender XDR and no alerts, or telemetry that points to a system compromise. Like, the guy texts me with the most bizarre ideas of why he thinks it\u2019s compromised. Like, have you dealt with any of this?

We&#39;re also tasked with bringing order while we ourselves are suffering the effects of said <del>burnout</del> chaos.</p> <p>How often are we running from fire to fire to fire, without any ability to step away and ask why there are so many fires or how we can address the root causes that started the fires in the first place? We can&#39;t. It&#39;s chaos.</p> <p>While I was sitting through yet another Friday marathon of meetings with no agendas, vague subject lines, and that ultimately should&#39;ve been (at best) an email, I started searching to see if there was some sort of principle or shorthand name around addressing chaos while you&#39;re in the midst of it yourself. I found a few adjacent principles like the Deadline Doom Loop, but not exact matches. </p",
