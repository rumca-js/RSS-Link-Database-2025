I feel it&#39;s a severely underrated book, but if I was asked, I&#39;m not exactly sure why I&#39;d recommend it. It feels like a book where the protagonist isn&#39;t being served by the story- they aren&#39;t editorialised to make them more lovable, there aren&#39;t real moments of high drama and tension, it&#39;s just a meandering series of unfortunate events showing how this one person, through no fault of her own, is railroaded from her literal childhood into a life of hardship and misery. Everything is told in this cold, clinically detached way that probably didn&#39;t endear the book to readers, but I feel communicates the MC&#39;s cold detachment from her own life at crucial moments. Donoghue went on to tremendous success later on with Room and The Pull of the Stars, and I&#39;ve only ever met one other hum",
