I know a lot of people complain about bad Nvidia support for Linux, it has always worked really well for me with everything. Between Lutris and Steam, I have been able to get a pretty wide range of video games to run pretty smoothly. I should mention, though, that I have made it a point to use Flatpak as much as possible.

My laptop just don&#39;t have a Ethernet port and I don&#39;t have my USB to Ethernet adapter with me. Question now is if the driver will be installed in the USB stick distro and will work on any laptop or do I have to specifically download the correct driver?

I\u2019m not a kernel hacker, just someone running Linux on older hardware and exploring ways to make it run better.</p> <p>I came across the BFQ I/O scheduler (Budget Fair Queueing), which is designed to make disk access fairer between programs. It\u2019s not the default on most distros, but it can be enabled manually. On my system, switching to BFQ made the laptop feel less sluggish when apps were opening or background updates were running. It didn\u2019t increase performance in benchmarks, but it reduced those small freezes or stutters during multitasking.</p> <p>To check if BFQ is supported on your disk, run:</p> <p>cat /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler</p> <p>Replace sdX with your actual device (like sda or mmcblk0). If you see \u201cbfq\u201d in the list, you can try switching to it like this:</p> <p>echo bfq | sudo tee /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler</p> <p>This change ",

I take a lot of notes with a lot of attachments, but 5gb should be a safe and future-proof limit.</li> <li>Cross-device sync. A workaround is ok as long as it is smooth and simple, as I switch between phone and pc notes frequently, many times within minutes of each other. .</li> <li>Free drawing anywhere on the page (preferred, but at least some drawing support is necessary).</li> <li>Code markdown preferred.
