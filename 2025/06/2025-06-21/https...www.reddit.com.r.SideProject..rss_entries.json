But what about when they stop using the product way before that?</p> <p>I kept asking myself: \u2022 How do I know when a user is slipping away silently? \u2022 Can I catch that moment early enough to re-engage them? \u2022 What would it look like to automate that process for lean teams?</p> <p>So I\u2019ve been building something to help solve that. Not a bloated CS tool \u2014 just a lightweight script and insights for solo founders to know when users stop seeing value.</p> <p>Would love to hear how you currently handle this as a small team or solo dev. What\u2019s working? What\u2019s broken? If it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll drop a link to what I\u2019m building in the comments for feedback.</p> <p>Thanks for reading \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kwesi_dev\">",

Great for browsing, tough for actually learning and retaining information.</p> <p>**My solution:** Transforms any Wikipedia article into:</p> <p>- Summaries at different difficulty levels</p> <p>- Visual mind maps </p> <p>- Practice quizzes with explanations</p> <p>- Flashcards for spaced repetition</p> <p>- Audio podcasts for passive learning</p> <p>Been working on this because I found myself bookmarking tons of Wikipedia articles but never actually studying them properly.</p> <p>Launching with generous free limits this week to get feedback.

I thought the hardest part was making the product. I didn\u2019t know that reaching to my target customers is another level. It\u2019s already been a month, but still navigating online sales through my website and social media marketing. I\u2019ve reached out to some micro influencers in the area with no luck. Is there any advice that I can get from the group? I feel like I created value for my customers but they are harder to find than I thought.

Instead, it would track your mental and physical state and adapt your schedule based on how you&#39;re actually feeling. If you&#39;re low-energy or stressed, it might suggest lighter or restorative tasks instead of pushing you to \u201cgrind through\u201d everything.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m validating the idea and trying to better understand how others experience this problem.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking to talk to people who want to be consistent with their productivity and discipline",
