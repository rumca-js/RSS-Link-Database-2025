I went to college for computer science and I might be hesitant to learn programming today if I had to relearn. My rational being that AI could get better at a rate that is faster than a human can get better at coding. If you were to commit to getting a degree centered around programming, it will take you 4 years and lots of practice to become an avid coder. AI, while not perfect, will continue to improve and given the same 4 years it takes someone to learn programming (get a computer science or related degree) will most likely outperform any human by the end of that time frame.

Essentially, why can&#39;t we just pay for our own MRIs, for example, and take the radiologist report we&#39;ve purchased to get AI to tell us what&#39;s most likely happening with our bodies? Is this the future of medical service? Could this bring the cost of things down? </p> <p>I get that doctors are highly trained and very smart. But ... AI learns and never forgets. There is no going to medical school. There&#39;s no books to read. It can just scan and know the latest and greatest information and retain that information indefinitely. Just curious what you folks think about this idea and what you think the future holds.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SteezyJoeNetwork\"> /u/SteezyJoeNetwork </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.r",

Last week, MIT News announced his solution: a technique that uses AI-generated polymer films to physically restore damaged paintings in hours rather than months. The research appears in Nature.</p> <p>Kachkine&#39;s method works by printing a transparent &quot;mask&quot; containing thousands of precisely color-matched regions that conservators can apply directly to an original artwork. Unlike traditional restoration, which permanently alters the painting, these masks can reportedly be removed whenever needed. So it&#39;s a reversible process that does not permanently change a painting.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/mit-student-prints-ai-polymer-masks-to-restore-paintings-in-hours/\">https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/",

I&#39;ve built a number of nonlinear optimization solvers for physical chemistry problems, and it&#39;s routine to use &quot;damping&quot; while going through iterations. Damping mixes the previous guess with the new guess and helps to smooth out, increasing the likelihood that you get convergence but also making convergence slower, so it&#39;s a tradeoff. Without damping if your problem is strongly nonlinear you end up oscillating because the model can never hit the sweet spot. I&#39;m not specialized in AI so I&#39;m not sure but I think &quot;learning rate&quot; is a similar concept as a hyperparameter.</p> <p>And using AI assistance for programming I just keep running into something similar.
