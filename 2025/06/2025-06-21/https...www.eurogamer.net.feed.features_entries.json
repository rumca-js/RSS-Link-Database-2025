Going into this review, we had many questions: to what extent is a generational leap delivered? What are our general impressions on system performance? What are the characteristics of the hardware form factor and accompanying peripherals? The answers to these questions are generally positive but when it comes to LCD screen quality along with its signature VRR and HDR features - well, unfortunately, the drawbacks of Nintendo's display choices far outweigh the benefits. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digital",

It took me about four hours to pin down what Fantasy Life is, because by turns it's Animal Crossing and then it's a role-playing game, and then it's something else. The form of the game shifts and shimmies during the opening hours as a constant stream of new ideas are introduced, and it's only as they begin to settle that you begin to appreciate what an intoxicating blend it can be.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-might-be-the-star-of-the-switch-2-launch-providing-both-the-animal-crossing-and-rpg-experience-it-needs\">Read more</a></p>",
