See how we keep our studio online with Twingate :https://ntck.co/twingate_ciscolive2025 \n\nI haven\u2019t been back to Cisco Live since 2019. But this year, I brought my entire team. The largest networking conference in the world, 22,000 people all in one place, talking about networking. But this year\u2026felt different. There was a heaviness in the air, all because of one thing: AI.\n\nIn this video, I\u2019m taking you with me to Cisco Live 2025. I\u2019ll show you who I met, and how my experience was different this year. Then, we\u2019re going to rewind, and find out how this conference got started in the first place, and how it\u2019s changed over the years, all the way up to AI: the biggest shift networking has seen in decades.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Join the NetworkChuck Academy!: https://ntck.co/NCAcademy \n\n\n\n**Sponsored by Twingate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NETWORKCHUCK\n---------------------------------------------------\n\u27a1\ufe0fNetworkChuck membership: https://ntck.co/Premium \n\u2615\u2615 COFFEE and MERCH:",
