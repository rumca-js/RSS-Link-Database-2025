Her birthday is coming up and I thought maybe we could get her the merlin missions ones next but I anticipate her going through those just as quickly. I&#39;d like some older good books for her to read but I also don&#39;t know what would be too advanced (this kid does stay up late reading her Bible so she&#39;s a bit advanced). Is the Nancy drew series too advance? What about Anne of green gables? Any recommendations? She loves princesses also, pretty sure she&#39;s convinced she&#39;s a princess in another life lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Different-Mood-5643\"> /u/Different-Mood-5643 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lh9uvk/6_year_old_turning_7/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lh9uvk/6_",

I plan on reading the novel \u201cTrainspotting\u201d because I loved the movie so much, and i want to keep the ball rolling. Are there other books that fit that sort of classic, emotional, profound theme that I might be invested in? I think my issue has just been no motivation to read and finding things a bit slow, but I want to read the real classics and interesting books that really make you feel like a part of the story.

The guys can always manipulate them in doing whatever they want and any sexual activity they want even for a silly excuse. </p> <p>I like my fmcs to have a little character. She should not fall for the guy in a single look and can totally shut up his advances.

Any and all genres welcome- sci-fi, heist, noire, who-dunnits, etc. I&#39;ve listened to all the Andy Weir I can find, the DiVinci Code, some Michael Criton, I love Sherlock Holmes and fun &quot;cozy mystery&quot; type stuff, have had fun reading John Grisham in highschool but haven&#39;t read him since but very open to that kind of thing, even Ready Player One (not my fave but did keep me engaged). I tried the Wheels of times -which I really am enjoying but not dynamic enough, but I love fantasy and am open to YA since it moves faster (HP is the example I can think of) if that helps with suggestion ideas.

I&#39;ve always equated the conservatism around me to a lack of access to education, Christianity, and higher poverty rates (perhaps unfairly, obviously, there are a lot of rich conservatives), but I realized I&#39;ve never really read up on it. Does anyone have any good books about how conservatism became so prominent in the South? </p> <p>Also, one thing that always frustrates me is the lack of acknowledgement around how common conservatism is in other parts of the world. The NW is painted as a very liberal place, but when I traveled around that region, it was very obvious to me that rural areas in this part of the states operated with the same biases I see in my own state. Any good books about southern or red neck stereotypes and how they came to be? </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste_Ad7047\"> /u/Waste_Ad7047 </a> <br/> <sp",
