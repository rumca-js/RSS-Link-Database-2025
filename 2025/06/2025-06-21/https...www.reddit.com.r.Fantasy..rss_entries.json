I have recently been on a reading kick for the first time in YEARS and for some reason it\u2019s fantasy adventure/war that\u2019s got me interested (not for some reason it\u2019s a BANGER of a niche). I recently read Poppy Wars, Red Rising, and the Keeper Chronicles and was wondering if there were any more suggestions:</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for like a more coming of age through fantasy war/adventure rather than a ton of romance (though I won\u2019t turn that down lol)! Also if possible I love an ensemble series w lots of lovable (and hate-able) characters and more\u2026 adult romance rather than YA (but again I\u2019ll hear you out there are many YA books that I love)!</p> <p>I\u2019m about to read Scythe by Shusterman and reread Airman by Eoin Colfer!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Toastymallowdragon\"> /u/Toastymallowdragon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lh9sfd/looking_for_some_books/\">[",

Writing a book is difficult and takes a lot of work and I don\u2019t want to discount that. </p> <p>But holy fucking hell. There are so many respected booktokers and YouTubers and reviewers saying this is a fast-paced, witty, Grimdark, well-written fantasy. ITS LITERALLY NONE OF THOSE THINGS. NOT ONE SINGLE THING IS TRUE. Welcome to my TED Talk. Evidence below. </p> <p>Let\u2019s start with fast-paced. IT IS NOT FAST PACED. Fast-paced means that the characters are constantly making decisions to move the plot along QUICKLY. Red Rising is fast paced because Darrow is CONSTANTLY making decisions that move the plot and his journey forward. Anji, quite literally from the first moment of the book, makes hardly a single decision for herself. I\u2019d argue that this was one of the SLOWEST PACED books I\u2019ve ever read. Because for 90% of the book, nothing happens! She\u2019s so passive, so unint",

Now I&#39;m in a endless search of stories like that in Royal Road or webnovels. I&#39;ve been reading Spell Weaver that starts really good but it insists on focusing on relationships or characters. I have also been reading Lone Wanderer, it&#39;s a western cultivation story, I don&#39;t like cultivation story, but the magic is so extensive and the protagonist learns by leaps and bounds by finding shortcuts and being hardworking. </p> <p>It would be lovely and really appreciated if any of you recommended a story like that to me. More than one would be awesome too. Thanks in advance.

The only books I read for myself were strong rulebooks and study ones. But I just didn&#39;t find books I like. Now I&#39;m looking for fantasy, I tried GoT and it&#39;s obviously not starters friendly, and also Percy Jackson, it was easy to read but also for younger audiences. I started reading a mystery one, no fantasy, and it was nice but I dropped because I lost interest. But what I liked in it was how fast paced, dynamic but also easy to digest it was. Also it was a very short book. So I&#39;m looking for something like that in fantasy. Would be a plus if it was a mystery one or felt like a ttrpg table turned book (like vox machina but less theatrical).</p> <p>Ps: I&#39;m from Brazil, so the recommendations might not be localized :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ma_Deus\"> /u/Ma_Deus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.",

Boy, was I wrong! Lies of Locke Lamora is an absolute masterpiece having all the ingredients for a charming , beautiful read. The book started off as a funny heist fantasy about Locke, his notorious gang going about with their fun adventures in the City of Camorr and then suddenly it became deep , dark and bloody. The cussing in this book is on a different level all together, the book kept me hooked and kept me guessing at the end of every chapter, character work is so good that you may like Jean more than Locke or you may feel bad for the Grey king. Highly recommended!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ComfortableTeach8959\"> /u/Comfortable",

I grew up loving Into the Woods, I binged Once Upon a Time in college. Retellings are wonderful too, but there&#39;s something special about taking the idea of storytelling, throwing a bunch discrete tales in a blender, and seeing what new comes out of it. How to Survive This Fairytale made me laugh, made me cry, and made me cry some more. I&#39;m usually not a super emotional person, but this book got to me in a really profound way. Hallow has ",
