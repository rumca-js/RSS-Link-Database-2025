Otherwise smooth ride all around and booted to windows only to do music composing, recording and mixing.</p> <p>Week ago I decided to try cachyOS. Installation was super smooth and I didn&#39;t need to reinstall my games which was super convinient. Very soon after I saw first weird bugs that have become more problematic. Even though I&#39;ve correct boot order set in the bios I cannot boot into OS about half the time. It tries to load it but after minute or two reboots the system and then I get in just fine.

To name just 2: Deadly Premonition and Akibas Trip Undead &amp; Undressed. And yeah partial reason are Multiplayer games I simply can\u2019t play anything with my friends because everything that they play won\u2019t work on Linux like Rainbow Six Siege. Then there is also the occasional fear of getting one day suddenly banned from some game because they had a bad day and decided to ban Linux users. And I don\u2019t want my account to get banned in which I have invested tons of hours and also a bit of money like Genshin Impact or Honkai and so on. And I\u2019m also tired of fiddling around at all I wanna press play and be done with it and not swap around Proton versions because one doesn\u2019t have FMVs or whatever. ",
