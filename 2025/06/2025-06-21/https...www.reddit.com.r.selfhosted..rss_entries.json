Thought you might find it useful!<br/> <strong>Why I built this:</strong><br/> Got tired of watching hour-long YouTube videos when I just needed the key points. Even 10-minute videos are often packed with fluff and could be summarized in 2 minutes. Now I can quickly get AI summaries of educational content, conference talks, and tutorials. The audio feature is great for &quot;reading&quot; summaries while doing other tasks.<br/> <strong>What it does:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Generates AI-powered summaries of YouTube videos and entire playlists</p></li> <li><p>Converts summaries to audio using Google&#39;s Text-to-Speech</p></li> <li><p>Smart caching to minimize API usage and speed up repeat requests</p></li> <li><p>Clean web interface accessible from any device on your network</p></li> </ul> <p><strong",

Looking for implementation/software/stack recommendations. My instinct is to </p> <ol> <li>Avoid the NAT bullshit standard to the container world and assign an IP block/pool to each host.</li> <li>Aggressively stick to pure L3.</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;ve been rebuilding my home setup, going from &quot;<del>madman&#39;s playground</del>&quot; <em>homelab</em> to &quot;okay, what services do I actually want to maintain locally&quot;. One of the included changes is moving to mini-pcs, which are chock full of 2.5gbe NICs, rather than my motley collection of 10/25gbe DAC-based networking. A fully managed switch for 2.5gbe is rather pricey, so I&#39;m tempted to stick with a &quot;dumb&quot; switch for my mini server network and do all my segregation via overlay.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
