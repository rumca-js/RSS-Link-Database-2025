I worked for a single company for 9 of those years. After not being turned down promotions, and needing head count to apply for a &quot;higher level&quot; i decided I was going to jump ship as I was feeling stagnant. </p> <p>In April I found a new job, more pay, better benefits etc. However, today marks my 60 day mark and I hate it here. It&#39;s awful. Since the company is full remote they expect us to be on a zoom bridge for the entirety of our 8 hour days. We can only leave when we have other meetings. Camera must be on all day. To add, they really don&#39;t even take security seriously, and any recommendations I make or do suggestions i&#39;m given a list of reasons why it won&#39;t make sense. </p> <p>So TL;DR new job sucks, is 60 days too soon to start applying for new roles? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",

In some cases, these are doctors, using corporate software (virtualized) including medical software (patient scheduling/notes etc). The permutations of usage, and therefore risk, vary a lot. </p> <p><strong>Background</strong><br/> 24 months ago, we had a major cyber incident. As a result, we&#39;ve completely rebuilt our own systems with better tools, methodologies, analysis etc. With the insight we now have we can, &amp; are, ever improving &amp; increasing resilience. Not to mention the ability to quickly respond to an incident. BYOD, we&#39;re just so blind. </p> <p>My concern isn&#39;t so much our networks, it&#39;s the risk of personal information whether it be patient, customer or staff, getting compromised.</p> <p>Thanks,<br/> T</p> </div><",
