(I\u2019ve tried cozy mysteries and the cats-and-caf\u00e9s genre popular of late, and the writing seems pretty weak.) Not a mystery/romance girl either. </p> <p>If it helps: the books I\u2019ve found most emotionally sustaining are Moby-Dick, Bruno Schultz\u2019s oeuvre, the Annihilation tetralogy, Kristi Gunn, Hard-Boiled Wonderland, and various nonfiction on subterranean realms and deep-sea exploration\u2026not a very cohesive basket, I know.</p> <p>Any recs for good cozies?
