I'm sure I could do that now if I really wanted to, but never again will I be in a position to run out onto the playground or field every breaktime and always have enough people for at least some five-a-side. It was glorious. Tennis ball, sopping wet sponge ball, tatty old mini leather ball&hellip; we'd have kicked around a bunch of rolled up paper if we had to. Having played Sloclap's (<a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu\">Sifu</a>, Absolver) Rematch for a few hours it's already provided the closest I've experienced to those classic days of scuffed shoes and grass-stained trousers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-the-challenging-new-on",
