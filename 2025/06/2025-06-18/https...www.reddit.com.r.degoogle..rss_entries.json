Any tips? </p> <p>Thanks! This community has been a huge help for me in my degoogle journey. I have yet to flash a new OS to my phone (tried iode and e/os but neither worked, so I am waiting to get some help on that issue separately) but because of you all my stock android is about as degoogled as I can get it for now.
