Back in March, <a href=\"https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/dickinson-high-to-retire-midgets-mascot-after-nearly-a-century\">the school district announced they\u2019d be retiring the nickname</a>, after nearly a century. Last month <a href=\"https://www.dickinson.k12.nd.us/our-district/news/1810076/a-new-era-students-choose-dickinson-mavericks\">they announced their new name</a>: the Mavericks.
