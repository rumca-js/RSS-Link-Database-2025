I&#39;m just looking for help because this is all very frustrating. I bet I could help alleviate the memory issue by adding a swap file, but it is still bizarre that it&#39;s taking MORE memory on Linux than on Windows.</p> <p>I&#39;m running Overwatch through Steam which I got from flatpak (because someone on a forum somewhere said doing so reduces the issues). I&#39;ve looked on the ProtonDB forum for Overwatch but people with my same issue provide no resolution, or their resolution has been ineffective, or I don&#39;t understand their resolution.</p> <p>Specs (from inxi -Fza)</p> <ul> <li>Kernel: 6.12.28-1-MANJARO<br/></li> <li>Motherboard: ASRock Z270 Pro4<br/></li> <li>CP",

Am I seeing the kind of performance I should expect to see in wow with these specs? Is it possible overclock settings between adrenaline and the bios are conflicting? I&#39;ve",

And generally, it&#39;s best to use a mod manager designed specifically for the game so it can do things like prioritize load orders and enable/disable mods with a click. So, I went to download this mod <a href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/460\">https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/460</a> But when I try to execute, it says &quot;for security reasons, launching executables is not allowed in this context&quot;. This is regardless whether I put said exe in the game&#39;s folder or right on my desktop.</p> <p>Perhaps it&#39;s because it&#39;s designed for Windows, but it sucks not to have a convenient mod manager.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Questioning-Warrior\"> /u/Questioning-Warrior </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

When benchmarking them in Superposition - they are pretty much exactly the same.<br/> However, when gaming the Omnibook Ultra Flip is getting like 1/3 in Cyberpunk 2077 with exactly the same settings (compared to the Omnibook with 375HX). Tested with Company of Heroes 3 and it&#39;s way worse there as well, maybe like 50% of the Omnibook with 375HX.</p> <p>I do think it got something to do with power profiles and power delivery - that Arc 140v gets like no power when the CPU asks for juice. And that is why Superposition (more or less no cpu usage) works decent on 140v but CP 2077 requires a lot of cpu power = horrible performance.

Moving was mostly fine, I did a fresh install then copied my home folder and reinstalled the programs. But for some reason, playing games through steam proton would lag and stutter really hard even though I was hoping the dedicated GPU would make it much smoother. And i know that something was wrong because it actually ran worse than on my old laptop.</p> <p>So I did a bunch of stuff to try and troubleshoot it. My main suspicion was that it kept using my iGPU because it had really high CPU usage and low GPU usage, so i tried adding the environment variable on launch command, changing the NVIDIA PRIME profile to performance mode, updating NVIDIA drivers, using optirun, but it didn&#39;t work (I also wanted to try disabling the iGPU but there was",

I&#39;m trying to get WiVRn to work so I can play VRChat, but it refuses to connect wirelessly, which is a must for me due to the horrible battery life on my headset. It works perfectly fine with a wired connection, so I have no clue why wireless won&#39;t work. Please send help.</p> <p>More info:</p> <p>I&#39;ve opened the correct ports and switched to the &quot;home&quot; zone</p> <p>I checked and Avahi is running fine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MikanHighest\"> /u/MikanHighest </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1le3pqg/wivrn/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1le3pqg/wivrn/\">[comments]</a></span>",
