The novel doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be abject dystopia, but I&#39;m open to positive or negative outlooks.

Growing up i was always very interested in reading but always struggled with picking a book. Now that im trying to start reading again im having the same problem. Some genres ive liked in the past are historical fiction and realistic fiction. Some books ive read and really enjoyed are hunger games and the perks of being a wallflower. I would also be open to nonfiction. I really just love learning about everything,how things work, and history/historical people. I also wouldn\u2019t mind a book that is emotionally traumatizing and impactful. Hopefully this is helpful for suggestions.

Absolutely one of my favorites and first novel I ever finished, most of the times I can&#39;t really finish novels, they&#39;re too long and I get bored/tired, but Nevermoor was really the first novel I ever finished. Words alone can&#39;t describe how it made me feel--whenever I&#39;m in school and sitting alone, or have nothing to do, it really saved me. Especially during boring assemblies or long unneeded speeches in school. Honestly, it&#39;s really underrated, I hope more people come to read it! (I hate gatekeeping, I believe it&#39;s unnecessar",

But she was popular/beautiful/rich and teased him. Then they lost touch for some years and she thinks about him and feels guilty for treating him poorly. Or maybe she understood that he was cute in his own way. Maybe she wants to apologize or make it up for him. And when they meet again fmc sees that he&#39;s glowed up and became a wealthy and successful man. I think it might be something like a second chance story</p> <p>Important points: 1. Mmc&#39;s success <em>is not a reason</em> why fmc wants to reunite with him. She misses the guy she used to know. She might be surprised about the way he&#39;s changed but she doesn&#39;t care about it 2. Mmc is condifent now but deep inside he&#39;s the same sweet guy from the past. He didn&#39;t become an asshole, he isn&#39;t rude to fmc. He still loves",

Obviously I&#39;m not saying that epileptics are psychopaths but these books that I listed really go deep into the brain and explore and explain why psychopathy happened and also provide theories and it&#39;s such an interesting read for me and I&#39;d like a book like this just for epilepsy so I can learn more about myself and epilepsy.</p> <p>Thanks!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Willooooow1\"> /u/Willooooow1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lebam4/is_there_any_books_about_epilepsy_that_anyone_can/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1leba",

However, a lot of fantasy books, especially YA,!tend to be much more serious and dark, and more often than not third person. Does anyone have any suggestions for MG or YA books that sort of have the Percy Jackson feel to them (it doesn\u2019t have to do with dragons but preferably fantasy and if it\u2019s post 2020 that\u2019s even better \ud83d\ude0a) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SlowCollection4183\"> /u/SlowCollection4183 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1le4zcr/needing_a_very_specific_kind_of_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1le4zcr/needing_a_very_specific_kind_of_book/\"",
