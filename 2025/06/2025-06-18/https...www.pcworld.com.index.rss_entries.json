How you deal with it could put you at risk, though. Handling it the \u201cright\u201d way by clicking on an unsubscribe link or button could actually send you to a phishing or otherwise dangerous site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason: For years, the advice was to unsubscribe from email lists\u2014even those you hadn\u2019t signed up for. The thought was that your data got sold to a legitimate business, so they would heed the requests to get off their mailing lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more commonly now, scammers and would-be attackers are using email lists as a way to try to sneak data from you without you knowing. Some may just be verifying that the email address is valid\u2014and if the recipient is willing to interact with spam. A hacker could then build a profile about you, in order to try to successfully scam you through tactics like social engineering.<",
