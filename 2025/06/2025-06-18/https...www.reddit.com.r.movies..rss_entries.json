I binged the whole series over the summer of 2011 and decided to get back to the original.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s because, relative to the other later films, Dr. No is quite simple that it\u2019s aged well. I don\u2019t know how its budget compares to Thunderball and the like, but this is a more standard 60s thriller with Bondisms added on top.</p> <p>Half of the movie feels like a Caribbean detective adventure, and that just fits brilliantly. I do like the campy and more epic later films, but this format works, and I think it\u2019s why Casino Royale is such a strong film too. </p> <p>Obviously it has its \u201cyep, definitely a \u201860s movie\u201d moments, but as a spy thriller from 1962? Holds up pretty damn well. </p> <p>I have no clue why, I remembered this as one of the worst Bond movies.

I saw a lot of critical acclaim for the movie last year, especially for Fernanda Torres&#39; performance, and it&#39;s all very much deserved. Really, you can&#39;t talk about this movie without talking about Torres because she absolutely carries it on her back. It&#39;s one of the best acting performances I&#39;ve seen in the past few years, especially because of how unshowy and restrained it is. It&#39;s all in the gestures, the expressions, the way she&#39;s barely holding it up to try and keep her family together after Rubens&#39; disappearance. Just an absolute clinic in acting craft and technique. </p> <p>But tbh the performances are stellar across the board, especially the girls that play the daughters. It all just comes off as so naturalistic, grounded and real. It often felt like I was watching a documentary of a Brazilian family&#39;s life. </p> <p>It&#39;s ultimately a movie whe",

Loved it, great acting, great story, and actually reminded me of the one time I actually was on a jury and convinced others to acquit because of doubt.</p> <p>The thing that bothers me - they had 11-1 at first, then number 8 says some very unconvincing things about his doubts, then says he\u2019ll change to guilty if nobody else switches. He was lucky the one guy joined him, otherwise the kid would have gotten the chair.</p> <p>Then he brings up all the holes in the evidence, and breaks the others one at a time. Why didn\u2019t he do that before even the first vote? Or at least before agreeing to the second one? Much of the evidence was questionable, and he was clearly prepared to talk about it.</p> <p>Otherwise I loved it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Proper-Ad7371\"> /u/Proper-Ad7371 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1le3rdb/",
