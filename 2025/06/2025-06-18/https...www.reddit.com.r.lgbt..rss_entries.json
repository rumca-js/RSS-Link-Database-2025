Even though he is not LGBT himself, he is removing LGBT members who are on the board. There was a company who discriminated against our local plag for being LGBT during a local pride flag. He decided not to go public about this and silenced anyone who tried to do so.</p> <p>How can I fight against this? What should I do?
