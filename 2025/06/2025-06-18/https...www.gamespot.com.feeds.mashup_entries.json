Nintendo took the wraps off DKB with a rapid-fire presentation detailing its story, features, Amiibo support, and more, and altogether it looks like a dang hoot. Donkey Kong can go Super Saiyajin or turn into a zebra, there's a cabal of evil capitalist Kongs, he collects <em>Bananergy</em>. High marks across the board. The story elements, though, appear to raise some pretty serious questions about our understanding of Donkey Kong lore. That's right, I said \"Donkey Kong lore\" with a straight face. Buckle up, kids.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Donkey Kong Bananza presentation opened with introducing young Pauline, a budding singer who we know from Super Mario Odyssey would go on to be mayor of New Donk City.

Earlier this month, thieves stole nearly 3,000 Nintendo Switch 2 consoles out of a truck without being detected until it was too late.</p><p>A semi-truck driver reported the theft on June 8 at a truck stop in Bennett, Colorado. The driver told police that he discovered the missing Switch 2 boxes while performing a pre-trip inspection. Police determined that 2,810 Switch 2 consoles were taken.</p><p>\"They retail at $499. The cost to Nintendo is just over $410,\" said Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office public information officer Anders Nelson. \"So either way you look at it, it's well over $1 million worth of merchandise stolen.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/someone-pulled-off-a-million-dollar-switch-2-heist/1100-6532522/?f",
