Especially when you have solid blog posts or pages getting traffic, linking from those to weaker or newer pages gives them a serious boost.</p> <p>Also learned it\u2019s way better to drop links contextually in paragraphs, not just in menus or sidebars. Google seems to treat those as more valuable when they\u2019re surrounded by relevant content.</p> <p>Anyway, just throwing that out there in case someone else is stuck chasing external links but hasn\u2019t looked at their internal setup yet.</p> <p>Curious how others here approach internal linking, do you have a system for it or just do it as you go?</p> </di",

I was wondering if anyone has done it for a store with hundreds or thousands of products? I remember reading somewhere that if you already had the products that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to do it but thought I\u2019d check here for some opinions.
