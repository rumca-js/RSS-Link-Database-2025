Is there a single player mode?</p> <p>There is no offline mode. This game will always be more fun with three people. You can matchmake solo, but it is going to be extremely difficult to complete missions like that. Still, every objective and feature has been designed to be achievable alone. Difficulty and objective requirements and rewards will scale with player count.</p> <p>There are no bots or drones.</p> </blo",
