        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, in just a few months in office, President Trump has shown that it is possible to shut down the border and protect our country. Despite what every president in my lifetime has claimed, this is actually a simple problem to solve. Also, we\u2019ll have my instant reaction to the Supreme Court upholding our law in Tennessee banning child gender transition drugs and surgeries. And some Republicans want to sell off federal land, millions of acres of it, to build housing. I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m against the plan. Plus, the Democrat theater kids in Congress are officially out of control. \n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:29 Opening\n01:58 - 19:00 Trump Just Proved The Border Crisis Has A Simple Solution\n20:25 - 28:43 Supreme Court Upholds Tennessee\u2019s Ban On Transgender Drugs For Children\n28:44 - 37:23 Lindsey Graham Wants American Troops On The Ground In Iran\n37:23 - 44:20 Senate Republicans Resurrect Plan To Sell Federal Lands To Build Houses\n44:32 - 53:46 The Comments Section\n5",
