My name is Grayson, I am 14, and am building a scripting language for data manipulation, and other general purposes. At first, I was using the scripting language, which I call Glowscript, for a program I call gVars, which I stopped work on a few days ago. After that, I integrated Glowscript to my program Tardigrade, which is essentially a Glowscript console. I don&#39;t yet have an interpreter or anything too fancy, I just put it in a simple Tkinter script. If you want to check it out, you can! I hope you find it useful! Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Imaginary-Ice1256\"> /u/Imaginary-Ice1256 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1le5e58/tardigrade_a_data_manipulation_tool_with_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",
