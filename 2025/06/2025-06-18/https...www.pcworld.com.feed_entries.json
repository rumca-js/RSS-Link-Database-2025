That\u2019s a 50% discount and matches the lowest price it\u2019s ever been!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a solid outdoor security camera that captures video in 2K resolution, so you can see details in high-def when you review footage or check in remotely to the live feed. At night, the camera continues to capture clear footage with its infrared LEDs and wide aperture. You\u2019ll get alerts when it spots humans, and if you get a <a href=\"https://www",
