This \u201creality threshold\u201d may help explain how imagination can influence perception and sheds light on disorders like schizophrenia. Researchers believe this mechanism could be central to understanding hallucinations and cognitive disruptions in visual processing.",

Researchers say the patterns serve as \"fingerprints\" of fine-scale magnetism, vital for understanding solar eruptions and forecasting space weather. With its 4-meter aperture, DKIST is the world's most powerful solar telescope, unlocking new layers of the Sun\u2019s magnetic complexity.",
