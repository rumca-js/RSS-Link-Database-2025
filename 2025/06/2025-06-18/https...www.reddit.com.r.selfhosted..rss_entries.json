What surprised me the most is that its GUI manager works FLAWLESSLY. Like, HOW. No matter how specific I am with host config in .ssh and how well crafted command I use it just pisses its pants. Am I missing something big here or is that a common experience for you?

I am seeking advice on best practices for doing this securely since the available cameras don&#39;t seem well trusted. </p> <p>I am currently planning on having all cameras on a dedicated VLAN with no internet access nor to other parts of the lab network. I would then create a minimal set of firewall rules needed to get the data from the cameras to the NVR. This allows the NVR to still get updates via internet for example. </p> <p>What I&#39;m concerned about though is that the cameras are still in contact with the NVR (of course, to send data). Is it possible for them to send malicious information via the video stream or some other channel to compromise the NVR and then the rest of the network? I guess running Frigate in a non root Docker container adds a layer of defence. Generally is this quite a low risk in the end? </p> <p>Are there other security issues I should be m",

It doesn&#39;t matter if the new device is just a scanner or a combination device like my Epson (i dont need the printer).</p> <p>The reason why i&#39;m looking for a flatbed and not automatic document feeder is that i have very many different types of documents in their dimensions and they are rarely suitable for automatic feeding, like vaguely A5 documents, receipts, or book-like manuals that are glued or nailed together (e.g. home appliance manuals). So i don&#39;t think i can make use of an ADF.</p> <p>I have more variance in documents and especially many receipts i want to scan but not really a large mass of documents that would benefit from an ADF.</p> <p>That&#39;s why models like Scansnap and other common recommendations don&#39;t seem like the right choice for me.</p> ",

Is this supported by Caddy?</p> <p>Currently I have to switch back and forth to set up a container, which takes several steps before it is up and running. I would prefer to define the Caddy labels (or something) in the docker-compose file for the service I&#39;m creating and then Caddy should pick them up automatically without needing to configure the Caddyfile or restart the containers.</p> <p>Is this possible to do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EN-D3R\"> /u/EN-D3R </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lebe0z/automate_the_onboarding_process_for_containers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/com",
