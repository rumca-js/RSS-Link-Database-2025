For those that don&#39;t know the game, it&#39;s an iteration on the MOBA genre. Team fight (2vs2, 3vs3 etc.) in which you try to either defeat the ennemi heroes of defeat the enemy minions. There&#39;s absolutely no luck at any point. The only random element of the game is the initiative tie breaker that is tossed at the beginning of the game (and then every time you win the initiative tie, you flip the tie breker and the other team gets the initiative advantage foir the next tie).</p> <p>Played around 10 games, almost exclusively 2vs2, why do I find it so good ?</p> <p>1\u00b0 Every game felt different.
