This completely eliminated my client-side request waterfalls.</li> <li>Replacing <code>react-router-dom</code> with the new file-based routing and <code>next/navigation</code> hooks.</li> <li>Using middleware for auth instead of client-side logic. It&#39;s so much cleaner.</li> </ul> <p>I compiled all my notes, code snippets, and a pre-migration checklist into a <strong>full guide to make the process easier</strong> for others. Hope it helps you out!</p> <p><strong>Link:</strong><a href=\"https://beyondit.blog/blogs/CR",

An example of this pattern is a program allocating a very large memory region on the heap and then placing data in the region using normal integers, effectively using them as offsets to refer to the location of data within the large region.</p> <p>While it certainly seems fair that such techniques have the potential to make programs more cache-efficient and space-efficient, and even reduce bugs when done right, I am curious to hear some opinions on whether this pattern could be considered a potential cybersecurity hazard. On the one hand, DOD seems to offer a lot of benefits as a programming paradigm, but I wonder whether there is merit to saying that the extremes of hand-rolled memory management could start to be problematic in the sense that you lose out on both the hardware-leve",
