        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nIn today's Donkey Kong Bananza-centric Nintendo Direct, the company has confirmed that Pauline is indeed in the game, and is playable via a two-player co-op mode. Interestingly, this is a younger version of Pauline than we've seen in 2017's Super Mario Odyssey (where she sang her now-famous \"Jump Up, Superstar\" as Mayor of New Donk City), or even her first appearance in the original Donkey Kong back in 1981. So does that make Bananza a prequel? Other details dropped in the Direct include returning Donkey Kong Country characters, DK's new powers, and more. In other news, Bungie's Marathon has been delayed again, this time to an unspecified date. Bungie is taking feedback from April's test to heart, while publisher Sony is eager to not make the same mistakes Concord did, which died a quick death within two weeks of its launch. And finally, Civil War director and 28 Years Later writer Alex Garland is on his seventh playthrough of FromSoftware's Elden Ring. Speaking ",

There\u2019s still plenty for Awakening to work on though, as its combat never really hits its stride, the endgame is a bit of a chaotic mess not worth the effort, and there\u2019s quite a few technical bugs yet to be squashed, but even these rough patches felt like tiny desert mice next to the leviathan shai-huluds that are this survival game\u2019s wonderful successes.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #DuneAwakening",
