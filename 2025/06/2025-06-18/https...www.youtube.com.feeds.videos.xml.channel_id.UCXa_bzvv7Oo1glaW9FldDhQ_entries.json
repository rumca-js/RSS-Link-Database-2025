Or is it a double-edged sword, one that could lead to a content soul and neverending nightmares in equal measure? For Die-Hardman, it's everything \u2013 the weight of his guilt, his reason for going on, and a prime example of how it can effectively transform a man.

        "description": "The countdown continues for Kojima Productions' Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, a sequel to the unorthodox but acclaimed 2019 action-adventure title. Sam Porter Bridges has returned, but the world is still as hazardous as ever. Whether it's surviving earthquakes, flash floods, Beached Things or the return of Higgs, players will be busier than ever.\n\nAnd to that effect, the sequel has much to offer. A new character named Neil, who Sam will venture to another world to meet and fight on more than one occasion. New threats in the form of the Armed Survivalists. A new continent, Australia, to explore and connect while dealing with its many challenges. That's not even factoring in all the new tools, quality-of-life changes, gameplay improvements, and improved pacing.\n\nOf course, given director Hideo Kojima's reputation, there are likely other surprises to look forward to. Check 15 new things you should know about Death Stranding 2: On the Beach before its launch on June 26th on PS5.",
