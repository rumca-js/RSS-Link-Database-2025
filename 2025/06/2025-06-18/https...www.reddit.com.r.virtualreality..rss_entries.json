I am thinking about purchasing a VR setup maybe because my long time boyfriend is moving away to Canada for grad school and I want to keep things fun by playing games like vr chat with him and I thought a full on vr setup would be freakin awesome to communicate body language as well as just make the experience more fun overall! Plus I can also play other really awesome games on vr! So!! I am a total beginner, I just got my very first PC about a month ago so I am super new to all this techy stuff! I want something that won\u2019t totally break the bank, motion captures my body (maybe just like my head and arms?? Legs? Idk!) but also something that works well! Thank you in advance for any advice! And also, for my purpose of long distance connection and playing other games is it worth it to get a whole setup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Living_Obligation_66\"> /u/Living_Obligation_66 </a> <br/> ",

Strictly a multiplayer game (ideally two competing players).</p> <p>If youve ever played the overwatch community game mode &quot;Genji Dodgeball&quot;, its alot like that. One ball spawns and flies at a player, and they must deflect it with an ingame bat to make it fly towards their opponent</p> <p>If you swing the bat a certain way, you can add a curve to the ball</p> <p>Failure to block the ball results in one round loss, and one point gained by their opposition</p> <p>To prevent rounds from lasting forever, the ball builds speed. Eventually the two players will seem like they&#39;re two Jedi blocking blaster fire</p> <p>If any devs want to give this a shot, let me know and i&#39;ll help with testing and feedback</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stunning_Astronaut_5\"> /u/Stunning_Astronaut_5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/commen",
