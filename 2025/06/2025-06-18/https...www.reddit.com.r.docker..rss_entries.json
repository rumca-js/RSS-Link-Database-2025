Docker is reporting that my container is using 475MB of memory. Docker is set to not use more then 6GB of memory. </p> <p>Restarting the docker application resolves the issues for a few days, but then it comes again. Having a macbook pro m4 with 48GB of memory, this isn&#39;t really an issue. But I am soon to switch jobs, where I will be &quot;degraded&quot; to 24GB of memory, and I would like to still be able to have the container running on my new computer without having to restart the docker container every now and then. Is there any way on running docker without having theese issues? I feel like I already have tried the most. Had resource saver both on and off. Increased swap to maximum 4GB and updated both my mac, docker and container image. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
