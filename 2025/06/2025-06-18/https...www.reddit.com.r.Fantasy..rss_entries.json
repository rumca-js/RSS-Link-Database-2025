I did indeed read all three books in this series? Why? How? I genuinely have no clue but here are my thoughts:</p> <p>Did the editor quit? Some of the sentences did not even make sense even when I re-read them multiple times. There was one sentence where she used the word \u201cyucked\u201d as in \u201cI saved him from yucking his pants in the mud\u201d. Like that is something a four year old would say. </p> <p>I genuinely had no idea who the majority of the characters were because there were so many and sometimes they were referred to by their first name, sometimes by their last name, and sometimes by who their dragon was. But honestly it didn\u2019t even matter because none of the other characters mattered or were even remotely developed. </p> <p>Also the world building was atrocious.

I read Fourth Wing as well, and while it was fun, I thought the world building, characters, plot, romance, etc. was NOT good lol. My expectations were very high going in due to all the high praise and because I absolutely love dragons but it totally fell flat for me. Wasn&#39;t enough dragons, in my opinion. Both of these books drew me in due to them being centered around bonding with dragons/wolves. I&#39;ve heard of the Dragonriders of Pern but have also heard some very questionable things about it dealing with consent and assault and that&#39;s basically put me off completely.

In The Shadow Casket, he loses everything that made him good and becomes this loser who can\u2019t make decisions. And the one time he actually shows conviction was giving the Ember Blade to Brita.
