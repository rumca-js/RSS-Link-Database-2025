        "description": "From Jurassic super fan to director of the franchise\u2019s latest installment, Gareth Edwards joins Jacqueline Coley to talk about his latest movie, Jurassic World Rebirth. He reflects on his path\u2014from creating the VFX shots himself in the film Monsters, to directing Rogue One, to taking on Spielberg\u2019s legacy of bringing the large-scale spectacle of dinosaurs to the big screen.\n\nGareth talks paying homage to his predecessors (from Jaws to Jurassic), why he was literally watching grass grow on set, and what it was like working with fellow Jurassic superfan Scarlett Johansson - along with the entire all-star cast of Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey.\n\nGareth reflects on the relevance of location based shooting, practical world building, why a healthy fear of tennis balls could come in handy and what it means to honor Jurassic lore, while making something new for the next generation.\n\nJurassic World Rebirth is in theaters July 2.\n\nFollow and listen to Seen on the Screen with Jacqueline Cole",
