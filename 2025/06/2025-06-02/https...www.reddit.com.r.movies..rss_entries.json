But you&#39;ve actually read enough or heard enough from that movie to be able to discuss it when it pops up in conversation. For me, the two most popular ones, and forgive me cause both have sequels and a great following, but I just can&#39;t get mysel to watch them. Mission Impossible films and John Wick films......

And the actor who played Mamiya really sold his role so well, I was clenching my jaw and holding my breath every time he was on screen. Long after it was over, I felt this weird emptiness I couldn&#39;t shake. Even now it feels like a fever dream and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve processed it all yet. </p> <p>Having said that, this is my favorite kind of horror. The eerie, atmospheric, creeping existential dread, decent into madness type of deal. I&#39;m definitely going to rewatch it at some point to see what I missed.

Again, I learned about it because a movie version was coming out. A lot of people seemed to like the book, and the descriptions piqued my interest. To get ready for the movie, I read the book.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So hello, everyone I am not here to antagonize anyone or cause issues. I am curious to know if this movie is the worst of the reboot craze. From where I am sitting it does a lot of harm to the source material and fails to uphold the legacy the film had. But my opinion isn&#39;t the only one so I often wondered what other people thought. I gave the film a shot a couple nights ago. Trying to see if it could match up to the original with Brandon Lee. </p> <p>My answer is I don&#39;t think it does, but now that I am comparing it to other reboots/remakes. I am wondering if it might be the worst one made. Btw I adore the actors in this but bad scripts do nobody favors. Bill performed amazingly in It and Nosferatu. So I am just putting this up as a discussion to see what everyone thinks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dbnerdcraft\"> /u/Dbnerdcraft </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movie",

There was tension and chemistry between them and they felt like a real divorced couple who were fighting old lingering feelings between them. And there were more comedic moments between them where I felt like in the remake the parents were just kind of like &quot;Oh hi.
