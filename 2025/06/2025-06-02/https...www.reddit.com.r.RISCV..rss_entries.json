Now instead of writing 4 would it not remain same as initial condition? and if so then how would cmderr set its state to (halt/resume) 4? Would highly appreciate if anyone can let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OddBelt9625\"> /u/OddBelt9625 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1l1ffcd/query_regarding_quick_access_command_in/\">[link]</a>",
