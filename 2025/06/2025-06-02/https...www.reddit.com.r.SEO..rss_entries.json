It wouldn\u2019t be about getting human eyeballs on your page anymore. It would be about making your content actionable by an AI agent.</p> <p>Feels like AI Overviews were just the beginning. Now we\u2019re moving from \u201czero-click\u201d to \u201czero-human.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone else thinking about how SEO strategies need to adapt for this?
