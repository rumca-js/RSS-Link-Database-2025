And he had such a unique sound. Sad yet weirdly peaceful. Emotional and raw yet polished. And it never felt forced or like he was chasing fame. He was a real artist with a real vision, and sadly we lost the rest of that vision.</p> <p>You can separate good artists from legendary artists by their ability to not just create good music, but a full atmosphere. And he released so many songs that make you feel like you\u2019re transcending into another universe. They\u2019re not just enjoyable to listen to, they hit a part of your brain that just feels. Not many artists have that ability.</p> <p>It felt like he had so much more behind him, especially after Swimming. But unfortunately he passed just over a month after that album was released. Circles was the closest thing we got to the continuation of his vision, as it was completed by the producer he was collab",

I also wanted to give people who might be curious about the music a way to understand a bit more without feeling like studying anything.</p> <p>I built a simple web app called <strong>Nota Bene</strong>. It works like a kind of \u201ccaption track\u201d for classical music: as you listen, it shows timed notes, structure, instrumentation, and musical moments, that evolve as the piece plays. No pop-ups or sound effects, just text and music. Totally free.</p> <p>Right now I only have a few recordings in there, including one of my own (Janacek - Mladi).</p> <p>I\u2019m not selling anything \u2014 just thought some of you might find it interesting.

Since I\u2019m a very small artist I\u2019m deciding to add CD exclusive bonus tracks to incentivize people to spend the $5 to get a CD. Me and my friend are both working on solo projects and we decided to remix one song from each of our solo projects to put on as a bonus track but still release the solo versions of the songs on our projects. So what would this be called? Because can it really be a remix of a song if the original song doesn\u2019t exist to the fandom? Is it a premix?
