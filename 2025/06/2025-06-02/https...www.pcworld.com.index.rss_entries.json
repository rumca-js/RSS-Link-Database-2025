I chose large and chunky parts, which the tower reflected in its sheer enormity. The size of it meant that it was never going to be something I could place on my desk without it looking out of place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was heavy too. But the base was skinny, so it wobbled when I moved it. I figured if it fell off the side of my desk it was going to cause some serious damage \u2014 if not to me, then my floor. So, under my desk it went to live, and it stayed there next to my legs as I played endless rounds of <em>Day of Defeat</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The position worked from a practical point of view, in that I had more space to spread out on my desk. I was glad it wasn\u2019t blowing hot air anywhere near my face, too. Overall, I was happy \u2014 I had a solid, reliable workhorse that wasn\u2019t an eyesore or a drop hazard.</p>\n\n\n",
