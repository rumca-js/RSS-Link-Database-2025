I love this increased role and whatnot since my previous position i felt stagnant- here i am learning daily and being challenged which i enjoy compared to being bored. </p> <p>i feel like a imposter at times and my imposter syndrome is at the highest it\u2019s ever been. </p> <p>for anyone who has taken a leap in their cyber career similar to this, whether it\u2019s becoming a senior or lead etc.. how do you manage the increased responsibility, duties etc?",

I got my bachelors with them and finished with a very high GPA. If you do their bachelors program you are already halfway through the masters. I have been working in cyber for five years. I don\u2019t want to get my masters anywhere else because it would take me too long. </p> <p>The rejection letter said they don\u2019t believe I\u2019m qualified for the program. The only thing I can of is maybe I missed a prompt on accident or didn\u2019t dress up for my video interview. I called them after I submitted everything and they said everything looked good and if I missed a prompt they would reach out to me. </p> <p>I plan on filing an appeal or reapplying but don\u2019t see the point unless they tell me why. </p> <p>Curious if this happened to anyone else. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Greedy-Fun3197\"> /u/Greedy-Fun3197 </a> <br",
