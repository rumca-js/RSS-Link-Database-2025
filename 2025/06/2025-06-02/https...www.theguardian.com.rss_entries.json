Something big.\u201d The three grim, heavy, black monochromatic paintings that greet you as you walk into this show, called Resistant Forms, at Spike Island, the first major retrospective of the Guyanese-British artist\u2019s work in the UK, have all the hallmarks of minimalism. They are dark, simple, ultra-formal images, a single colour on each canvas, covered in geometric grids, like Bauhaus in mourning. But the shapes and grids that define each work are not just experiments in form, they are not just an artist trying to push aesthetic boundaries: each is based on the architecture of the plantation.</p>",

Creamy, slightly tangy, savoury, full of roasted flavours and a little sweet, it\u2019s the ideal dressing for absolutely anything. It comes in squeezy bottles and is now widely available in larger supermarkets, but I\u2019ve created my own version here in case you can\u2019t find it. These lettuce cups make a fresh and crunchy snack that serves as a vessel for tender chicken and whatever herbs you have in the fridge. But first, a Japanified rendition of the Chinese dish mapo tofu, only more savoury and salty, and with a slightly thicker sauce. It\u2019s a strong contender for weekly dinner rotations, depending on what you have in your fridge, of course.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/02/spiced-aubergines-and-chicken-lettuce-cups-millie-tsukagoshi-lagare",
