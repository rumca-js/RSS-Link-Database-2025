It\u2019s in development and I\u2019m already in the works of building out the IP, pitch deck, and early prototypes. Just looking for honest thoughts before I go deeper.</p> <p>STRIDE is a smart indoor navigation system designed to optimize the in-person shopping experience. It uses a combo of attachable cart displays + a mobile app to guide customers through large retail environments like grocery stores, malls, airports, and stadiums. The goal is faster shopping for customers and better data + efficiency for retailers.</p> <p>How it works: Customers scan into a cart via QR or NFC, input their shopping list through the app, and receive an AI-optimized route through the store. The route adjusts live based on in-store congestion (captured from other STRIDE-enabled carts). No more wandering, backtracking, or getting stuck in crowded aisles.</p> <p>For retailers, STRIDE improves aisle",

No plates. No rules. You dig in with branded gloves, or your hands, or a fork if you insist.</p> <p>Think pasta or seafood boil, poured straight onto wax paper. It\u2019s messy, it\u2019s loud, and it\u2019s made for group hangs and viral content.</p> <p>The whole thing is part food, part chaos, part social experience.</p> <p>The Hook: Branded Gloves</p> <p>Every customer gets gloves on entry. They\u2019re reusable and branded, like merch.</p> <p>-Basic gloves are included -Premium gloves rotate (limited drops, glow-in-the-dark, glitter, themes) -Gloves become ",

I even made a Chrome extension so it can block distracting sites during focus time.</p> <p>After that, I shared it with some friends. To my surprise, they loved it and are still using it every single day. That gave me the motivation and validation I needed, so I started posting about it in some study groups and subreddits.</p> <p>So far, the site got over 600 visitors and some of them still use it daily.</p> <p>The hard part?</p> <p>Getting people to come back. They like it, but staying top of mind is tricky as there are some many Pomodoro tools. My current plan is to build a small analytics feature that tracks their study habits, then send a daily summary email to help them reflect and stay consistent.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude4f Thanks for rea",
