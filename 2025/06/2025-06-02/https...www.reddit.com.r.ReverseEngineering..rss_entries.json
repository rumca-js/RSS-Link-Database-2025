And Neopets \u2014 A site whose games were all in Flash \u2014 had to scramble to port all their games over to HTML5. They made a few of these ports before Ruffle came to prominence, rendering all of their Flash games playable again.</p> <p>But in the haste to port their games, The Neopets Team introduced a lot of bugs into their games.</p> <p>I wanted to see how difficult it would be to fix all the bugs in a modern port of one of my favorite childhood flash games.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t foresee having to strip back multiple layers of JavaScript obfuscation to fix all these bugs.</p> <p>Thankfully, I was able to break it and documented most of it in my post.</p> <p>Since all the bugs were easy to fix, I decided to improve the game too by upping the framerate \u2014 even allowing it to be synced with the browser&#39;s refresh rate \u2014 and adding a settings menu to toggle mobile compatibility off on desktop.</p> </d",
