We&#39;re actually working on Solaris 10 SPARC and we really, <em>really</em> do not want to write our own package manager. We got dpkg to compile on Solaris but apt won&#39;t, it needs Linux-specific functions, mostly locking-related. APK also refuses to build due to lack of locking functions, flock() isn&#39;t available in our envuironment. Is there anythign really simple that still does network catalogues + dep resolution and the like? Again: we could write our own, but we really, really do not want to.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatSuccubusLilith\"> /u/ThatSuccubusLilith </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1l1cei5/most_portable_networkenabled_package_manager/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
