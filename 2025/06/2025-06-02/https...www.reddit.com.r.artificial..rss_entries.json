It combines images it&#39;s trained on with images of artists who don&#39;t want to use them in this way. Well, they have the right to protect their creative works from being used for profit. When we look at AI stripped of this point, we&#39;ll see that it&#39;s not a problem to replace artists. This is the price of evolution, but it didn&#39;t start in an ethical way. Replacing artists by using their drawings, which they didn&#39;t originally agree to, is a crime. This is not like borrowing human art, which still maintains an individual characteristic and still requires individual effort to produce. Second, AI drawings are soulless and meaningless. I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t expertly crafted. They are, and they&#39;re evolving in that, but there will always be a void in them every time you look at them.
