What always allured me is transgressive characters and stories, like for example American Psycho, however i wasn&#39;t a fan of Elis&#39;s writing style. My most recent book was 1984, I found the language very precise but quite descriptive, it was like watching a movie. I also read The Crash by Ballard which honestly made me fasten every time I drive in a taxi lol. I read shorter stuff like Poe stories, Slaughterhouse 5, Herbert Wells, I&#39;d say it was all great in it&#39;s own way. And finally I have Catch 22 on a bookshelf, haven&#39;t opened it yet. I really want to look into something more modern, but I haven&#39;t read a lot of classics still. In short, I want the book to be a well-written, crash",

Like I love that but this particular brand of escapism is hurting my mental health and my expectations in relationships. I\u2019d like to read something that is more about inner personal strength/values, dabbles in romance and maybe a bit of sex but isn\u2019t an instant 100% soulmate relationship. Maybe they break up maybe not but it\u2019s definitely messier than the conflict (which I found the be very unrelatable) between Rhys/Feyre or like Xaden/Violent (in iron flame). Something less driven by anger/secrets and more about a character practicing emotional control, self soothing, and communication. I really liked how SJM showed some relationships with flaws and those relationships dissolved and the characters moved on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",

I remember wayback 2012 to early 2018, I was reading like there is no tomorrow. Then suddenly, I just stopped.</p> <p>I do read from time to time but I couldn\u2019t finish it anymore. Or if I do finish it, it takes me like a week to do it or more. Gone are my days of reading a book in one sitting.. But since my cousin gifted me a new kindle for my birthday, I got so excited to get back into it. Though, I\u2019m really not updated anymore with all the new titles coming out.</p> <p>My current read right now is the Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros and I\u2019m really enjoying it.</p> <p>Any other book recommendations so that I won\u2019t get into a slump after?</p> <p>I like different genres but mostly I like thrillers, romance, fantasy, book with cats, meet-cutes, new adult. Basically anything except for non-fiction and self help right now. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",

I loved reading when I was younger, but in college I have had a hard time sitting down and enjoying a book. I think it\u2019s from reading 200+ pages from a textbook weekly. Here is the deal, I want to buy a book that will have me so enthralled I don\u2019t want to put it down. Here is what I like:</p> <ul> <li>Redemption Stories </li> </ul> <p>-True crime</p> <p>-Mind boggling plot twist stories </p> <ul> <li><p>Thrillers </p></li> <li><p>Horror </p></li> <li><p>Realistic fiction or </p></li> <li><p>Memoirs </p></li> </ul> <p>It does not have to fit every one of these, and it really doesn\u2019t have to fit any of them. However I am not a huge fan of fantasy/aliens/romance. I\u2019m okay with historical fiction or even time travel. Really open to mostly anything, I am just excited to read for pleasure and not for a grade! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tart2343\"> /u/Ta",
