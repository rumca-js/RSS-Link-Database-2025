Piracy dramatically increases the chances that a piece of media will never become lost for good. </p> <p>Best argument against is that the smaller and more recent the team of creatives the more likely it is that piracy has a real world impact on their ability to make money from their art. This reduces the likelihood that they will continue to try to produce commercial products. </p> <p>A caveat I will add is that it is very unlikely that anybody has ever produced something that was tormented so much they were actually unable to make a profit. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/knightmare0019\"> /u/knightmare0019 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1l1p7bk/what_are_your_best_arguments_both_for_and_against/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",

For a little while now I&#39;m having an issue with Deluge where downloads kick a gear on when I open it but within a min or so fall to nothing, from 5mbs to 0kbps, however Upload speed holds strong at 2mbs or so. Looking at the &#39;Peers&#39; tab as soon as I open it has a few appear then they seem to disappear within a few seconds. I can&#39;t seem to figure out what is happening. </p> <p>So far all I can think is low seeders but that wouldn&#39;t explain why it kicks up to 5mbps and then falls off, also the same thing is happening with torrents that have over 1k seeders too. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shrike2214\"> /u/shrike2214 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1l1hcfx/curious_problem_with_deluge/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/",

How does that work?</p> <p>Won&#39;t the program realize it&#39;s modded and deny you entry? Do you risk having your app account banned? Do you risk your google account getting in trouble? Can you use online functions of the app?</p> <p>My question is mostly theoretical curiousity but also about getting older versions of apps where the new version is buggy on my device - most downloads I find have been modded.
