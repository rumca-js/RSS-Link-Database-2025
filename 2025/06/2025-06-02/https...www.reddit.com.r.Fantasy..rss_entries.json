It is a story set in a &quot;perspective flip&quot; Cthulhu Mythos. The basic idea behind the Innsmouth Legacy is the Cthulhu Mythos is not actively hostile but simply different. The Deep Ones are just another race of human beings, the Mi-Go are busy-bodies who want to make humans better, the Yithians (actually the Yithians are much worse). It moves the setting from the realm of horror into that of science fiction.</p> <p>I don&#39;t mind authors doing this sort of thing and actually think more people should. Basically, there&#39;s no point to trying to ape H.P. Lovecraft&#39;s prose but much benefit to adding your own spin on his universe.
