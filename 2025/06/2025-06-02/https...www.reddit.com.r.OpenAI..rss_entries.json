Have anyone also noticed a change in their personal thinking and way to communicate after using AI? To explain, I come from a tech background, data engineer with a heart filled with numbers you could say. I was crunching efficiency problems rather than communication and I was never good with this emotion stuff \ud83d\ude05. Over the last years I started using AI, mainly for slave... eh &quot;assistant&quot; work, like &#39;build a text out of my notes&#39; kind of stuff. But lately about 3 months ago I started using AI to sort my thoughts. Like a back talking diary. And a few days ago I realized that I also started to analyze communication. And I am leaving the &quot;meta line&quot; of a dialog and starting to bring up rather deep topics which I would have never done a year ago. So, any one else noticed something like that?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

According to OpenAI&#39;s documentation, Pro users should have near-unlimited access to the o3 model, but I&#39;m experiencing significant limitations that don&#39;t match what was promised for the Pro tier.Additionally, the Deep Search functionality (capped at 120 queries/month for Pro users) isn&#39;t working at all. I&#39;ve confirmed my Pro subscription is active, but these features are either restricted or completely broken, and it&#39;s disrupting my workflow.Has anyone else encountered similar problems with the o3 model or Deep Search on a Pro plan? Any workarounds or fixes? I&#39;ve already contacted OpenAI support, but I&#39;m hoping the community has insights or solutions in the meantime.

I had to argue with Gemini and pinpoint that my question was if I can or can&#39;t, but it went on to explain the risks and things that I should be wary of.
