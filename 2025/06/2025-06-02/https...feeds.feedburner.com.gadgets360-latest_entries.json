        "description": "A groundbreaking genetic study published in Current Biology reveals that the Maya civilization didn\u2019t mysteriously vanish around 1,200 years ago, as once thought. By analyzing ancient genomes from Cop\u00e1n in western Honduras, researchers discovered strong genetic continuity from the Late Archaic era to modern Maya groups. This evidence challenges the idea of collapse and instead points to a large-scale social reorganization. The Maya people adapted to environmental and political upheaval, preserving their identity and culture through centuries of transformation and migration.",

With a highly elongated orbit and large size, it contradicts the Planet Nine hypothesis, which predicted orbital clustering among distant objects. This finding not only questions the existence of a ninth planet but also suggests many more icy bodies may lie hidden in the Scattered Disk and beyond. Detected through archival data, 2017 OF201 adds a critical piece to the puzzle of our solar system\u2019s unexplored frontier.",
