I got my valve index nearly at launch and between the covid pandemic and now have amassed 7k hours since like 2018. I never used to have any eye pain or discomfort at all with the headset and have gone through many different face gasket replacements and cables over the years. </p> <p>In the last like 8 months however my eyes seem to hate the Index now, they&#39;re constantly watering up, the sweet spot seems to be much smaller and I&#39;m just overall not able to enjoy my time in it anymore. It seems like the headset is just drying my eyes out extremely, perhaps because the gasket itself is limiting drainage because of where it&#39;s pushing into my face around my eyes?

I messed around with the bit rate and turned off and on the automatic bit rate but it still stays at around 70-90ms. If I turn off Spacewarp the FPS gets really bad. Changing the codec makes everything worse too, HEVC 10 bit seems to the best I can get. I get these numbers in every game, VRChat is the only game where the Game ms is spiking tho. I can\u2019t use the latest AMD drivers before anyone mentions that because it makes my gpu crash constantly (seems like a common issue currently).</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/44dfe9emre4f1.jpg?width=",
