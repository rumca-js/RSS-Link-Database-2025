We have accumulated over 10TB of home movies and photos and they now seem to be... lost. We had a family party and I had a couple fireball shots and accidentally knocked over the nas running the drives. I have 4, 10tb drives in raid 0 for redundancy and had plenty of free space (20ish tb still) so i&#39;m not worried about it being a maxed out drive issue. The server is running ubuntu 20 and immich was running in a docker container with the data in a bind mount. since i had it in raid 0 I figured I did not need any other backups. I have tried a couple recovery tools but everything i see on google says my data is completely gone? There are so many family members personal and business media on there and they are super upset. Can anyone please recommend some recovery tools to try and recover my data?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",

I have now i3-12100 with 4 P-cores (8 threads) with no E-core and it is enough for my purpose (proxmox with couple lxc/vm - one of which is truenas scale wioth passthrough drives. Plex has access to quicksync). It is surprisingly fast for my usage but there is little to no reserve (immich took 24h to match faces after setting up library). I see some cheap 13-14 gen cpus, like 13700 or 14500T and wonder if adding E-cores will result in lower power consumption? or maybe it will be more of a headache then improvement. Is it worth going for T series cpu or you can have same result with undervolting regular one? maybe Truenas Scale has better support for this kind of architecture?

Does anyone know the proper configuration for either? My main goal is <strong>not to have to open ports on my router</strong></p> <p>I already check that my npm instance on docker expose 80:80 and 443:443, but I have no idea what ip or url put in cloudflare to do the redirection</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/srmstty\"> /u/srmstty </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted",
