The only issue is that my phone isn&#39;t compatible with any alternative ROMs, and right now, I can&#39;t afford to buy one that is. So, I have to make the most of what I&#39;ve got. I haven&#39;t found many suggestions for cases like mine. From what little I did find, it seems there are two things I can still do:<br/> 1) Remove the Google and Samsung accounts from the phone;<br/> 2) Make use of ADB.<br/> Is there anything else I can do, or do you have any advice about these two steps?<br/> One last thing\u2014should I replace the system&#39;s phone, gallery, contacts, and camera apps, or can I leave them as they are?<br/> Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Banco0176\"> /u/Banco0176 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/commen",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Back with a degoogle question. A couple of months ago I was pretty interested in the Pixel with GOS. The plan was to wait for the Pixel 10 and make the switch from iOS to GOS when the phone is available. As I am using iOS I see how much big tech is having a influence in my daily life and it makes it actually easier at certain points. For example I lost my debit card a while ago. Thanks to the Apple Wallet I was able to pay without having the card with me.</p> <p>I am doubting if switching to GOS will be too much. Yes, I care about my privacy but I don\u2019t want to lose some of the convenience I have right now. So question to all the degoogled Android users, is it possible to delete certain apps and replace them with FOSS alternatives? For example:</p> <p>Aves Gallery instead of Google Photo\u2019s Heliboard instead of G-board Aurora and Droidify instead of Play Store</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",
