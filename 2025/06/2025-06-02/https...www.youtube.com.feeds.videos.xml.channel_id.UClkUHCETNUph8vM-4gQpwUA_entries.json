        "description": "Elden Ring Nightreign - YOU'RE PLAYING IT WRONG!\nIn this Elden Ring Nightreign video, we're going to be talking about how you're probably playing Nightreign wrong. There are a lot of new players out there who are making a lot of mistakes that most of us have made. When we first started learning this game, they may have been having a rough time with it, but there is a point where this game clicks for you when you get far enough into the game, and this is one of the reasons that we gave it such a review score on the channel once this game really clicked. That's when the fun starts happening in this game, and you have to play enough to really get to that point and really understand some of the mechanics of that. So in this video, we're going to go through some things that will further help you get through your playthrough. Kind of illustrates some things that might show you how you're doing things incorrectly.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/E",
