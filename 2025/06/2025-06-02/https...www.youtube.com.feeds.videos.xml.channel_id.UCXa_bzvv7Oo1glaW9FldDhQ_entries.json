Shooting, driving, and shooting while driving make up a significant portion of the gameplay loop. The last thing expected from this \"20ish\" hours journey is that it's the middle point of a grand narrative that goes 10,000 years into the past and somewhere into the future.\n\nConfused? Well, Leslie Benzies, director and studio founder, revealed an overarching ten-year plan, which involves an open-world multiplayer sequel launching next year and an open-world free-roam title to bridge the gap.

        "description": "Games, like other narrative media, have a defined structure. That structure may be composed of an beginning, middle, and conclusion, but some of the more creative games opt to do something different. These 10 games alter their gameplay structure or story rather significantly after the introductory hour, leading to an unexpected and intriguing experience. \n\nIt should be noted that what constitutes an hour may change based on playstyle. Speedrunners can blaze through the opening section of Prey rather quick while the more leisurely player spends time reading every note. The spirit of this list lies in a game\u2019s ability to switch up its structure and narrative after the intro section, contrasting its intro with the rest of the game in a big way.",
