If a system is a &quot;black box,&quot; how can we truly trust its decisions?

With projects like 0xArgu-mint, if an AI misbehaves, you could perform a &quot;digital autopsy.&quot; Ruoff put it well: &quot;AI has no memory right now.

But even before that, you\u2019ve got to figure out what to write and why. What\u2019s your story? What\u2019s it about? Then you can brainstorm characters and plot ideas. And then you\u2019ve got worldbuilding. Worldbuilding\u2014especially in fantasy\u2014is, in my opinion, more important than the writing itself. Especially in fantasy, you have to create a world that feels real. A world that feels original. And if you\u2019re really into it, you can even create languages. That\u2019s something that takes real effort. That\u2019s something that\u2019s not simple.</p> <p>Using AI to assist with these tasks isn\u2019t just a time saver\u2014it\u2019s a mind saver.

This move poses a significant challenge to traditional advertising and media agencies by streamlining ad creation and management directly through Meta\u2019s platform, thereby making advanced marketing accessible to small and medium-sized businesses. While Meta emphasizes the continued value of agencies, this development has already impacted major ad firms, with shares of companies like WPP and Publicis Groupe experiencing declines.
