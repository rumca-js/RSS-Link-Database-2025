That&#39;s how I feel about this book.</p> <p>It\u2019s an Italian classic by Italo Svevo, where we follow three characters making each other miserable through the most narcissistic and manipulative friendships and relationships you can imagine. And then there\u2019s a fourth character, quietly suffering under the weight of it all.</p> <p>The lack of communication, empathy, and honesty between them is frustrating to read and can be scarily relatable - especially in today&#39;s &quot;touchscreen society&quot;.</p> <p>The original title, <em>Senilit\u00e0</em> (literally \u201cSenility\u201d), refers to that maddening loop people fall into: going back to toxic relationships even when they know better, and the cognitive dissonance they (willingly) fall prey to in the process.</p> <p>It\u2019s beautifully written, and the psychological depth is incredible. You\u2019ll end up hating every character, which is exactly what Svevo intende",
