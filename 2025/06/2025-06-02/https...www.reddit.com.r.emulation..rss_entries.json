Note that because it is a compressed format, it won&#39;t load as fast as raw, uncompressed images. You can enable the Preload disc images to RAM if you experience hiccups during gameplay.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/StrikerX3/Ymir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">Changelog</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NXGZ\"> /u/N",
