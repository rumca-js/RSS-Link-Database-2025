I set up Linux, enabled Crostini GPU, etc. Now months later, I tried opening the launcher but the icon stays loading forever and never opens. Then I tried uninstalling the launcher but that wasn&#39;t working either. I couldn&#39;t find a reason why it was no longer working, so I ended up powerwashing my chromebook and starting the process all over again, but although I followed the same steps exactly, it opens an &#39;updating launcher&#39; screen, that finishes, and then it is still not opening. Because that didn&#39;t work, I tried a different tutorial found <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-minecraft-on-linux/\">here</a>, but that didn&#39;t work either; it says this: <strong>error while loading shared libraries: libO",

I started with Fedora but eventually my steam games wouldn&#39;t load for some reason, so I decided to ditch the whole thing and go with Bazzite instead. I just installed it but I think it still sees my old drives, so I&#39;m currently shredding my storage drive I was using for my steam library. But while I&#39;m doing that, I figured I&#39;d reach out and ask why steam might not be seeing my other drives/allowing me to add them through settings. I do know enough to know that they&#39;re mounted drives, but with Bazzite that&#39;s about it. With Fedora I thought I got around it with using Flatseal, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the solution here.

I finally got around to it, mostly because Steam games started not launching due to the &quot;too many clients&quot; issue from X11 sessions (possibly steam-for-linux/issues/9561 on the github), so I installed updates and rebooted.</p> <p>Anyway, after I rebooted, none of the games I tried playing would play any sound. I tried native, native added as non-steam game, native but from the steam store, non-native games through proton that I had played earlier in the day. There is no speaker icon on the program either. But Firefox and videos on store pages in Steam play audio no problem.</p> <p>Lots of troubleshooting later, I find that if I set sound to &quot;Analog Stereo Output&quot; I get sound, albeit only on two speakers, as one would expect. If I switch back to &quot;Analog Surround 5.1&quot;, I get nothing. In fact, I get nothing on any of the other &quot;Analog Surround&quot; se",
