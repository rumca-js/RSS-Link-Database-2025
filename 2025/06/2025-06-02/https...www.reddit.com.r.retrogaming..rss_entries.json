I currently have an old HP laptop that is on the end of it&#39;s life, so I am going to be buying a new laptop for my personal stuff and then I&#39;d like to get a second computer specifically for playing old games on.

As a result I am picking up consoles I never had as a kid, the Saturn is one such thing. But I really wanted to play Virtua Cop with the light gun. All I can see suggests I need to buy a CRT. Or use some emulator to play the game on a PC or similar. There was a setup I saw on YouTube using a raspberrypi and a wii remote, but that is a pain in the neck. I can\u2019t see any real suggestions since 2022 so wondered if anyone has a solution to this yet other than buy an old tv.

He is not tech savvy whatsoever, so it really just needs to work once initially set up.</p> <p>I have dabbled with emudeck with some front ends. However that required constant configuration when switching controllers, plugging into tv vs handheld, and I feel like if I were to go that route he would end up just not using it as he\u2019d have to always reach out for help.</p> <p>He mainly has interest in 80\u2019s 90s games, Atari n64 etc.</p> <p>Open to any and all advice.

Admittedly there are games where such a system would be utterly dreadful. Imagine playing something like Elden Ring with limited lives. It would be a nightmare to play through.</p> <p>But I do think that the limited lives mechanic serves a purpose outside of stretching out the run time for old games. To me, it helps encourage me to perfect the game mechanics, in order to clear each game as efficiently as possible.</p> <p>The best way to describe this would be to compare my playthroughs of Halo 1 and the entire Mega Man series. Halo 1 was a game where I frequently just dashed past all the enemies, killing as few as possible, and hoping to reach the next checkpoint.

Is the cmedia more compatible? To my understanding they both use DSDMA so a Live! card could utilize EAX if booting into windows with this chipset.</p> <p>What about using SBEMU instead of a sound card at all? I\u2019m not super concerned with 100% compatible stuff as that would mean just bending the knee to an ISA capable motherboard.</p> <p>I was given a nifty little C2Q mobo/cpu/ram combo and don\u2019t have much use for it as I already have an Ivy Bridge system with an XFi card but if real mode DOS ends up being a valid use case, I can justify putting it in a cool case.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/crashprime\"> /u/crashprime </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
