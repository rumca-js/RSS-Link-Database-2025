Obviously I have read the rules so i&#39;m not asking anybody to do anything for me, but i do have a question.</p> <p>Essentially what has happened is that when i was around 12 or so, i created a Ubisoft account on my PS3. Due to an automatic login system, i never needed to change my email address or password with the account. When i finally got a PC i stupidly unlinked my psn account from ubisoft. Due to this i have no access to anything i have purchased through ubisoft including R6 credits and a lot of other stuff. My cross save progression is also gone.</p> <p>My question is, would it be possible to be able to hack the account by only knowing the account nickname and would it be an easy thing to do or not? I really don&#39;t want to lose everything I have paid for over 15 years and at this point ubisoft support is going in circles and are unwilling to cooperate. Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC",
