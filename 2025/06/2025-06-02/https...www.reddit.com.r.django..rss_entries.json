It&#39;s a fairly old course, so I have had to go around a lot of the stuff that needs to be done differently with Python, Django, and all the frameworks it uses.</p> <p>Recently, there has been a section where it&#39;s the deployment phase, and they use Python anywhere. Over there, I am stuck in a problem where my webapp uses Python 3.13, but PythonAnywhere only supports up to Python 3.11. Is there any way to go around it?</p> <p>&quot;This virtualenv seems to have the wrong Python version (3.11 instead of 3.13).&quot; </p> <p>This is the exact error I get. I tried deleting the venv and then installing with Python 3.13 and 3.11 both, but it doesn&#39;t work. </p> <p>I would be very grateful to get some tips/alternatives to PythonAnywhere, which is still fairly easy to use with tutorials, as I am still learning.<br/> Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
