        "description": "<p>Prime minister to launch strategic defence review in Glasgow this morning</p><p>Good morning. In his great history of 20th century Britain, The Rise and Fall of the British Nation, David Edgerton uses the phrase \u201cwarfare state\u201d to describe the UK under the post-war Attlee government, and its successors. He does so to make the point that, although we think of that period as the era of the welfare state, defence spending was still huge (around 10% of GDP in the early 1950s). <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> is not going to get close to that, but \u201cwarfare state\u201d still feels like a useful term to describe at least the direction in which he wants to shove Britain, as the strategic defence review being published today will indicate.</p><p>Starmer will be interviewed on the Today programme shortly. Here is <strong>Dan Sabbagh</strong>\u2019s overnight preview story on what the defence review will say.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/02/defence-spending-review-army-",
