It checks a lot of boxes for my specific needs and it&#39;s relatively easy to learn and use. Also like the microkernel architecture (something I didn&#39;t even understand until I looked it up) that seems to keep the core opensource functionality stable with new features and capabilities coming from plugins. From what I can see, this allows you to build new plugins for new features while keeping yourself out of trouble (by not messing with the core codebase) in case something goes wrong with the plugins. </p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear from anyone with experience building custom plugins for Nocobase.
