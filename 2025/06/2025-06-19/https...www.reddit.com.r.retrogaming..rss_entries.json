Currently I only have the OG demo disc (PAL version) but now I&#39;m looking into buying the standalone games. I was always into the adventure /platform genre. I just loved the sense of adventure and escapism. Specifically Spyro,Croc, Crash Bandicoot, Tomba, Rayman, The Mummy, Bugs Bunny Lost in Time, and even Little Big Adventure. The aforementioned games I will most certainly purchase, however if you guys know of other hidden gems that fit into this category please let me know. Nothing too fast paced. </p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/M-dog2000\"> /u/M-dog2000 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lf4foi/looking_for_recommendations_for_ps1_adventure/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lf4foi/looking_fo",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This was initially a response to a comment on a another post asking about how the younger generation feels about retro gaming. Here is my VERY long rant of a response.</p> <p>TLDR: I love modern gaming but keep coming back to older games because of how instantly understandable and easy to pick up they are.</p> <p>I think that the biggest difference between retro and modern games is scope. With old games there aren&#39;t huge skill trees or massive open worlds with a million different side quests, its mostly what you see is what you get. For example I loved Donkey Kong Country because it was short and fun to master, Mega Man X because it forced me to get good at its mechanics to progress, and Clock Tower because ya&#39;ll the pixel guy with the scissors is scary. I had all of that fun with 6 buttons and a D-pad. I think this is the heart of why people love old games, its not that they were better its that they often offer a simple but complete vision. ",
