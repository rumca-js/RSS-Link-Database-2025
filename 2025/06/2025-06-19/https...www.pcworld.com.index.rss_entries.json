These dampers\u2014called gaskets\u2014act like shock absorbers, reducing pressure with every keystroke and creating a springy, pleasant typing sensation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to many rigid keyboards, typing on the Gasket Mount is smoother and more flexible. This design also has clear acoustic advantages, as it minimizes annoying resonances and instead emphasizes the acoustics of the switches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the type of switch used, the sound can range from deep and subdued to clear and crisp. At the same time, the dampers help compensate for minor manufacturing tolerances, contributing to a more consistent overall typing feel.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"uploadedSrc\":false,",
