I see a lot of glowing reviews for it, but after finishing it I just feel very &#39;meh&#39;. </p> <p>To start, I feel the back of the book&#39;s back cover was false advertising of sorts. I went in expecting a focus to be on the octopuses and the interactions between Dr. Ha Nguyen. But that felt like maybe 25% of the book. The books focus seemed to be more on the concept of AI consciousness and where is &quot;the edge&quot; as the book puts it. </p> <p>Everytime the book focused on Ha and Evrim I was engrossed. I found it really enjoyable to read about the methodology and trying to figure out what the octopuses are saying. Are they being inviting? Stand-offish? This is what I was looking to read about! </p> <p>I&#39;m a little lost with the story of the hacker(?) Rustem and why his portions kept bringing up the stor",

In it, you can search and filter by title, author, ISBN, book synopsis and publisher. What I usually do is to fill in the publisher I want the book from and in the synopsis field I write a keyword of the topic I want the book to be about. </p> <p>If I haven&#39;t explained myself well in the previous paragraph here goes an example.

The more I read, the more of a fan I become of him. The Detective Kaga series was one of his famous series, and &quot;The Final Curtain&quot; is apparently the last book in the series, and the later books are centered around Kaga&#39;s cousin Shuhei Matsumiya. As one could anticipate from Keigo Higashino, this book was outstanding. The characters&#39; complexity and the way their previous deeds influenced their dying moments were the best aspects of this book. </p> <p>From the back:</p> <p><em>&quot;Michiko Oshitani is found dead many miles from home. Strangled to death, left in the bare apartment rented under a false name by a man who has disappeared without a trace. Oshitani lived far away in Sendai, with no known connection to Tokyo, and neither her family nor friends have any idea why she would have gone there.<",

I like the rare interview when host and guest have a shared interest, it&#39;s like watching people speak the same language.</p> <p>Honestly, I wish it had gone on longer; I am fascinated about the process of reading for a purpose like she is for the Booker Prize.</p> <p>First 3:30ish are about And Just Like That.
