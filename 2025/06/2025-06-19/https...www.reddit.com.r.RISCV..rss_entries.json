Then my PC jumps to the ISR location, but inside the ISR, how can I know what caused the interrupt, whether it is SPI or UART?</p> <p>PC would jump to the same ISR location just based on the cause.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I&#39;m embraking on a new project with RISC-V, but the only computer architecture experience I have is a course on contemporary logic design and a course on systems programming. As a result, I know Vivado and Linux-based C development to some extent. However, in my current project, I have been asked to implement a RISC-V core (specifically Ibex) on an FPGA. The problem is, I have no idea how to set up the core on an FPGA, nor do I know how to upload software on it to run certain programs. I have gone through the documentation of Ibex, but I didn&#39;t understand how to get the core on an FPGA. Are there any resources that you would recommend to get me started? Thanks so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imaginaryelement\"> /u/imaginaryelement </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1lf8ky7/how_to_get_started/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"htt",
