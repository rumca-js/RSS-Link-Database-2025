        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Last year, a friend and I started a project \u2014 a notification daemon designed specifically for modern Wayland compositors, built entirely in Rust. After about a year of work, we created something truly usable and with features we\u2019re proud of. I\u2019ve been running it as my daily notification daemon since early on, so it\u2019s not just a prototype \u2014 it\u2019s solid and practical.</p> <p>But after pushing hard for so long, we hit a serious burnout a couple months ago. Since then, the project\u2019s been quiet \u2014 no new updates, no big release. We wanted to finish all the core features and release a 0.1 version with a big announcement, but that never happened.</p> <p>I\u2019m sharing this now because, even if I can\u2019t keep working on it, I want the community to know it exists. Maybe someone out there will find it useful, or maybe it\u2019ll inspire others to do something similar or even pick it up.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https://github.com/not",

These data are relatively large (~1-2GB for long context) and are often evicted when GPU memory is not enough. In these cases, when users ask a follow up question, the software needs to recompute for the same KV Cache. LMCache is designed to combat that by efficiently offloading and loading these KV cache to and from DRAM and disk.</p> <p>Ask us anything!</p> <p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache\">https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nice-Comfortable-650\"> /u/Nice-Comfortable-650 </a",
