The obvious are easy. </p> <p>Is there some sort of site that shows the best of the best of our favorite way to get overproduced shelf-stealing games?</p> <p>Not looking for any specific game recommendations, just whether someone already tracks crowdfunding stats that mashup BGG ratings and play counts or something like that. Maybe the BGG would even have this with the crowdfunding tag, so probably just someone making use of the BGG API.

We have Carcassonne, Catan, Cascadia, Ticket to Ride, The Quest for El Dorado and a few more. She mostly likes fairly easy to learn games without too many mechanics. I\u2019ve been thinking about Azul as a good option maybe? Any suggestions are appreciated!</p> <p>Bonus if you have suggestions that sre also fun for 4 players for when we have company!</p> <p>Edit: we also have card games like multiple UNO variants, but they aren\u2019t really great for two players IMO. We have Skip-bo also which is better</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/coriscaa\"> /u/coriscaa </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lfcdbn/getting_my_gf_into_board_games_what_should_we_try/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/",

She was in tears, she was complaining about not having any idea of what was going on, and that it was unfair we had to lose all the link tiles. She was very clear she was not having a good time.</p> <p>So we decided to stop the game there, no need to keep going if someone is having a miserable time. I am a bit bummed because I was actually really enjoying the crunchiness of the game with the very low setup and teardown effort. And found the positive interaction so good! But it seems we will not be playing this game anytime soon.</p> <p>We have over 100+ games, and this is the first time i&#39;ve ever seen her get this upset mid-game.</p> <p>Has anybody had a similar experience, jave any tips on how I can make the experience of this game somewhat better?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",
