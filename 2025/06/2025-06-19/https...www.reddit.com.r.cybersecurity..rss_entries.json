Lately, I\u2019ve been testing out tweetfeed.live since it updates regularly and has a \u201cHunt\u201d tab with prebuilt queries. Some of those queries gave me false positives, and after tweaking them, nothing came up \u2014 which I guess is good. But still, it made me question how reliable the source actually is.</p> <p>I even brought the site up during a meeting, and when we checked out a random link, it led to a Twitter post of a squirrel with a link\u2026 so yeah, not the most confidence-inspiring.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to find something better that we could actually use or possibly integrate.
