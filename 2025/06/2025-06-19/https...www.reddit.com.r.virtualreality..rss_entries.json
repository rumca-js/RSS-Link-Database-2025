I get that this eats vram like breakfast, and 6GB on good safety settings just aint it at 3328 x 1664 res (Quest 2 with Oculus killer on link cable) So i been considering upgrading to a RTX 5070, though looking at 12GB of vram, i don&#39;t think that will be enough even. I don&#39;t wanna dish out 900+ on a GPU either for 16GB, and i hate that AMD GPU s are very weird with VR and unstable. so Should i wait it out for the rumored super variant? as it may have 15GB to 18GB of vram and under the 5070 ti price point (hopefully)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Petabyte_beep\"> /u/Petabyte_beep </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lfn8an/rtx_5070_or_wa",

It\u2019s been fine for recording and streaming with low graphics and at lower encoding settings.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been thinking of upgrading for a while, especially once the new generation of graphics cards sets in. I\u2019m definitely considering switching to a desktop PC. I\u2019m trying to figure out which GPU is going to be better for the price for VR. I don\u2019t want to go over $2000 for the whole PC.
