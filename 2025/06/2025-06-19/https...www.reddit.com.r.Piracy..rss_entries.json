This is my first post here and I wanted to get streamio to stream because I read here that is doesn&#39;t buffer as much as the sites (even if you don&#39;t pay for a subscription in RD or something). I also read that I should get torentio. I live in Greece and there was a new law recently that there is a 700\u20ac fine if you&#39;re caught pirating and most people said that it would be hard to enforce unless you torrent if I remember correctly. Sorry again if everything I&#39;ve said was completely stupid. With all that said, how risky is it for me to use streamio and is the benefit actually that big compared to streaming sites?

So I used a service to turn the video into an mp3 and I put it onto my spotify. All good, and I thought it was fine. Then I saw mentioned that some people got hefty fine, letters, or their internet shut down by their ISP. I also saw mentioned that your ISP would be aware of you doing it if you don&#39;t have a VPN, which I can&#39;t afford. I live with my parents and really don&#39;t want them to recieve a fine or get in legal trouble. The career I want to pursue also requires a clean record and I would never forgive myself if I just ruined my chances of pursuing it. I&#39;ve only downloaded 2 songs so far, and wanted to download more. But frankly I&#39;m terrified in the next few days I&#39;m going to receive a fine in the mail or get in trouble with law enforcement. I apologize if I sound ridiculous, but I didn&#39;t grow up in the 90s/00s and internet surveill",
