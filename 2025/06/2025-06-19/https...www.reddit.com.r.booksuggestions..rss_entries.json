Also i&#39;m looking for books that are less on the romantic side and focus or on the actually topic of the book. I&#39;m either looking for something with 1 main protagonist or a couple of people coming together to solve something like a murder mystery. Give me any books you think are like this. Also it does not have to be a murder mystery and can also just be general thriller and suspense.

What begins as a raw, intimate portrait of mental illness gradually reveals a deeper, more spiritual journey when Ryan encounters Liam, an ethereal boy from the Dimension of Light. Their growing friendship becomes the soul of the story, as Liam helps Ryan rediscover his worth, while Ryan teaches Liam how to feel.</p> <p>But Liam isn\u2019t just a friend\u2014he\u2019s a cosmic being with telekinesis, holographic memory projection, and the ability to manipulate light itself. His presence on Earth must remain secret, especially as a creeping darkness threatens to expose him. This darkness, a parasitic force that feeds on despair and infiltrates the minds of the vulnerable, begins to increase as threat. As Liam\u2019s powers grow",

I am very interested with those very old-school kind of mysteries, like the Agatha Christie movie adaptations with Hercule Poirot, Knives Out, Glass Onion, and the Sherlock Holmes movies with RDJ and even the BBC series. Tv-shows are also good too, like The Residence on Netflix and the french Lupin series. I\u2019ve even collected books of Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie. Basically any mystery, detective book with that old-school kinda vibe, very witty and interesting mysteries and characters. I do not care when the book was written (i love old school stories), but any with that style i mentioned by those movies ans books is something i need. If it is a book set in the morern era, I would still prefer if that book also has that kind of old school, witty charm.</p> <p>Mystery books read or currently reading: Agahtha Christie collection, Sherlo",

He doesn\u2019t just make drinks\u2014he studies the art, the history, and the soul of cocktail creation. For him, mixing is a ritual, not a routine.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for a classic cocktail book\u2014something iconic, even if outdated. Ideally, it would be from anywhere between the 1930s to the 1980s (or even older). This gift doesn\u2019t need to be trendy or modern. In fact, I\u2019m looking for something that reflects legacy and timeless craft\u2014the kind of book every true mixologist should proudly own, even just for inspiration, reverence, or study.</p> <p>I\u2019m more than happy to hunt for a vintage or used copy to preserve the charm. If there\u2019s a title you think no serious mixologist\u2019s shelf should be without, I\u2019d love to hear it.</p> <p>Thank you so much for your suggestions and time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

Maybe something that takes place at summer camp (although not necessary, just looking for something that feels like summer but also spooky lol)? Or just has an essence of summer/takes place in the summer? Summer nights.. swimming at the pool or at the lake.. bonfires.. hot weather...or that kind of weird rainy warm weather..you know very summer esque things but also spooky or scary..or a thriller of some kind. Maybe something with adventure? Idk.. </p> <p>I love the feeling of mind to late summer and into fall so anything that can capture any of that would be amazing! Bonus points if it&#39;s super atmospheric but not picky! Wouldn&#39;t mind if it takes place in early fall too when it still feels a bit like summer if you know what I mean.</p> <p>I love movies that have that vibe.
