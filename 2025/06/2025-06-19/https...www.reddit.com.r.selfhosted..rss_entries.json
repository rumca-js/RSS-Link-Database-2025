It integrates with Plex, Sonarr, Tautulli, and Overseerr to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally delete anything important. You can run it interactively or automate it (including with Docker).</p> <p>I originally wrote this program over a year ago when I finally had to migrate off the unlimited google storage and was unable to find a tool that did what I wanted. This one allows you to keep some of the TV show so that it will still show up in Plex searches. When combined with <a href=\"https://github.com/p-hueber/prefetcharr\">prefetcharr</a> it can be a really powerful tool to allow you to minimize the disk space used while still allowing a user to watch a whole show or season in a seamless manner.</p> <p>This is my 3rd iteration of this and was almost entirely vibe coded by Claude.
