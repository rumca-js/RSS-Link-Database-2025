But I think most people don't realize the true cause of the toxicity in these support forums.  It's not the well-meaning people there trying to give support that are at fault.  It's these parasitic creatures known as \"help vampires\".<br /><br />WANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? <br />\ud83d\udcb0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube <br />\ud83d\udcb3 Paypal: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=channel_banner&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazNocEhiaGFBT1l1MnRHbnlIcHFKbXJWVnpQd3xBQ3Jtc0tsLVZJc19YeFlwZ2JqbXVOa3g0Skw4TVhTV2otNm1tM3A1bUNnamh3S2V6OGQtLTBnSjBxYTlvUXMxeEVIS3o4US10NENHMUQ3STk2a01FOFBhUnZjZFctMEhFUTg1TVctQmFfVUdxZXJ4TDl0azlYNA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fwebscr%3Fcmd%3D_donations%26business%3Dderek%2540distrotube%252ecom%26lc%3DUS%26item_name%3DDistroTu",
