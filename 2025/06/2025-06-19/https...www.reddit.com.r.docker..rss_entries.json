And when that happened I lost communication to my docker machine. </p> <p>After some digging I realized that the docker just started using ip&#39;s in the 192.168.0.0/16 address space. When it did that, there were firewall rules created that blocked all subnets in that range. So that explains why I lost my connection. </p> <p>For the first time I am thankful for AI responses on search engines. I fixed my issue by creating the file /etc/docker/daemon.json with this single line and restarting the docker daemon:</p> <p><code> { &quot;default-address-pools&quot;: [ { &quot;base&quot;: &quot;172.16.0.0/12&quot;, &quot;size&quot;: 24 } ] } </code></p> <p>This reduced the default subnet sizes that docker uses from /16 range to /24 range. Considering the docker documnetation states that there is a limit to 1000 containers per network I&#39;m not sure why /22 isn&#39;t the default network size out",

Again that will pull it at build time, but when you publish the image to a registry, that <code>COPY --link</code> layer will actually pull the linked reference image (<em>full image weight I think, unless it&#39;s smart enough to resolve the individual layer digest to target?</em>). I&#39;ve used that feature in the past when copying over an anti-virus DB for ClamAV, which avoids each image at build/runtime needing to create the equivalent by pulling such from ClamAV&#39;s own servers, so that&#39;s an example of where it&#39;s beneficial.</p> <p>Anyway, I was curious if you could do something like:</p> <p><code>Dockerfile FROM some-massive-base-image COPY ./my-app /usr/local/bin/my-app </code></p> <p>Where the build shouldn&#39;t need to pull t",
