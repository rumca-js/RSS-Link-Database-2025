        "description": "Elden Ring Nightreign UPDATE - Everdark Sovereign Event (Adel Baron of Night)\nSo in case you missed it, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco ninja dropped an event for Nightreign that just came out a few hours ago called Everdark Sovereign. That is essentially a powered up version of one of the bosses from Elden Ring Nightreign, that has special rewards, its own vendor, and things like that. And it seems like from the post that they put out on the Bandai Namco website that they're going to have three bosses like one that runs this week, and the week after and the following week. So they're going to be limited like rotating between these 3 bosses and that some of the other bosses will be added at a later date.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Everdark Sovereign Event\n1:00 Adel, Baron of Night\n2:54 New Currency and Vendor\n4:21 New Relics\n14:49 Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to ",
