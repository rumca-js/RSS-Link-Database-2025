The civilization itself is also no joke as you&#39;re basically a living hive mind of flora and one of your unique traits is that you&#39;re a thriving mass of goop who has no need for individuality. Everything in your civilization is done by biological goop, and other races who you invade get eaten and turned into more goop. </p> <p>Kind of like a necromorph race with less flesh and more plant matter. </p> <p>Put in several dozen hours learning the game, had my fun burning the galaxy down as an evil space monster civilization, and now I&#39;ve got my fill. </p> <p>What else can I play to scratch my never ending itch to be a monster? I&#39;ve played the Total War: Warhammer games for the same reasons, Dead by Daylight, Evolve, Carrion, Man Eater, Vampyr, TES vampire play",
