The writing is so on point it feels like a perfect blend of nineties satire and 50s humor. The star of the show is the effects, costume and set design. </p> <p>Ebert says in his 2.5 star review: \u201cThis is a great-looking movie, a triumph of set design and special effects, creating a fantasy world halfway between suburbia and a prehistoric cartoon.

Very witty and not a single dull second in its 1hr43min run time. My eyes were glued to the back of the airplane seat.
