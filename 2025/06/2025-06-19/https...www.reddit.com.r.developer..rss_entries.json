It\u2019s a vertical tool combining scheduling, CRM, and payment workflows \u2014 all wrapped in a clean UI and nearly ready to go live.</p> <p>The app is about <strong>95% complete</strong>: user authentication, Stripe billing, user roles, dashboards, notifications, all functional. It also includes some built-in AI automation features like route forecasting, pricing suggestions, and dynamic invoice messaging using OpenAI APIs.</p> <p>There\u2019s real market interest \u2014 I\u2019ve spoken with operators in the space who are eager to use it and are currently cobbling together a solution manually.</p> <p>What I need now is a <strong>developer</strong> who can help address a few lingering bugs, improve some auth workflows ( thinking Clerk, but open to your ideas), and tighten up edge cases before we onboard real users. Working on getting verified by Twilio now as well for sending payme",

Most of my work has been web development with some full stack work using react, vue, and asp.net. After finishing my resume, I\u2019m confident I will get interviews\u2014 which is what is giving me the anxiety, as I\u2019m in my late 30s and haven\u2019t needed to interview for a position in YEARS. </p> <p>I know I am capable of doing the work, but I am worried about being asked to code in front of someone or be out on the spot then freezing or having my mind go blank. Can anyone tell me what it\u2019s like to apply for a senior developer or programmer position these days? Anything I should work on or practice specifically? </p> <p>Hopefully I\u2019m just over thinking this, but any insight or help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
