I myself prefer for magic to be, well, magical a bit of mystery, if I may say. In my writings, I give a basic layout of magic but keep things vague or unexplained beyond what a person needs to know. Yet it seems to be popular to give a very detailed view of how magic works in their world. Which is fine, but it feels like magic is losing that special thing. To me, magic should be unexplainable for the most part.

I normally write full-length fantasy stories, but on this occasion found myself between main projects and so decided to write something a little shorter (about 40k words) to tide myself over.</p> <p>Originally I envisioned it as a sort of modern telling of a classic-style fairytale.

It&#39;s a story about oppression, and the kind of fury that builds inside a person when they are forced to suffer under that oppression with no help in sight.
