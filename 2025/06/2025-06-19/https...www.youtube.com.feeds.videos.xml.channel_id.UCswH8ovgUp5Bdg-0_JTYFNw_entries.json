        "description": "Tucker Carlson has turned on Trump\u2014and the reason is war. In this Streamed episode, I dive into the growing split inside MAGA as Trump signals U.S. involvement in a war with Iran. This isn\u2019t what \u201cAmerica First\u201d was supposed to mean. Tucker calls it out, Bannon tries to spin it, and Trump fires back. With Candace Owens, MTG, and even Alex Jones piling in, I ask: is this a betrayal of the anti-war promise\u2014or just the mask slipping?\n\n[STREAMED]\n\nhttp://www.1775coffee.com/BRAND Get your 1775 Coffee starter kit worth $200 for only $99.

Post-COVID, post-trust in institutions, and in a time when the internet has exposed more than it\u2019s concealed, this hits very differently. What once felt fringe now feels prophetic. We\u2019ll be breaking down the claims, the context, and the uncomfortable parallels with the world we live in today.",
