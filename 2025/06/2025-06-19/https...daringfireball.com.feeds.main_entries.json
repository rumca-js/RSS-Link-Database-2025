Including, apparently, folks at the very top of\nthe Apple org chart.</p>\n\n<p>I talked to Gruber about the fallout from that post. Which is\npretty interesting! But there\u2019s a lot more going on in this\nconversation. It\u2019s partly about the friction Apple has been\ngenerating lately\u2009\u2014\u2009not just about its AI efforts, but the way it\nruns its App Store, and the way it interacts with developers\u2009\u2014\u2009and why all of that does and doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n\n<p>And it\u2019s also about the delightfully retro practice of running an\nad-supported blog in 2025. That works very well for Gruber, but it\nseems like the new Grubers of the world are doing their work on\nYouTube or Substack. He\u2019s got some thoughts about that, too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good interview, I thought\u2009",

A mandatory iPhone\nMirroring on Windows or an Android Mirroring on Mac may not be in\nhis plans. The other probability is the question of gatekeepers,\nraised in 2024.
