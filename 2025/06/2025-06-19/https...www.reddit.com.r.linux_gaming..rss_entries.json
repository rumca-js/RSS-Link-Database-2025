My idea was to dual boot my PC with Windows and Linux (using Debian as distro), so I could use Windows to play games and Linux to work/study and everyday use basically. I wanted to install Debian on my external ssd, which is also the one I use to download games (on windows), so my idea was to partition the SSD and install Debian in that partition. Does that make sense, or it&#39;s a complete waste of memory? Should I format the SSD and install Debian on the formatted SSD? Should I install it on my internal SSD where windows is installed?
