        "description": "Every query typed into a large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, requires energy and produces CO2 emissions. Emissions, however, depend on the model, the subject matter, and the user. Researchers have now compared 14 models and found that complex answers cause more emissions than simple answers, and that models that provide more accurate answers produce more emissions. Users can, however, to an extent, control the amount of CO2 emissions caused by AI by adjusting their personal use of the technology, the researchers said.",

        "description": "Researchers investigating the enigmatic and antibiotic-resistant Pandoraea bacteria have uncovered a surprising twist: these pathogens don't just pose risks they also produce powerful natural compounds. By studying a newly discovered gene cluster called pan, scientists identified two novel molecules Pandorabactin A and B that allow the bacteria to steal iron from their environment, giving them a survival edge in iron-poor places like the human body. These molecules also sabotage rival bacteria by starving them of iron, potentially reshaping microbial communities in diseases like cystic fibrosis.",

This giant thread, 10 times the mass of the Milky Way and stretching 23 million light-years, is one of the best confirmations yet of what cosmological simulations have long predicted: that vast, faint filaments connect the Universe s largest structures in a cosmic web.",
