For better or for worse, really. The studio marches to the beat of its own drum without a hint of self-consciousness, spinning weird tales about Satanic rites, the power of friendship, and the end of the world (localised to the city of Tokyo). Whether you're looking at the parent <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/shin-megami-tensei\">Shin Megami Tensei</a> series, the spin-off <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/persona\">Persona</a> games, or the<a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio\"> Metaphor</a>-shaped wunderkind that landed last year, Atlus always lands on its feet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/with-raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army-atlus-prove",

Rudimentary lighting, low-res textures and stiff animation afflicted these open-world efforts, while performance dropped below the 30fps target nearly constantly and image quality also suffered. Technically, they were a failure by any reasonable standard, even on the power-constrained OG Switch console. Now the <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company\">Switch 2</a> is here and these games have the potential to run significantly better - but what changes does the free Switch 2 upgrade Nintendo is offering actually deliver? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digi",
