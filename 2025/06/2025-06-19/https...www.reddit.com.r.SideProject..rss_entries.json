If they stick with it, they get their money back. If they fail the streak will reset or if they have set it they will lose thier money.</p> <p>It\u2019s based on the idea that financial accountability can boost follow-through and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve personally found helpful. Locking up the money I would have spent on what I want to quit for a time.</p> <p>Right now it\u2019s in a very early stage mostly focused on getting the flow and habit tracking smooth.</p> <p>Would really appreciate any input!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NIDGE11\"> /u/NIDGE11 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://habbet.vercel.app\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lexete/feedback_first_project/\">[comments",
