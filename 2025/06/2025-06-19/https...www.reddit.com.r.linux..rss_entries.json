But I got used to use Blender first up whenever I try (live test, no WM) a new distro and compare a lot of stuff : material (if it&#39;s a different PC), how much the distro use CPU/GPU/(V)RAM/FPS on start and so on. Then, I go to Blender and subdivide the default cube (it&#39;s laggy for some reason, so perfect for a stress test) and move the cursor/viewport/subdivided cube all around until it starts getting laggy with the real time rendering. I then look at how much triangles I&#39;m rendering in real time and how much has changed with the material usage (RAM/CPU/GPU/etc.) This is a stress test I do based on my feeling (Am I fine being this slow after calculating so much?). I know it&#39;s not a scientific looking benchmark with quantifiable numbers, but at least, it&#39;s quick and easy.</p> <p>By the way, if you find som",

After about a year of work, we created something truly usable and with features we\u2019re proud of. I\u2019ve been running it as my daily notification daemon since early on, so it\u2019s not just a prototype \u2014 it\u2019s solid and practical.</p> <p>But after pushing hard for so long, we hit a serious burnout a couple months ago. Since then, the project\u2019s been quiet \u2014 no new updates, no big release. We wanted to finish all the core features and release a 0.1 version with a big announcement, but that never happened.</p> <p>I\u2019m sharing this now because, even if I can\u2019t keep working on it, I want the community to know it exists. Maybe someone out there will find it useful, or maybe it\u2019ll inspire others to do something similar or even pick it up.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested, you can check it out here: <a href=\"https://github.com/not",
