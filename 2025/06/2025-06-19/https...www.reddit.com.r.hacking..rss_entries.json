Basically some friends and I are working on a video where the name of it is essentially a phone number, one of my friends thought it would be cool if we could set up a temporary hotline using the number from the video title and have it go straight to a voicemail of pre recorded promo material. Similar to when Tyler the Creator was promoting Call Me If You Get Lost through voicemails that\u2019d play when you called a number he would post. Any help is greatly appreciated </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Demi_toematoes\"> /u/Demi_toematoes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1lfdcty/temporary_hotline_for_promotional_material/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1lfdcty/temporary_hotline_for_promotional_material/\">[comments]</a></span>",
