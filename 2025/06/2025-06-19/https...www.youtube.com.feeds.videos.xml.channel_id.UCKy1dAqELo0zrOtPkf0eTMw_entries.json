        "description": "28 Years Later, reviewed by Tom Jorgensen.\n\n28 Years Later finds Danny Boyle and Alex Garland mining the last two decades of cultural strife to build a timely coming-of-age story full of beauty and brutality in equal measure. Newcomer Alfie Williams ably shoulders the harrowing plot, flanked on either side by similarly strong performances from Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Jodie Comer. Boyle has plenty of new tricks up his sleeves for how to shoot 28 Years Later in a way that evokes the spirit of the original without copying it, and the same goes for the action, which feels more like an evolution of 28 Days Later\u2019s self-assured perspective on infected carnage rather than an attempt to outdo the running, biting hordes of imitators it inspired.Its scope is much more narrow than 28 Days Later\u2019s, but its message is just as powerful.",

        "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2\u00a0reviewed by Tom Marks.\n\nThe Switch 2 is a Switch but bigger and better in nearly every way, with all of its successes and most of its faults accounted for. Its hybrid nature is still just as good of an idea today as it was eight years ago, and a lot of its best games benefit massively from the beefier tech inside it that allows for 4K, higher framerates, and faster load times. But all of that feels more like Nintendo getting back to treading water as the Switch started to fall a little too far behind what people expected from their games rather than providing a compelling reason of its own for you to pay 50% more for this upgrade. The new Joy-Con take an impressively creative swing at giving you that reason, but while its innovative mouse controls are a game-changer on paper, they\u2019re so ergonomically uncomfortable to use in practice that I can still feel the strain in my arm as I record this. The end result is a console I really like for all the same reasons I lo",

It\u2019s a kart racer that seems to nail the core idea of a good kart racer \u2013 fast and intense races, powerups that turn the tide and leave you salty, and a good vibe that celebrates the characters from its source material. We can\u2019t really ask for much more than that, yet there\u2019s still a lot to chew on that we haven\u2019t seen in previous Sonic racing games.  It\u2019s a vibe, and we look forward to drifting through when it launches on September 25 of this year on the last two PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo consoles, as well as PC. \n\nIGN's Summer of Gaming is presented by FX\u2019s Alien: Earth.
