Incredibly slow and dreamy, and ends with the kind of sentence that breaks your heart sideways.</p> <p>Engine Summer \u2013 John Crowley</p> <p>Shorter, sharper, and devastating. Post-apocalyptic mysticism and unreliable memory written in prose that glows.</p> <p>The Book of the New Sun \u2013 Gene Wolfe</p> <p>People call this \u201cthe literary Dark Souls.\u201d A dying earth, an unreliable narrator, metaphysics disguised as sword-and-planet sci-fi.

Without spoiling too much the story is basically about a professional theif who gets sent on a mysterious mission to a distant land in the company of a skilled but humorless female warrior. One of the most personality filled main characters I&#39;ve ever read in a book. The story told from his perspective, it quickly feels like an old friend telling you a story.

I mostly like action packed books with realism and a bit of romance. Also love grimmdark setting. Some series ive read and loved are: Mistborn, most of robin hobb, the empire of the vampire, red rising, bloodsworn and the faithful and the fallen by jhon gwynne, the painted man saga by petter v brett, Nevernight chronicle, the poppy war, six of crows and a few more. I loved the magic system made by snaderson in the mistborn trilogy and pretend to read the Stormlight archive soon.
