I\u2019m a software engineer with 12+ years in enterprise software dev, and I\u2019m diving into a new side project: building a commercially viable app from scratch using AI tools. I\u2019m documenting the journey in a blog series, and Part 1 just dropped, focusing on ideation. I\u2019m pretty skeptical of the AI hype, but tools like Grok are making development faster. In this post, I share how I used Grok to brainstorm app domains, landing on pet care (I own two chinchillas, so a natural choice). A key takeaway: AI can generate ideas quickly, but you still need to filter for feasibility and market fit. I ended up with 10 pet care challenges to explore next.

I recently launched a social app called <strong>Havoca</strong> that\u2019s built around one simple idea: sharing your life without filters, pressure, or fake perfection.</p> <p>The idea came from how exhausting Instagram and similar platforms can feel always performing, always editing, always pretending things are better than they are. With Havoca, you just post. Good days, bad days, messy days. No filters, no like counters, no algorithmic dopamine loops. Just raw, human stuff.</p> <p>I\u2019d love any feedback from fellow builders here. I\u2019m debating whether adding a messaging feature would boost user engagement or just distract from the simplicity.
