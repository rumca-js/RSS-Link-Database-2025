This is not running stable. After some time (~5min) the disk disconnects and is not longer recognized. This disk itself is ok, I checked it with smartmontools. The power should not be an issue. The disk requires 2W peak whilke the USB port should be able to deliver 6W. The disk runs stable when I connect it to one og the USB2 ports(but of course the speed is not sufficient for my application). So I assume it is a dynamic power issue: Voltage dropping in case of power spikes. </p> <p>Has anyone had a similar problem? What was your solution? Would it help to have one of these USB dual power cables, which connects to 2 ports on the Raspi? Should I put some big capacitors? Where?
