Now after years of bringing books to the beach, I have yet to read the books that sat in my tote. That being said, I am looking for book recommendations! I like crime, mystery, suspense, the supernatural, and yearning tales. Some books I have read most recently that I like are: My Year of Rest and Relaxation, The Bell Jar, and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. A book I read that I did not care for is Normal People-I just felt that it was cheesy, just my preference (I have a low tolerance for cheesiness). When I describe my favorite genre, it&#39;s &quot;high school English class required readings.&quot; Think The Great Gatsby or The Princess Bride. I don&#39;t read much and feel like I have a hard time getting into a book. I&#39;m looking for something to really pull the reader in from the start.

This may be self-explanatory, but for example, often times Doyle will be very descriptive of Sherlock Holmes or Watson making a drink, a tea, a type of tobacco, etc and put you in the place by mentioning the weather. </p> <p>Rather than just having a story be set somewhere, let\u2019s say Scotland and telling a story, the author incorporates the feel of the place by brining in mention of the rain, the cold, the warm tea, etc. I feel Charles Finch does a good job of this.</p> <p>I love authors who write amazing compelling books, but take care to truly wrap you in the culture and weather/landscape of the place as well.</p> <p>Bonus points if it\u2019s set in France, Ireland, or the UK and preferably nonfiction. </p> <p>Really lo",

I\u2019ve been reading a lot of books that lean towards mysteries where you know what happens at the beginning and you go back in time and get told the events - they\u2019re boring to me! I want to be scared! One of my favorite books is They Never Learn by Layne Fargo and that\u2019s the style I\u2019m really looking for. I love horror as well but I want something that keeps me on the edge of my seat rather than just being grossed out which I already have a lot of books on my TBR for. </p> <p>Here are some more books I\u2019ve enjoyed if that helps: Confessions Maeve Fly In My Dreams I Hold a Knife The Silent Patient</p> <p>thanks for your help!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/strawberry-cow02\"> /u/strawberry-cow02 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lijo5p/thriller_w_a_m",

I was born in early 1999 so the book would have had to be published in 1998 or earlier.

He is struggling a lot with anxiety about losing the people closest to him, despite no one being overtly sick or at risk of passing any time soon. I just learned the term \u2018anticipatory grief\u2019 and it describes what he has been experiencing so I\u2019d love to find some books I can share with him on this topic or just really anything helpful for what he\u2019s feeling. He also recently lost his father, though they had quite a strained relationship (open to books for this as well) so his anxiety/grief is really heightened right now.

It\u2019s a time travel story, but what really grabbed me is how it\u2019s not just about jumping through history\u2014it\u2019s more about the psychological weight of changing things you maybe shouldn\u2019t touch.</p> <p>The main character, Aris Thorn, is a historian who finds himself able to alter key moments in the past, but every change leads to unexpected, sometimes terrifying consequences. There\u2019s this creeping Lovecraftian vibe throughout the story that makes you feel like something much bigger (and darker) is lurking behind it all.</p> <p>So far, the pacing is a bit slow in parts but it actually works here\u2014it gives you time to sit with the tension and the moral questions the book raises.</p> <p>Just wondering, has anyone else read it? Does it keep up this level of tension all the way through? Not hyping it, but it\u2019s genuinely an interesting mix if you\u2019re into Stephen King\u2019s chara",

Normally I like light for vacation and I do think I want something easily digestible and smooth but does not need to be complete fluff. Of course I was thinking it would be cool to have things that felt the vibe of the trip or California. So far I have these flagged as options: </p> <p>One true loves - Taylor Jenkins Reid (already read Malibu rising which I realize is super Cali)</p> <p>Where the Forest Meets the Stars - nature magical vibes?? </p> <p>Book Lovers- light fiction </p> <p>My friends (Fredrik Backman)- not sure about this one but seems like it has summer vaca vibes just not sure if it\u2019s smooth enough of a read. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/grapefruit2886\"> /u/grapefruit2886 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestion",
