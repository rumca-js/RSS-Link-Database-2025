        "description": "In this live lecture from Omaha, Nebraska, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson weaves through biblical narratives and cultural critique\u2014from Tolstoy\u2019s suicidal despair to Moses\u2019 encounter with the burning bush, from Cain\u2019s failed sacrifice to James Bond as the symbol of romantic adventure. What do these stories have in common? What happens when we replace transcendent pursuit with technological pride or ideological dogma? This is a warning\u2014and a call\u2014to speak the truth, take up your cross, and climb.\n\nThis \u201cWe Who Wrestle With God\u201d tour stop was filmed in Omaha, NE, on October 21st, 2024.\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
