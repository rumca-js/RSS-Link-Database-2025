I have been lurking on this sub for quite sometime and I am sorry if this post does not align with the purpose of this sub but I need some options.

To avoid doxxing I can&#39;t share Github link directly here but I can share them in DMs. They include : 1) Kafka like distributed publish subscribe system in Java 2) GUI based DSA simulator in Python and PyQt and, 3) Vulkan based video shader in C++ (to which I am currently exploring adding object detection via YOLO). </p> <p>The advice is to look around the software you use and get into them.

And over the time I have seen that there is no such CLI package/tool which can help you kickstart your go project. There is alot of repetitive task of creating the project folder structure downloading the dependences and more. So to make Gophers&#39; task easier I built a CLI tool that helps you in generating Go folder structure, download required packages and setup projects based on different template like api server, cli app. You can easily feed it a config yaml file or input via flags and it will configure a scaffold of your preferred type of project. It has lot of starter configurations like db setup for web service, docker, magefile and many more. Check out the package in Go official package repository.</p> <p>Will appreciate your feedback and also I am looking for contributors to scale this package, for contributing checkout the CONTRIBUTING.md in the github repo: <a",
