The <strong>Live Server VS Code extension</strong>, which has been downloaded over <strong>65 million times</strong>, still has a critical local file disclosure vulnerability that I reported five years ago. Despite assurances from the creator,@dey_ritwick, that it would be fixed, the issue persists.</p> <p>This vulnerability allows attackers to access local files, posing a significant risk to users&#39; data security. Given the widespread use of this extension, the potential impact is enormous. I believe this situation highlights the importance of timely security updates and the responsibility of developers to address such issues promptly.I&#39;ve shared this information on X (formerly Twitter) and would appreciate it if you could help spread the word.
