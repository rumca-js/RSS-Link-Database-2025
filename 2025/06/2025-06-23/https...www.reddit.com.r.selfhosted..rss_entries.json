It\u2019s self-hosted and can be removed anytime, installed apps will stay and work. </p> <p>Since the first announcement I tested it and prioritised features that seemed important. So I added the following:</p> <ul> <li>Cloudflare tunnels to expose installed apps to the Internet, so that they\u2019re available to you from everywhere. You\u2019ll need a domain and a cloudflare account.</li> <li>Database support. If an app needs a specific db, this db will be created. Credentials are created separately for each app so they don\u2019t interfere. Supported DBs: mysql+panel, postgresql+panel, redis. Redis is being created as a separate instance for each app as per their guidelines.</li> <li>Database selection. Some apps have an option which db to use, so I supported this in the UI.",
