        "description": "I like using the GreatStuff XL gun and Pro Series adhesive for full panels. The forked guide is very helpful at keeping the adhesive centered on joists. For repair projects, I use the small can with the Smart Dispenser. Construction adhesive reduces squeaking and strengthens the fastener application. Many thanks to GreatStuff for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25",
