Through advanced omics-based experiments and comparative histological analyses, they found that hypertrophied lips of cichlids had a larger proteoglycan-rich layer. This study provides vital insights into the evolutionary biology of lip hypertrophy in cichlids of the East African Great Lakes.",

Furthermore, localized photo-switching within a DNA liquid condensate generated two distinct directional motions.

While researchers often warn that a lack of standardized protocols risks muddying the waters, this research shows that public involvement could be key to plugging the data gaps and that comparability rather than conformity is key.",
