So this morning, I decided to play Sonic 1 on Genesis and I beat it in a bit over an hour; by the time I finished the game, I had all six Chaos Emeralds (granted, I got the last one on Star Light Zone Act 2), 14 lives, and two Continues, without getting a single Game Over the entire time. I also managed to beat the Labyrinth Zone boss (which I traditionally struggled with) in one go, without trouble.</p> <p>Now I&#39;ve been playing the Genesis-era mainline Sonic games since I was 10 (I&#39;m 24 now), so I might not be the best person to judge their difficulty, but I have heard people say that the Sonic games are a bit easier than many games of their time period. With that said, would you all say that Sonic 1, 2, CD, and 3+Knuckles are noticeably easier, harder, or about the same to other platformers of their time (which I",

Basically, if you say game A is 4x more fun than game B, but game B uses 12x less processing power, then B is 3x better than A. Or, in other words, score = (fun score) / (cpu ops per second required). I purposefully didn&#39;t say &quot;flops&quot; because let&#39;s face it, the games that win will probably not even have floating point available to them.</p> <p>Anyways, since there are so many variables and matters of taste involved, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the heated debates!

Just want it to run the games well. Not really interested in ps1 or higher more demanding games, already have other options for that. If its customizable better since I have a lot of roms stored already. I already have a r36 if that matters. any good for the $ deal. not really wanting to spend over $100 on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/2112ricky\"> /u/2112ricky </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1liq0cu/consile_recommendation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/",

It was a round wheel, but you were able to click the top-middle section in and out to change it into a more F1 style racing wheel. What the real special thing was, was that you were also able to pull and twist the left and right part of the wheel, turning it into a motorcycle steer. Was available on the dutch market somewhere in the mid-to-end 90&#39;s (I believe I got it from Kijkshop), not sure about other markets. It&#39;s not the Konix Multisystem, although I does slightly look like it.</p> <p>Anyone who had something like this or has any idea what I&#39;m talking about?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comfortable-Rub-1678\">",

However, I am having a real difficult time. It may just end up being a Mandella effect so I am hoping you all may be able to help me.</p> <p>It was a 2D side scrolling run n&#39; gun in the spirit of Contra but I am almost certain it wasn&#39;t any of the Contra titles. 2 players, guns, I think the setting was kind of jungle-like, I remember it being relatively bloody as well. I think it was a 2 word title like &quot;Elite Commandos&quot; or something like that, I don&#39;t recall it being very popular and was almost just a knock off kind of game. All signs point to the Contra series but I don&#39;t ever recall ever playing Contra as a kid. Could be false memories though.
