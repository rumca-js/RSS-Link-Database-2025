        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, President Trump launches an attack on Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday night. The next day, he mentions the possibility of regime change in Iran. I\u2019ve made my stance on US interventionism in the Middle East known. Will I change my position now to keep up with the trends? No, obviously not. I\u2019ll give my full take and breakdown of the situation today. Also, Democrats have more important things to worry about. Like the fact that JD Vance called a Democrat lawmaker \u201cJos\u00e9.\u201d And the good folks in Canada are always happy to lighten the mood by giving us something to laugh at. They\u2019ve done it again. Now they\u2019re changing their street signs to make them completely unintelligible, all in the name of decolonization. \n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:34 Opening\n02:34 - 26:33 Trump Bombed Iran.
