Prime Day will return on July 8 to July 11 this year, marking the first time the shopping event has been more than 48-hours long. That just means you\u2019ll have more time to shop the deals, but really, you don't even have to wait until the official start date to save. Amazon typically always has early Prime Day deals in the lead-up to the event, and this year we\u2019re already seeing some solid discounts on gadgets we like. Here, we\u2019ve gathered all of the best Prime Day deals you can get right now, and we\u2019ll keep updating this post as we get close to Prime Day proper.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-prime-day-deals-early-deals-to-shop-now\">Prime Day deals: Early deals to shop now</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-prime-day-deals-under-50\">Prime Day deals under $50</h3> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"5236ed3ac70c40639858691e9e13a328\" da",
