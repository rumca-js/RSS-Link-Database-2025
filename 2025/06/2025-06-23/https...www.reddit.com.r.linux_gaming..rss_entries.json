Both aren&#39;t immutable I know there is difference in packages, but what exactly. Would it be achievable to get same performance installing these? I guess yes, but the catch is to know what to install. Does anyone use clean Fedora for gaming? I know there is no Proton/Wine pre-installed, but this I think can be easily managed using Proton-QT and Winetricks, not mentioning Steam, to get these translating layers.</p> <p>I guess updating MESA is also something to take care about when running clean OS like that.

That being said, I think my Geforce 1660 Super is starting to show its age a bit and given my budget is a bit limited im looking at mid range options to replace it (planning on keeping my Ryzen 5 3600 for the immediate future and looking for a potentially a second hand upgrade). </p> <p>Doing some research it looks like right now midrange cards are hamstrung by Nvidia and AMD limiting them to 8GB of VRAM, which a lot of people are saying isn&#39;t going to be very future proofed. Ive been interested in the Intel ARC B580 or A770 as alternative options which don&#39;t have this limitation but I&#39;ve seen mixed comments about the state of their linux drivers and Vulkan performance.</p> <p>Anyone on here using Intel cards on Linux able to offer their perspective?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
