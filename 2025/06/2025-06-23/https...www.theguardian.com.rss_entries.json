The cast is full of delightful surprises. Rose Bryne is a stiletto-clad Oxford-educated villainess with quips so brutal that she makes Regina George look like Barney.

I do this with a heavy heart: one of the pleasures of this book is the jaw\u2011dropping coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre that comes halfway through. Until that point, Endling offers its readers the pleasures of a more or less conventional novel.</p><p>The central character is a misanthropic obsessive called Yeva who drives a converted campervan around the countryside of her native Ukraine, rescuing endangered snails. She\u2019s hoping to get them to breed, but some turn out to be endlings \u2013 the last living member of a species. First coined in the 1990s, the word was unknown to me before I read this book, but the tragic biological checkmate it describes is older than history.

Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong><strong><br></strong>Julian Fellowes\u2019s New York-set costume drama continues to underwhelm in its third series. Somehow, it\u2019s never quite racy or absorbing enough to excuse its lack of literary weight, plus some of the dialogue feels like a parody of period potboiler tropes. Ada (Cynthia Nixon) has become heavily involved in the temperance movement \u2013 which isn\u2019t suiting Agnes (Christine Baranski) at all. Elsewhere, George\u2019s railroad plan is in danger of hitting the buffers. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/23/tv-tonight-the-gilded-age-third-season\">Continue reading...</a>",
