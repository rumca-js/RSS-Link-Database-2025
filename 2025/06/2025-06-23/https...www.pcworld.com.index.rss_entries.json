The Baseus Enercore 3-in-1 wall charger has only just been launched and it\u2019s already <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6T325LW\">down to $50 ahead of Prime Day</a>, which is quite a discount from its $70 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what makes this wall plug awesome? Well, it comes with a built-in retractable USB-C cable. Yep, you read that right. This charger has its own cable so you don\u2019t absolutely need one unless you want to charge multiple devices at once. It\u2019s not a short, tiny cable; it\u2019s a decent 2.6-foot-long one, which gives you enough room for movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s called a 3-in-1 charger because, in addition to the built-in cable, it also has two Type-C ports. The Baseus Enercore delivers up to 67W fast charging, which is impressive because",
