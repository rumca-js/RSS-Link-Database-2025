Template setup is one click and one <code>pdm setup</code> command to setup locally, after that only <code>src</code>, <code>tests</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code> should be of your concern. I&#39;ll let you be the judge of the above and below though.</p> <blockquote> <p>GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate\">https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Feedback, questions, ideas, all are welcome, either here or on the GitHu",

I also understand that Google has its hands in slightly more within the technology industry so it could be tough to compare.
