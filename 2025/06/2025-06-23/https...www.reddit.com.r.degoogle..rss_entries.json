It&#39;s OK, but it&#39;s not one focusing on UI/UX. They focus on privacy bit so much that they usually choose to go with their own ways to implement stuffs. For example their iOS app has entire documentation about how and why they don&#39;t even trust the iOS-native storages.</p> <p>Besides, there is HeyEmail which offers cool UI/UX redesigning the entire email workflow in pretty opinionated way. But they say they do have ability to actually read the email content and don&#39;t support PGP.</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard that privacy is all about personal preference between privacy and usability.
