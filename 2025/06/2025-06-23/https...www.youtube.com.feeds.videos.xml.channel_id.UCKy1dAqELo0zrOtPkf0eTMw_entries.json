Join us as we dive into all the spoilery details of 28 Years Later.\nAfter Spike (Alfie Williams) has to say goodbye to his mother, who doctor Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) consensually euthanizes after diagnosing her with cancer, he returns a newborn baby recovered from an infected mother (the baby is uninfected because of the way the placenta works) to his island village. He also leaves a note for his father Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), where he explains that he\u2019s going to keep exploring the mainland and may return home someday.\nBut when he\u2019s pursued by a larger group, Spike is saved by a group led by a man named Jimmy (Sinners\u2019 Jack O\u2019Connell), an older version of the only child to survive the film\u2019s grisly prologue.
