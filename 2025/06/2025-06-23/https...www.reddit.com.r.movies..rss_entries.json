It&#39;s even juicier if they have a close relationship with someone who would be horrified if they found out the truth about them. Examples are things like:</p> <ul> <li><p>Female character disguised as a man in historic setting </p></li> <li><p>Black character disguised as white in 1960s USA (or other racist society)</p></li> <li><p>Exorcist who is secretly a demon </p></li> <li><p>Cop who doesn&#39;t realise that the criminal/vigilante they&#39;re chasing is actually their relative/lover </p></li> <li><p>Werewolf/alien whose close friend/lover/relative is a werewolf/alien hunter</p></li> <li><p>A character who has to hide supernatural abilities that make them incredibly dangerous and threatening to society, whether they intend to be or not.</p></li>",
