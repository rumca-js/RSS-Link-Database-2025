The idea is to make a VR space with decorations and photos and some greeting where she can spend a good 5-10 minutes looking around and exploring. Maybe overlay it on our existing living room or something or just create a new smaller space. Anything is on the table and I\u2019m looking for inspiration and some advice on how to achieve it.</p> <p>So far, best idea I could find is using Gravity Sketch but would love to hear any ideas or suggestions \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/membr_\"> /u/membr_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1li7bqi/vr_birthday_card_quest_2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1li7bqi/vr_birthday_card_quest_2/\">[comments]</a></span>",
