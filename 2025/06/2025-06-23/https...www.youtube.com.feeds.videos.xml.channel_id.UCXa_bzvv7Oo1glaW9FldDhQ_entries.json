        "description": "Death Stranding 2 is definitely an impressive piece of technology; it feels like a complete package. Kojima Productions has made great use of current-gen technology, not just in the graphics department but also the 3D audio to deliver something that feels like the fully realized vision of Death Stranding. \n\nIt definitely shares the same DNA as its predecessor, but the incremental upgrades in each aspect do build up to create a significant improvement in the final product.",

        "description": "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach takes the unique foundation of its first game and builds on it confidently and smartly, coming across as a more diverse, engaging, and mechanically interesting gameplay experience. \n\nNarratively, the game has a lot of interesting things to say, even if it can be a bit too heavy-handed and clunky at times- which, to be frank, is almost to be expected with Hideo Kojima games. I expect that Death Stranding 2 is still going to be a divisive experience, even if it isn't quite as divisive as the first game was, because at its core, this is still definitely more Death Stranding- but it's not just more, it's also better, more confident, and better designed.",
