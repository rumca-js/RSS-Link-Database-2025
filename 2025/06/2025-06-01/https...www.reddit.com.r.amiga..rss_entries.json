What would computers look like today?</p> <p>Just trying to imagine how things would have played out - I ended up coming to the conclusion that things really wouldn&#39;t have been all that different in the end. The amiga would end up looking very much like a modern pc - just with slashes going the opposite direction in filenames.</p> <p>Very early on the Amiga would have had to get fully retagretable graphics, the blitter would have morphed into something pretty similar to todays GPUs. There would have been a pretty painful transition in the 90s as security features got retro-fitted into the OS - which I imagine would probably have become a kind of sandbox environment with an MMU not too dissimilar to modern linux or window",
