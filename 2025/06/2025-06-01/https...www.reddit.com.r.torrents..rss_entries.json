These aren\u2019t super popular, but not unknown either. Just not mainstream.</p> <p>When I try to download such films, I often can\u2019t find any proper torrents. And even when I do, there are no subtitles, or just one raw .mkv file with nothing else. So I was wondering, is this a common problem? Or is it just that some movies are really hard to find even today?</p> <p>Like, I know back in the day before OTTs or fast internet, it was hard to access world cinema. Now we do get access to a lot of well-known films now. But when it comes to these lesser-known ones, maybe the access issue still hasn\u2019t been solved?</p> <p>I\u2019m okay if there\u2019s no solution, I just wanted to k",
