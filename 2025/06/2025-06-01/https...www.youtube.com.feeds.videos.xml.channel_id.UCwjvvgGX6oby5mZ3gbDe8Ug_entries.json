Molested and drugged in elite kindergartens, while CCP censors rush to bury the truth.\n\nWe break down everything\u2014from the RYB Kindergarten scandal to China\u2019s live organ harvesting system\u2014and expose how the state treats children as tools, not lives.\n\nThis isn't dystopian fiction. This is the CCP\u2019s version of childhood.\nSubscribe for more hard-hitting truth they don\u2019t want you to see.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Watch till the end. It gets darker than you think.\n\n#China #ChildrensDay #CCPExposed #RYBScandal #ChineseEducation #HumanRights #CommunismKills #Melamine #VaccineScandal\n\nhttps://www.upholdjustice.org/node/647\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BoLdeO2dP8c?si=ST6YSn8EHbo5cVXg",
