One of the early mantras as I moved into appsec was that SWEs don&#39;t care about security, they just want to get features out the door. As I progressed in my appsec career I noticed that most of the engineering teams did indeed care about security and often had a better relationship with how to integrate it into the software compared to the appsec team.</p> <p>Going through a write-up by Gartner (from Nov 2024) this morning and they are still bringing out the same old &quot;engineers only care about features, not security&quot;.</p> <p>My question is: is this what others are seeing in this space?
