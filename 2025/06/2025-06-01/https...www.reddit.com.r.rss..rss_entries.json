I talked to a few friends, and they told me they also struggle with all these emails, so I thought: maybe it\u2019s worth asking a larger community.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to understand how people deal with this flood of newsletters: do they filter them? Do they use apps to manage them? Do some people just ignore them or actually love them?</p> <p>I\u2019ve put together a very short survey (less than 2 minutes) to gather some insights.</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could help me out!</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7",
