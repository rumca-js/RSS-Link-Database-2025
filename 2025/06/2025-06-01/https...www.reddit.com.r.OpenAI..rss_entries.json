According to the authors, this is a massive improvement over reinforcement learning as AZ will no longer be restricted by the amount and quality of human data it can train off of and would thus, in theory, be able to grow far more intelligent and capable than humans. I previously dismissed fears of AI apocalypse due to the fact that AI&#39;s training off of human data could only get as intelligent as its training data is and would eventually plateau when they reached human intellectual capacity. In other words, AI&#39;s could have superhuman intellectual width and be an expert in every human intellectual domain (which no human would have the time and energy to do) but it would never be able to know more than the smartest individuals in any given domain ",

Many, many times GPT silently declines to read a PDF or code excerpt, not even particularly large ones. It responds with this theatre of ambiguity, which at first glance seems competent until you realize there&#39;s no specificity. It&#39;s like a masterclass in bullshitting. </p> <p>This includes when integrating with VScode via the macOS application: it was writing edits without reading the code. I tested it, and would say to the effect </p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;before making changes, just read through the file. I added something silly in there, can you tell me where it is?&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>and like on line 300 I add an excerpt of dialogue from <em>My Dinner With Andre</em>. GPT replies &quot;Oh that&#39;s sharp. Anyway...&quot; When pressed, it&#39;s got empty pockets. </p> <p>Anyway, yeah, it&#39;s a much less honest and useful of an experience. ",
