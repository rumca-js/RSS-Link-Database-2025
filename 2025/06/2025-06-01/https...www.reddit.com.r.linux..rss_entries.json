It was completely random, I could run stress tests for an hour and the laptop would have no issues. Yet sometimes it would shutdown 5 minutes after starting up. Other times it would do it in the middle of heavy tasks. I refreshed drivers, removed the battery, changed the battery, factory reset Windows, and nothing worked. Finally, I decided to try downloading Linux Mint and get rid of Windows. That fixed it. I&#39;ve been using it for days with no shutdowns, I even ran a Minecraft server overnight.
