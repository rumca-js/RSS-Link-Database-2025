You have your ships at the bottom of the screen, and the turn begins with time moving forward a few seconds (just like in Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock, but from much earlier). Your ships are nothing more than shapes (triangles and rectangles and such). You can choose direction (forward, turn at a chosen angle, or boost) and weapons (some shoot straight, some track enemies).
