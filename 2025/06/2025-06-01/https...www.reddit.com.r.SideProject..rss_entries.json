One thing I don\u2019t like about pomodoro and similar timers is that they run somewhere on your phone or a separate tab and you need to distract yourself to go and check it (e.g. how much time has passed). So I built a simple free website where you can start pomodoro sessions or focused tasks and get the sticky popup widget that\u2019ll follow you no matter what window you\u2019re at (note: for chrome on desktop). So you can easily see how the time goes and pause/restart/take a break without breaking your workflow </p> </di",

It could be also a mix of features like project management, voice memos and cloud storage. If I think about me and my band, I mostly struggle with keeping my song ideas orginized (I use voice memos) and have a platform where upload rehearsals and add timestamps, comments, etc.</p> <p>Even a simple wish or idea helps a lot.

It all happens in real time, based on your choices.</p> <p>It\u2019s not really a game in the usual sense. There\u2019s no right answer, no linear path. Just\u2026 storytelling, where your imagination leads and the system keeps up.</p> <p>We\u2019re calling it <strong>Dream Novel</strong>. Still early days, but long-term we\u2019re hoping it becomes something much bigger: a full-on narrative RPG platform where people can make their own stuff, mod it, build worlds, share stories, all that good stuff.</p> <p>Right now though, we just want to get it in front of folks who love storytelling, visual novels",

The quicker you go and the fewer amount of guesses you make, the more points you earn.</p> <p>At the end of the month, cash prizes will be distributed to the top players who performed the best against the AI. For June I&#39;m starting off with $200, which might not seem like much but I&#39;m definitely losing money on this. The revenue from the app will go back into the cash prizes for future months, hopefully getting larger as the months go on!</p> <p>There are a lot of future updates I have in mind but I wanted to get this out there to start!</p> <p>I would appreciate any constructive feedback you have!
