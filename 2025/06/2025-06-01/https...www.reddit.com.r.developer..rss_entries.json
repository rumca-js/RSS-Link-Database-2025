Since, I am from a tier-3 engineering college and based on current jobs scenario, companies are only paying 3-4 lpa package for tech roles, and that also after 6-9 months of internship period with 10-15K stripend. I am not good in coding and DSA. wasted my 4 years but I have a sales offer almost double the package these tech start ups are proving, it&#39;s a well known electrical company. I am planning that may be I should join this sales role and grind for 2 years giving my best shot at every task and side by side prepare for CAT and then eventually crack CAT and join a top B- school to increase my package and switch to consulting.</p> <p>Is this a good plan, should I join sales Or if not what should I do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

I am in a small startup, I have done a lot of different stuff because we do not have enough people for dedicated positions. Currently, I feel with a great control over the technologies I use (mostly Vue for front-end, node.js/python backend), and I can see a huge improvement over the years on my coding practices and decision making. The last couple of years I\u2019ve been in charge of projects, taking care of the strategic part, shaping the architecture, and recently learning cloud and devops. I have a great confidence on my project, but I don\u2019t have anyone else around with more experience that can tell me if I am doing things correctly. I come here to ask about what should be my focus to not get stuck, to keep improving and be a terrific dev in the future. Any help is welcomed :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/javiermuinelo\"> /u/javier",
