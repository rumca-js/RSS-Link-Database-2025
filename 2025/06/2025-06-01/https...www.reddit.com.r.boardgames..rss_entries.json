And sure, setting up a game isn&#39;t the most exciting thing in the world, but I&#39;ve recently realized that, when it&#39;s not an exaggerated setup, I enjoy it.</p> <p>I find that setting a game up often puts me in the mood to play it. It&#39;s almost like a pre-game ritual. It helps me to remember some aspects of the game that I&#39;ve forgotten, since it&#39;s been a while since my last play.

Not that I dislike BGA, I love it especially because I can&#39;t play with my friends as much as I&#39;d like. But not because of the setup time.</p> <p>I think w",

And the game should not contain too many pieces that can be lost and be relatively resilient to damage, but I have to add that I do sleeve my cards. Last year I chose Coup, High Society, Palm Island and One Night Ultimate Werewolf. Everyone loved it. This year I&#39;m thinking Deep Sea Adventure (as it can be set up in between your plates while waiting for dinner at the restaurant) and Lovecraft Letter, 5 Towers and Castle Combo, but I&#39;m really not happy with the latter 3 and would like to find some alternatives.

While it seems there isn&#39;t much variety to them, the maps can be arranged in many creative ways to create delves, dungeons, and clashes you will encounter throughout your adventure.</p> <p>The main story takes place after the fall of Tamriel&#39;s Second Empire.
