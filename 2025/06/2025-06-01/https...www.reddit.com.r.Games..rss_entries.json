Players select a leader with a unique deck, relic, and resources, then navigate a map where each path consumes a limited currency\u2014days. Running out of days means game over.</p> <p>At the end of each path, engage in combat by constructing villages through card play. Cards cost gems and may require resource conversions. Accumulating resources generates energy each turn, which can be used to destroy enemy towers or the main enemy structure. Completing combats rewards you with new cards, relics, and gold, allowing progression to the next map.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> June 2, 2025<br/> <strong>Platform:</strong> PC (Steam)<br/> <strong>Steam Page:</strong> <a href=\"htt",
