I&#39;ve had a slight amount of trouble setting it up, but I often have trouble with doing tech like that. I managed to get VRChat running on it with relative ease. It kicked me out a few times while I was trying to load into a world, but it genuinely didn&#39;t take much time. I had the Oculus Quest 1 for years, but I&#39;ve stopped using it ever since it lost support. I wanted to get a headset from someone other than Meta because I didn&#39;t want to buy from a company that presents so much built-in obsolescence. I also had several issues with the Quest in terms of casting it to my phone and my TV. It was very inconsistent and confusing. The window to return the Elite is about to end and I want to know if my new headset is significantly worse than what&#39;s available on the market or if it&#39;s just a little bit janky.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",

Interacting with your guns is similar, with different buttons and triggers required to handle your gun or eject ammo. One game you jump and duck with a joystick, the next game you&#39;re using buttons. Some games have you press a specific button for menus. </p> <p>Does any of this disappoint anybody, or is it just par for the course? Does it affect how you play games? Are you more or less hesitant to play a variety of games with different control schemes to have to remember? Do you try to complete games before playing a new one, due to having to learn a slightly altered control setup? Do you have trouble replaying older games, or even avoid playing games you haven&#39;t completed, simply because you would have to relearn the controls?</p> </",

Climbing, grabbing, throwing, catching \u2013 all of that feels solid and intuitive. You can dismantle enemies by shooting off limbs, physically pull yourself along ledges, even catch objects mid-air with gravity gloves and throw them back.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into games like Boneworks and enjoy physically interacting with the environment, there\u2019s definitely something here to like.</p> <h1>Mixed Bag: Controls and UI</h1> <p>The control scheme is fine overall, although a few things need refinement.
