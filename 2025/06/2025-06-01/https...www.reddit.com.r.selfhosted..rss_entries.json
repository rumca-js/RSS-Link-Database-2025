Readarr does not support this without running two separate instances of Readarr.</p> <p>Also, the author-based interface feels like overkill when I just want to search for specific books. Since I understand Readarr it&#39;s workable, but I wanted something simple enough that I could share with less savvy friends and family.</p> <h2>What BookGrab does:</h2> <ul> <li>Provides a clean, simple search interface for MAM&#39;s book collection</li> <li>Shows results with all the important details (title, author, format, etc",

Is there a SATA hat for a Raspberry Pi 3B+ for this kind of scenario?</p> <p>Or is my only option to get one of those toaster looking devices from Sabrent or something for Amazon to handle the two hard drives via USB?</p> <p>Figured I would ask here since I plan on self hosting a ton more stuff with the Pi. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

NPM seems to need API acces to the DNS provider, which mine doesn&#39;t offer. So acme-dns seems to solve that problem. Unfortunately i was unsuccessful to get it running. Surprisingly i have not found a single tutorial for NPM. I&#39;ve found other setups which guided me through the manual process of registing with acme. I got a json with domain, password etc. I created the required cname record. I added the json to NPM data dir. Still no luck. Error shows that it (certbot?) is unable to find any match for my domain inside the json. Why should it he there?? Shouldn&#39;t it be only the json response from the registration??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
