I use a dGPU too, a GTX 1650 which is pretty weak for today&#39;s times but serves me well, however the situation of NVIDIA drivers on Linux is still not very good and the games ran well at first but as I played the FPS started to drop, probably because of the lack of shared memory for NVIDIA GPUs. That said, I went to test the GPU offrender on Linux to see how it was currently, I hadn&#39;t used it since 2019 and to my surprise it is much easier to use and much more functional. From what I&#39;ve seen, GPU offrendering is rarely talked about here, so I wanted to talk about it because my 1650 is running games better than ever since all the VRAM and processing of the dGPU is just for the game and I can",

To fix that on Windows you would either have to play in a window or install some script to launch on startup. Minecraft Bedrock Launcher just doesn&#39;t have this issue, and also has a built-in FPS counter. Community fixes broken games once again. I also can freely browse game&#39;s data.</p> <p>Thanks MCMrARM, ChristopherHX, GameParrot and other Bedrock Launcher contributors \ud83e\udef6</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Damglador\"> /u/Damglador </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1l0v4r1/minecraft_bedrock_launcher_provides_a_better/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1l0v4r1/minecraft_bedrock_launcher_provides_a_better/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Like the other person, I&#39;m considering switching to Linux, but I&#39;m passionate about video games. I was therefore wondering whether compatibility issues still exist or if the situation has improved. If so, which distro of Linux would you suggest switching to?</p> <p>P.S.</p> <p>In the answers to other posts, I saw someone mention <a href=\"https://www.protondb.com\">ProtonDB</a>.
