Every time I start it I think &quot;wow, I was hard on this movie before, it&#39;s pretty good.&quot; The first confrontation with the Black Rider and meeting Strider at the prancing pony are real standout moments -- so good that Peter Jackson borrowed them for his version. </p> <p>But around the end of the counsel of Elrond the movie starts to feel like it&#39;s running out of gas, and it&#39;s dragged down more and more until by the time it gets to the Balrog the movie just feels completely exhausted (and the viewer too). I&#39;ve seen clips from Helms Deep at the end and I think I&#39;ve made the right decision only watching the first 2/3 and stopping.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/0rbitaldonkey\"> /u/0rbitaldonkey </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l121mu/whats_a_movie_youve_tried_several_times_but_never/\">",

Throughout the entire story, it keeps its focus firmly on the exploration of its characters, and it devotes just as much time to their internal struggles as it does to their external ones. Ultimately, it&#39;s a story about what war does to the human soul, and the way that it acts as a catalyst for people to face horror, pettiness, and the harsh realities of their own existence.</p> <p>",
