Self-driving cars are a thing now, and there are programs out there writing articles, making art, even helping doctors diagnose patients. My buddy who\u2019s a paralegal is freaking out because AI can scan contracts faster than he can even read them. It\u2019s like, no job feels totally safe anymore, you know?</p> <p>So here\u2019s where my head\u2019s at: if AI keeps eating up these jobs, what happens to all the people who used to do them? It\u2019s not just about losing a paycheck, though that\u2019s rough enough. Work gives a lot of us a sense of purpose, like it\u2019s part of who we are. Without it, things could get messy fast.

Regarding AI becoming self-aware, i do not se it as possible. We must first define what self-aware means, it means to think autonomously on your own. AI models are programmed to process various inputs, often the input goes through various layers and is multimodal and AI model obviously decides the pathway and allocation, but even this process has been explicitly programmed into it. The simple process of when to engage in a certain task or allocation too has been designed. ofThere are so many videos of people freaking out over AI ",

Well guess what \u2013 it&#39;s all AI generated, and the people fall for it. You can&#39;t even tell them that it&#39;s not real because they don&#39;t believe it. Check it out: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/kCSd61hIVE8?si=V-GcA7l0wsBlR3-H\">https://youtube.com/shorts/kCSd61hIVE8?si=V-GcA7l0wsBlR3-H</a></p> <p>I reported the video to YouTube because it&#39;s misleading, but I doubt that they&#39;ll do anything about it. I honestly don&#39;t understand why Google would hurt themselves by making an AI model this powerful. People will flood their own platforms with this AI slop, and banning single channels will not solve the issue.</p> <p>At this point we can just hope for a law that makes it an obligation to mark AI generated videos.

In other words, as an example, if I ask AI search to generate three stocks to buy, is it simply identifying what most analysts are saying to buy, or does it scan a bunch of stocks, figure out a list of ones to buy, and then whittle that down to three based on its own pseudo-instinct (which arguably is what humans do; if it is totally mechanically screening, I&#39;m not sure we can call that thinking since there is no instinct)?</li> <li>If AI is to really learn to write books and screenplays, can it do so if it cannot walk? Let me explain: I would be willing to bet everyone reading this has had the following experience: You&#39;ve got a problem, you solve it after thinking about it on a walk.

When I log into the main consumer site at <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/app\">https://gemini.google.com/app</a>, I see two model options: 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash. (Just to clarify\u2014I&#39;m NOT talking about AI Studio at aistudio.google.com, but the regular Gemini chat interface.)</p> <p>I&#39;ve noticed that on third-party platforms like OpenRouter, there are multiple date-stamped versions of 2.5 Pro available\u2014like different releases just from May 2025 alone.</p> <p>So my question: when I select &quot;2.5 Pro&quot; on the main Gemini site, does it automatically use the most recent version? Or is there a way to tell which specific version/release date I&#39;m actually using?</p> <p><strong>Second question:</strong> I usually stick with Claude (was using 3.5 Sonnet, now on Opus 4) and GPT-o3, but I tried Gemini 2.5 ",
