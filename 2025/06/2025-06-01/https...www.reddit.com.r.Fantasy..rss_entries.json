I am becoming desensitized at the beginning of books (albeit usually epic fantasy) where you are introduced to a village, protagonist&#39;s lovely family, and then they die. &quot;Yep, I knew that guy was a redshirt. Shouldn&#39;t have stood so close to protagonist&#39;s great uncle that he always looked up too.&quot;</p> <p>As per usual, Terry Pratchett, which can be used for almost all occasions, fits this bill. What else? Special points if it&#39;s a going off on an adventure story without said death occurring to get the ball rolling (I&#39;m looking at you, Kings of the Wyld and One Piece).

Theft of Swords was a pretty breezy read with very familiar tropes and characters spouting lots of expositional dialogue.</p> <p>But towards the end of the first book and through the second and third (I read them as the trilogy being made out of the original six books) I was pleasantly surprised again and again by how Michael J.

It was a pretty good month overall. </p> <p><strong>Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulak (Square: Parents)</strong></p> <p>A young college-age woman recovering from a life-altering opiate addiction takes a summer job as a live-in nanny for a five year old boy in an upscale but small community. The boy soon develops increasingly strange behavior, especially through his drawings that become more and more disturbing and suggest a link to a local ghost story. This was a quick and engaging read, and I thought the use of the boy&#39;s drawings to be an effective technique. Watching stick-figure drawings become increasingly eerie and violent added a nice creep-factor, and I was happy to see it was effective even reading in e-book format.

She\u2019s a fantastic character, a 100% true-blue hero, firmly on the \u201cright side\u201d of the morality line. It was actually quite refreshing to follow someone like that. No grimdark antihero, no gray morality line, just a genuinely good person trying to do the right thing.</p> <p>The worldbuilding was probably the part I liked least. And didn&#39;t dislike it, I just didn&#39;t love it. The worldbuilding is basically Renaissance Italy meets D&amp;D.
