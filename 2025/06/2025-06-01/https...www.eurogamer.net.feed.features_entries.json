We've seen Portal RTX from Nvidia already, along with the development of a full-on remaster of <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2\">Half-Life 2</a> - but I was excited to see a community of modders take on 2004's Painkiller, enhanced now to become Painkiller RTX. It's still a work-in-progress project as of version 0.1.6, but what I've seen so far is still highly impressive - and if you have the means, I recommend checking it out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-painkiller-rtx-is-a-path-traced-upgrade-to-a-classic-but-almost-forgotten-shooter\">Read more</a></p>",
