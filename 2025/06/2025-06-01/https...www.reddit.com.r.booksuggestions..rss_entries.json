Books that address the, \u201cI\u2019ll choose you in every lifetime\u201d type of love. Books that make your heartache because how much they love each other like maybe they find comfort in each other and heal each other in some ways ?? Books that are similar to the movie the notebook or the japanese animated movie Your Name or the time travellers wife. </p> <p>I don\u2019t like books that are overly complicated or have overly flowery language. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sheriecherie\"> /u/sheriecherie </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l0k8o4/books_about_deep_profound_love/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l0k8o4/books_about_deep_profound_love/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I had mentioned my wife being into a genre I learned, was in fact, fairy smut. This didn\u2019t come as much of a shock, but more of an opportunity to connect with her again on a deeper level in our 11 years of marriage. </p> <p>So I decided to start with ACOTAR. It had been suggested numerous time and despite my attempt to shield my virgin eyes I could not stay away. Last night I finished the second book in the series and let me just say WOW! </p> <p>Never in a million years had I imagined being into this type of fantasy novel, laced with romance. I am completely captured by the story. Sarah Maas\u2026 oh Sarah. She has made me feel so many different things already in these two books of the series. You all were right about her writing style fitting into what I had described as my \u201ctaste\u201d. I am still a little shaken up after finishing the second book!",

I&#39;m locked out of my old kindle collection, so I got the subscription service, and I&#39;d love some recommendations for series to read. Despite being in my 30s now, I still love reading YA stuff (I think). Bonus points for a good romance being a part of the story.Here&#39;s some that I remember enjoying:</p> <p>\u2022 The Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne.</p> <p>\u2022 Garth Nix&#39;s series involving Sabriel.</p> <p>\u2022 The Wereworld series.</p> <p>\u2022 The Dark Hunter series by Sherrilyn Kenyon.</p> <p>\u2022 Graceling.</p> <p>\u2022 Seven Songs of Merlin and its sequel series by T. A. Barron.</p> <p>\u2022 The Pendragon series.</p> <p>\u2022 The Books of the Raksura.</p> <p>Any and all recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",

I know about the \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d series, but that is not what I\u2019m looking for.</p> <p>What I love specifically about the show is how it talks about topics such as the LGBTQ community with Cole and Aunt Josephine, the representation of POC in Canada with Bash and the Bog, also the reality of the Indigenous community with the residential schools. I also love the shows approach of Anne\u2019s trauma from her troubling childhood at the orphanage and its approach of the sexism/misogyny/racism that was present during those times. The realism of it all is what really interests me about the show specifically and how it shows topics that are important and that need to be talked about. Also just how well the characters were written and their depth helps you get sucked into the story and you can easily relate to many of the characters because of how complex and real they feel.</p> <",
