Most of the open source projects started because someone hated doing things manually or in the wrong way or they believed the world needs something much better than what is available today. There are also cases of momentary sparks of creativity that leads to a new project. </p> <p>Whatever be the case, building the project, writing the code, docs and examples are probably 50% or less that really brings an OSS project to life \u2014 The community of users and contributors. IMHO, a project is successful when it grows beyond its creator and can have a life of its own. </p> <p>How do you run with your OSS project, drive adoption, fix &amp; improve it and eventually it grows organically with it\u2019s users. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/N1ghtCod3r\"> /u/N1ghtCod3r </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1l0llq5/how_do_you_run_with_your_open_source_project/\">[lin",
