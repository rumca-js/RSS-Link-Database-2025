He&#39;s written plenty of queer characters and by and large his attitude has seemed largely relaxed if at times a bit fetishistic towards gay women. Which is why I was surprised to find a very casual example of homophobia in 1Q84. Towards the end of chapter 19, Aomame is listing examples of &quot;deformed episodes&quot; of humanity and includes Tamaru, describing him as a &quot;powerfully built gay bodyguard&quot;, implying his being muscular and physically competent while gay is oxymoronic and tragic. Now, I recognize that this is leaning towards the classic fallacy of conflating the feelings and opinions of a writer&#39;s character with those of the writer, but here it appeared so casual and",

It\u2019s about a stolen ring that brings torment and suffering to anybody who comes to find it whether their intentions were innocent or greedy until it\u2019s taken back to the rightful owner in his tomb. I found the book a perfect companion for readers who are drawn to ring mystery in Lord of the Rings.</p> <p>To me it read like a book where Astrid Lindgren (if she were to have a kinship for dark mystery) met Lord of the Rings. Definitely a book Jaime Lannister would read on a long ride. A haunting piece of swedish literature with morality, character building and resonance. Brutal\u2026 mysterious. Beautiful book. Had a strong wish to share how I felt about the first book. Definitely my favorite from the trilogy and Selma\u2019s books I read so far.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tornikematcharr",

Currently reading The Last Kingdom by Bernard Cornwell and think it\u2019s brilliant. </p> <p>The only negative i can think is that the book is around Uhtred from young until he gets older, and is very fast paced. Do the books in the series slow down and get more storyline focused?

There&#39;s something deeply satisfying about flipping through pages filled with beautiful illustrations and clear and concise explanations. I love how these books break down complex topics into simple, easy to understand language without overwhelming the reader. The content is well mad, well researched, visually engaging. I noticed on Amazon that many of these books are intended for children aged 9 to 12. I\u2019m an adult man, after all. It got me wondering Should I feel bad for loving books meant for kids?</p> <p>For more context I also have the Encyclopaedia Britannica software on my laptop and I collect graduate level physics and math textbooks (Jackson, Griffiths, Goldstein, Zangwill, Zee, etc.). But I still love children&#39;s books especially those from DK. Every time I go to a bookstore, I have to check out the latest DK releases. Just flippi",
