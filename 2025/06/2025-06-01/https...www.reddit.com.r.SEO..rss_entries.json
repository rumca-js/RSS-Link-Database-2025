Around 2 months back I noticed that my blog had about 1-2k image impressions a month. Then for a few days it started picking up and going to 6k,7k,8k. Around May 15-16, 2025, I noticed my Google Image impressions dropped crazy hard \u2014 from like 10,000 a day to less than 50. It has never recovered. I hardly get 50 image impressions and It\u2019s been super frustrating. </p> <p>I use Rankmath and found out my Rank Math sitemap isn\u2019t including images from my posts at all, even tho the images are properly added and uploaded in the posts.</p> <p>I tried a bunch of stuff already:</p> <ul> <li><p>turned on \u201cInclude Images\u201d in Rank Math sitemap settings</p></li> <li><p>made sure images are in the media library and embedded in posts right</p></li> <li><p>cleared all caches (WP Super Cache + CDN)</p></l",
