I am trying to use ML to detect whether a website needs to use JS rendering to be fully rendered, so I need some dataset of websites that can only be rendered with JS enabled and some dataset of those that do not need rendering. I managed to use publicwww to get 3000 websites that require JS by filtering the websites that are using React, Vue and Angular. But now I&#39;m stuck with trying to figure out how to get the list of websites that do not require javascript to fully render. I&#39;ve tried to scrape neocities websites but I think it&#39;s not enough. Can anyone give me a tip on how to expand the dataset?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SectorIntelligent238\"> /u/SectorIntelligent238 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1l0r4y7/i_need_a_list_of_websites_that_do_not_require_",
