But it was Bayern Munich who progressed, the England captain finally securing a victory when he scored his second with just over quarter of an hour left. Those two goals, along with a Leon Goretzka strike and an own goal from Erick Pulgar saw it finish 4-2, setting up a meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/29/flamengo-bayern-munich-club-world-cup-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
