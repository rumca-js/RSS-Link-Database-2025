I&#39;ve read that with pile shuffling, you want to avoid using a number of piles that evenly divides into the deck (like 3 or 9 for 27), or else you just create patterns instead of randomness. Some say 7 piles is good because it doesn&#39;t divide evenly and creates more chaos (7 / 27 = 0.25925925925925924), but is one round of that enough? Should I do multiple rounds, or mix in a regular overhand shuffle? I did a good wash shuffle when I first got the game.
