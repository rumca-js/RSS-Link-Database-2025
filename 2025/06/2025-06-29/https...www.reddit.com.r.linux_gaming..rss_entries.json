Im very pleased and it was smoother than previous attempts. </p> <p>Background: Ive been able to get my games running in the past, wine to get StarCraft running. So I have that as experience. At some point I had tried SteamOS but found the compatibility wasn\u2019t there. </p> <p>Yesterday, I installed fedora 42, opened software and installed steam. Noticed that the install button was grayed out, so I went to preferences and enabled compatibility (cant remember if steam restarted or my desktop) either way, then it came back on, I now saw the install button, great! After the smooth install, I ran the game but noticed 14 fps, so I immediately knew it was running off the iGPU. I opened software again and installed nvidia drivers. Ran the game again and got 100 fps. </p> <p>Great experience overall! Almost getting to excellent! </p> <p>I think Im ready to completely ditch windows. </p> <p>Tha",

So every time I open Elden Ring Nightreign the game starts with around 30 - 40 fps and is not really playable, and after some time it gets to 60 and sometimes doesn&#39;t even stay there (in some occasions I&#39;ve had it drop down to 30 again - while being in game). I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the shaders compiling, but I&#39;m wondering if it really is that and if it&#39;s supposed to be happening every time.</p> <p>If anyone has some info I would be really glad to hear you out.</p> <p>My specs:</p> <p>Kernel: 6.15.4-arch2-1</p> <p>DE: KDE Plasma 6.4.1</p> <p>WM: KWin (Wayland)</p> <p>CPU: i5 12400</p> <p>GPU: GTX 1660 Ti</p> <p>Nvidia drivers: nvidia-open-575.64-5</p> <p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1lneu87/video/bpqz6f7wcv9f1/player\">The jump from 40 to 60</a></p> <p>If any more info is needed I&#39;m willing to provide. </p> </div><!--",

I haven\u2019t tested yet if it will work and if I will need Proton.</p> <p>However, my main question is whether I may play LCPDFR on Linux Mint. For those who don\u2019t know, an app must be installed and you search for it by the name \u201cGTA 4 Downgrader\u201d. After the game is downgraded to the version 1.0.7.0, the next step is to install a file from the LCPDFR website and configure the mod.</p> <p>Will all this work?
