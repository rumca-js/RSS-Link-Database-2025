        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><em>The Wheel of Time</em> TV series, was an ambitious fantasy adaptation that attempted to bring Robert Jordan\u2019s sprawling world to life. Set in a universe where time is cyclical and magic is real, the series followed Moiraine, a powerful member of the Aes Sedai, a woman who wields magical power, as she sought to find and then protect the prophesied Dragon Reborn who is destined to either save or destroy the world.</p> <p>Visually, the show is beautiful with its sweeping landscapes, detailed sets, and gorgeous costume design that help viewers immerse themselves in the lore-heavy world. The showrunners have taken multiple creative liberties, which has sparked mostly outrage among book fans, but the changes are supposed to help make the dense source material more accessible to newcomers.</p> <p>Some pacing issues occurred in the first season, and the dialogue designed to build the world slowed momentum, but the stakes and intrigue steadily built.

But I\u2019m looking for books like the format of discworld or the star wars expanded universe. What are some books that share the same setting but each book or collection within them explores different areas, characters, and times within the series.</p> <p>It can be like discworld where there are reoccurring characters or sub-series (like the Death and City Watch books in discworld), but the books are more about showing off a rich setting. Bonus if the books are spread out in time and they are written by one or only a few authors.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Illeterate1\"> /u/Illeterate1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ln5y11/a_series_where_the_books_narratives_arent_related/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fan",

Not historical fantasy nor fantasy set in another world that mirrors ours but with magic (\u00e0 la Guy Gavriel Kay), but a story set in our world where a major event changed the course of history, said major event being fantastical in nature and having a deep impact on geopolitics. Bonus points if there are sci-fi elements (advanced technology, sentient machines...). If anything like this exists it would make me really happy at the moment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Monkontheseashore\"> /u/Monkontheseashore </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ln2ubf/alternate_history_with_fantasy_elements/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h",
