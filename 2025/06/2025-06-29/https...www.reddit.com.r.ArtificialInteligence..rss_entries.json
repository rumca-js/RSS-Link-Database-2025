Here are the key findings:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Enhanced Writer Agency</strong>: Students using a process-oriented AI tool, Script&amp;Shift, reported higher levels of control and satisfaction over their writing process compared to those using a traditional chat-based writing assistant or a standard writing interface.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deeper Knowledge Transformation</strong>: The study demonstrated that Script&amp;Shift not only facilitated greater agency but also led to more profound knowledge transformation, supporting writers in synthesizing and organizing content more",
