The protagonist is not winning any beauty contests, and there is no big moral lesson waiting at the end (or worse, lurking throughout the film). There is plenty of cringe, but it&#39;s earned -- not just cringe for cringe&#39;s sake. Is it a flawless film? No, but if you&#39;ve been hurting for a 90s-style comedy that doesn&#39;t ask too much of the viewer but gives plenty of laughs in return, I cannot recommend <em>Let&#39;s Start a Cult</em> highly enough.</p> <p>I went into it blind and, having now watched the trailer in consideration of linking it in this post, I would suggest doing the same for maximum good-times effect.

So why?</p> <p>Roy&#39;s final monologue seemed to imply that Roy as a replicant has just as much humanity as a human. Yet moments earlier he was cackling maniacally and happily toying with his prey. If there had been any indication of his humanity earlier in the film, his change of heart would make more sense to me.

In the film, we see two young lovers rebel against society and try to find their own lives. A typical coming-of-age story, it begins with a young orphan named Sam trying to find himself in society by participating in volunteer work during wartime. He then tries to flee the nest by escaping his camp and his foster parents. As the story progresses, he eventually finds himself in the vast, open world, falling in love with another young, rebellious girl named Suzy. Their friendship bonds as they sit by the campfire, tell stories, wander through the maze of lush green forests, and sit on the beach as the tiny waves ripple on the golden sand. Sam and Suzy are two of the most endearing children in the Wes Anderson universe, especially Suzy, who acts as an older, mother-like figure to Sam as she reads stories to him and helps guide him on his journey.</p> <p>The final torrential d",
