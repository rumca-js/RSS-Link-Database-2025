I suspect on windows 95, but it could have been dos. A lot of the game was set in either a castle or a mansion and to move levels you had to make it to a specific part of the room- it felt like a mysterious game to me at time. The design was 2d (not extremely simple but also not very detailed - I think I remember pixels) and I think you could only move in squares. My most salient memory is of the baddies- they bobbed, the were kind of horse shaped (like chess knights), they had air horned shaped mouths and I think would should balls at you from these mouths.</p> <p>Long shot, but I thought I\u2019d try!</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
