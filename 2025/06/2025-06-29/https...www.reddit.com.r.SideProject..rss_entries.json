No subscriptions, no bloated features. Just a smart assistant that actually helps visitors and doesn\u2019t charge you every month.</p> <p>What began as a weekend project for a friend ( you know that friend once knows you code he pitches ideas..) has grown faster than I thought. People seem to like the simplicity and the one-time pricing.</p> <p>The thing is\u2026 I haven\u2019t really \u201claunched\u201d it properly. I\u2019m still working full-time, and I haven\u2019t made much noise online about it yet. Mostly because I didn\u2019t want to deal with coworkers raising eyebrows or asking too many questions.<",
