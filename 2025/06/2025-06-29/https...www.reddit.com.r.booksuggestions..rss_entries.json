However, now I\u2019m going back to school to be a librarian and want to read more fiction so I can know what folks are talking about but, like a podcast that\u2019s been going for years that everyone except you had listened to, I feel like choosing what to read first is so daunting. I\u2019m not big on thrillers or horror in general. Just looking for a good story to distract me from\u2026everything. Also not big on romance at the moment as I\u2019m going through a divorce and that just\u2026hits too close to home right now.

Brite\u2019s other works are always an option and I\u2019ve been eyeing them HOWEVER! what makes me love EC so much is that it\u2019s realistic (if you will). What I mean by that is that it\u2019s not supernatural. Essentially I am asking for books about bad people committing crimes while passionately in love. The weirder and grosser the better! And preferably Queer. I know of books like Mindfuck and Bucther &amp; Blackbird however they seem too mild for me + they are heterosexual romances and I really do prefer queer storylines.

Harlen, and honestly-it was such a breath of fresh air! I&#39;ve been reading so many dark romances lately where the MMC constantly abuses the FMC, and she still ends up falling for him without any real redemption arc. I do enjoy dark romance, but l&#39;ve come to realize that the ones without any redemption just aren&#39;t for me. After consuming so many of them, I got exhausted.</p> <p>So when I read Break Her (spoilers ahead \u203c\ufe0f), I loved that she doesn&#39;t fall in love with him after everything he put her through. In fact, she wins and that was so satisfying.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m really craving more stories where the FMC doesn&#39;t fall in love after enduring cruelty or abuse, and she succeeds in the end. Please emphasize that she succeeds!! I don&#39;t mind if the MMC ends up falling for her, that&#39;s fin",

I recently finished &quot;Beloved&quot; by Toni Morrison and &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; by Kazuo Ishiguro\u2014both of which I found absolutely incredible.</p> <p>I used to read a lot of M/M fanfiction in high school and have recently been dabbling in reading some again, and it&#39;s reminded me of this feeling of yearning that was such a core part of what made reading fanfiction so fun for me in high school.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the writing in 90% of fanfictions is not of the best caliber, so I wanted to ask if anyone had any recommendations for any good queer romance novels. I tried looking online but I&#39;m only really finding YA stuff like &quot;Red, White, and Royal Blue,&quot; whereas I&#39;m looking for something more akin to &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (though ideally with a happier ending!)

I\u2019m looking for some kind of fantasy book, preferably standalone. (Having it be a series might put me off for now, since I\u2019m just looking to get into reading again. Maybe later though) I want there to be slow burn while also not having the relationship be the main focus of the book. It can be but I prefer it not to be. I love forbidden love, enemies to lovers, that kind of spiel. But I don\u2019t want there to be any spice, only if it serves a purpose to the plot.
