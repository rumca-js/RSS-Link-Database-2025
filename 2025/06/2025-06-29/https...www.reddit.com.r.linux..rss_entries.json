The course was very helpful to describe the core mechanics of Linux, but didn&#39;t talk that much about different distro&#39;s. I&#39;m currently running Ubuntu 24.04 on my desktop in dualboot with Win10 (for gaming and some Windows-specific software that can&#39;t run on Linux), but I&#39;m looking into changing to Fedora since some of my teachers that like Linux has spoken very highly about it. They&#39;ve also spoken bad about Ubuntu, but never explained why.</p> <p>So I am actually very curious, what is the actual differences between Ubuntu and Fedora, and why are people giving Ubuntu so much crap?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ospery1\"> /u/ospery1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1lnscf5/difference_between_ubuntudebian_and_fedor",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR: Modern Linux drivers and hardware compatibility are not as finicky as some people say.</p> <p>My government keeps trying to break our energy system to goodbye; a recent malfunction of power mains fried my old PC&#39;s PSU and motherboard but the drive fortunately survived. I bought a slightly more recent system on the local flea market (i5-7400 instead of the old i7-3770K) for the whole whopping \u20ac70 and plugged the drive into it. The drive had both Windows 10 and Fedora 42 KDE installed.</p> <p>The outcome: Fedora picked up the new hardware like nothing happened but Windows is stuck on &quot;getting devices ready&quot; forever. Guess it&#39;s time to reclaim the Windows partition.</p> <p>Great job, Fedora and Linux in general. I had to tell it someone and decided to do it here because where else, right.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/githman\"> /u/githman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ww",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is one of my major issues with linux and one of the things that windows does better. being able to search for any type of software be it FOSS or proprietary, downloading an .exe and installing it is easy and straight forward, and 99 percent of the time you get it straight from the developers website. Linux falls short with having to either trust 3rd party repackages or (like in the case of protonvpn) adding a whole separate repo just for one program. </p> <p>Most people here are going to say &quot;but you could click a malicious link by mistake&quot; i could see that happening to a lot of new users and this is something that google search needs to work on.</p> <p>However when you have it all setup managing and updating software is amazing on linux! Gone are the issues when opening up a piece of software you haven&#39;t used in a while and having to wait for updates. everything all packages/programs/etc are updated all at once.</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
