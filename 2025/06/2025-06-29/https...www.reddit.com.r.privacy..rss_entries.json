I have not even seen him for the past two weeks. This past week he started figuring out my location?!? </p> <p>I don\u2019t think he installed any apps on my phone as he does not know my password.</p> <p>He\u2019s been sending me messages asking about places I\u2019ve been. SPECIFIC places I\u2019ve been. He literally told me he\u2019s been pinging my phone too. Either towns or exact addresses. I called my cellphone provider and they said it\u2019s got nothing to do with my phone number. </p> <p>I\u2019m so scared guys. I work in computer repair and am so confused here. Did I accidentally accept a permission on my phone or what?</p> <p>Sorry this is written so poorly I am shaking in fear </p> <p>1st update: thank you for all the advice so far! I appreciate every single one of you I think I have two reasonable options of how he could be doing it. There was on",
