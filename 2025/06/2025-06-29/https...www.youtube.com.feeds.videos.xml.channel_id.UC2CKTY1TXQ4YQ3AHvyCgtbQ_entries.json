        "description": "And it's not only the crazy-looking Horus Heresy terminators, either: I haven't seen a new model for Warhammer 40,000 or Horus Heresy that has \"spoke\" to me in some time. But Age of Sigmar and even The Old World have been KILLING it (hello Cathay). So what gives? I'll talk about that, and of course I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made ANOTHER game!
