Beestation seems like a great \u201cplug-and-play\u201d option, but I haven\u2019t seen many general consumer reviews regarding BeePhotos and its usage. I might do a combination of both: use Ente as my primary photo library, and use the BeeStation as an on-site backup option.</p> <p>If I go with BeeStation as my primary storage source, I\u2019d use an encrypted cloud service (maybe proton or pcloud) as an offsite backup.

I kinda knew about this before, but now that I digged further, it makes me realize how unacceptable this is. I&#39;ve been trying to degoogle and desamsung my current phone, but I didn&#39;t really want to uninstall or disable anything in case I break anything, so I guess the best option is to buy a Pixel and install GrapheneOS. I saw in BackMarket a refurbished Pixel 7 for aproximately 160\u20ac, and if I give my phone as well I get a discount of 130\u20ac. I think this is a bargain, though maybe my A54 is better than a Pixel 7. I&#39;ve also considered buying a refurbished Pixel 8 and then install GrapheneOS since its better than a Pixel 7, but right now I don&#39;t have enough money for it. If anyone can help me with this, I&#39;d be deeply thankful. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/M",
