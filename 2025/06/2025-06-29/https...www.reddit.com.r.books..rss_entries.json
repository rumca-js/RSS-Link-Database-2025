I know I will never read them all, I accept that I will die with unread books, and I am actually okay with that. </p> <p>The issue is simply clutter and physical space limitations. If I had a house where I could have a room for all of my books, that would solve the problem. But the unfortunate reality is that I will probably die a renter and not even a renter of a house, but an apartment. And the books are just everywhere and it makes things feel claustrophobic and cluttered and messy to me. </p> <p>One issue I have is I tend to hold onto certain items for nostalgic reasons and that includes books. Realistically I will never read them again\u2014I KNOW I won\u2019t. But they remind me of a period of time of my life I sort of enjoyed.

You have the possibility to take with you all the books of one author. Who would you choose and why?</p> <p>For me, the choice would be between Agatha Christie and Jules Verne.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read a bunch of books written by the queen of mystery herself, Agatha Christie, and I&#39;ve realized I didn&#39;t dislike any of them.
