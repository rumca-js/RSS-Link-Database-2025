My 2D gaming mind had no idea how to understand a game that seemed so comfortable in three dimensions, but which also - after years of seeing increasingly refined pixel art - seemed so comfortable with being so ragged. The gaps in Lara's polygonal joints. The clipping of 3D surfaces. The way the polygons around the sides of the screen sometimes disappeared giving the image the perforated edge of a postage stamp.
