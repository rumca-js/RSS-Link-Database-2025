Rumor has it that valve stopped producing the base stations and controllers about a year ago.

However I am unsure if it is worth the investment to buy a VR headset right now or wait for the game market to mature a bit more. I was thinking about Quest 3 or even the ValveIndex.</p> <p>As for context I got a RTX 3050 (laptop) 6GB VRAM, Ryzen series 7, and 16GB RAM. In my experience I can play whatever game even ran Cyberpunk (newest patches) with no problems.</p> <p>I do have in plan to upgrade to a decent rig but that is a bit further into the future (&gt;1 year or so).</p> <p>So do I just go for it, is it worth it?
