So, the link above allows you to sign up for a weekly email that delivers these 10 summaries to your inbox. The newsletter is completely free, and shouldn&#39;t overflow your inbox either.</p> <p>The summaries can come in different flavors, &quot;Informal&quot; and &quot;TLDR&quot;. If you&#39;re just looking for quick bullet points about papers and already have some subject expertise, I recommend using the &quot;TLDR&quot; format.

It&#39;s described as a comfortable and convenient living experience, particularly appealing to working millennials. The property is situated in a vibrant neighborhood with easy access to transportation, shopping, and dining. </p> <p>For context, a friend is moving to LA and doesn&#39;t know So Cal at all. She somehow stumbled on The Dunes appartments which are located in Inglewood CA and was wowed by the AI description. I explained to her except for a few parts, Inglewood isn&#39;t a place you want to move to. And the Dunes 100% isn&#39;t somewhere anyone willingly moves to. </p> <p>I have no idea where Google AI got it&#39;s info from here, maybe their AI has learned to lie. I&#39;ve been to the Dunes at night and it was semi terrifying lol. And I&#39;m usually whatever about &quot;bad&quot",
