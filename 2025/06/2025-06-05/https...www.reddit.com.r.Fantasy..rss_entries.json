A big thank you to the person who mentioned this show. </p> <p>S&amp;A is a masterpiece. The creators of the show do seem to have a wealth of knowledge and appreciation for literature and it shows. </p> <p>The way Geoffrey Tennant (played by Paul Gross, who is an amazing actor btw) explains character motivations blew my mind. I had never looked at Shakespeare and his works that way. </p> <p>I am going to work my way through all of Shakespeares&#39; plays now. </p> <p>This show has changed how I read fiction and think about characters and their actions. It just increased my love for literature even more. </p> <p>It reminded me a lot of the movie &#39;Shakespeare in Love&#39;. If you liked this movie, then definitely give this show a shot. It is available for on Youtube to watch. I can&#39;t recommend this",

I have read quite a few of the commonly talked about series on here, kingkiller, ASOIAF, mistborn, SLA, First Law, Gentlemen Bastards, but for most of them switching between povs drags me out of the story as there is always one PoV I like the most and I resent the other PoVs for getting in the way, or the flashbacks taking me out of the present. The biggest example is SLA and First Law, Kaladin and Glokta are super interesting (in a totally different way) and I always want to be following them and I have ended up not liking the other characters because they steal page time. </p> <p>So any series where the main characters are like either of them or anything in-between recommend away please! Happy to be from dark or even light fantasy so long as the main character is interesting to follow. And remember please no flashbacks it&#39;s my worst part about fantasy books in general. </p> </di",

My hypothesis is that since listening is slower, I have more time to analyze each and every plot point, characterization, and worldbuilding. </p> <p>For example, I\u2019m reading the audiobook of Drop of Corruption right now and every time Din says \u201cmy eyes flickered\u201d I roll my eyes a little since I\u2019ve heard it 20 times\u2026.but I doubt I would have even noticed it in a text copy. It\u2019s probably going to be 4/5 for me and I wonder if I would\u2019ve given it 5/5 as a physical book</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hoattzin\"> /u/hoattzin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l3m9gn/for_people_who_do_both_audiobooks_and_physical/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1l3m9gn/for_people_who_do_both_audiobooks_and_physical/\">[comments]</a><",
