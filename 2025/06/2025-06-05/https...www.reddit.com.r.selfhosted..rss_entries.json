I ask because I have a few services that I use Authentik to authenticate with, while others have their own 2FA system built into the service. Some examples of these &quot;built-in 2FA&quot; services are Home Assistant, Nextcloud, and Proxmox. I currently have Home Assistant and Nextcloud exposed to the Internet, but I&#39;ve read that you should be hesitant on exposing Proxmox to the Internet (for obvious reasons). However, I&#39;ve just enabled the &quot;TFA&quot; setting in my node&#39;s settings.</p> <p>Is this something like this sufficient enough to expose to the Internet, or should I put Authentik over it? If Authentik, it would probably be a Proxy Provider, given that I don&#39;t see within Proxmox where I could add OAuth2 for authentication.

I run them with the cloudflare DNS and point to my IP. Everything working flawlessly and that is where I think I might be missing something.

Both of these virtual devices where on the same proxmox host.</p> <p>New situation is that I have a separate proxmox host with the VM running and a separate machine for NAS purposes. Yes, I still could re-create the same situation as before, but I&#39;m having doubts.</p> <p>What is the main public here recommending to do:</p> <ol> <li>Same setup as the old one will do fine and easy to backup all the docker data</li> <li>Create a SMB share on the new machine running the VM + docker to store the docker data, which you can access to backup</li> <li>Don&#39;t make things more complicated as is, use the new VM and have everything store inside this VM. PBS will then backup the VM. Though, if ",

I came across <a href=\"https://mailtester.ninja/\">https://mailtester.ninja/</a> recently, and it seems simple enough, it checks MX records and tries to verify if an email address exists without sending anything. It\u2019s useful, but I\u2019m not sure how accurate or scalable it is for larger use cases. </p> <p>Has anyone tried self-hosting an alternative tool like this? Something that can handle bulk checks, avoid false positives with catch-all domains, and maybe even flag risky or disposable emails? Ideally something that doesn&#39;t rely on API limits or expensive credits per lookup would be awesome. </p> <p>Would love to hear what others here are using. Are there any open-source projects or lightweight scripts that actually work well for this,",
