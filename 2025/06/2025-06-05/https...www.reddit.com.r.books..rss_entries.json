Here\u2019s a personal ranking of some recent reads, from most to least favorite\u2014just hoping to spark discussion and maybe get a few more recommendations in this lane:</p> <h1>1. Dead City by Shane Stevens</h1> <p>A dark masterpiece. It\u2019s like if <em>The Sopranos</em> met <em>Taxi Driver</em> in novel form. Stevens creates a chillingly believable protagonist and dives deep into the psyche of a hitman. Gritty, sharp, unforgettable. Criminally underrated.</p> <h1>2. No Beast So Fierce by Edward Bunker</h1> <p>This one hits hard. It\u2019s like reading the inside of a convict\u2019s mind\u2014makes sense, since Bunker lived that life. The parole system, street code, and desperation are written with a brutal honesty that makes you sit up.</p> <h1>",

A group of friends are reassembled in the last days of the war for the mission but not all make it home, and one refused to take part. All the remaining members are coping with the guilt differently. Two refuse to climb at all, until dying request of their mentor and their struggles to cope with post-war life motivate them to tackle the route once again.
