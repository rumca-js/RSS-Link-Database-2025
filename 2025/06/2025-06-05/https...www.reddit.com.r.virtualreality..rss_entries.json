Still, I did not feel that the overlap here is a problem. The panels are so bright that you do not really see that the non-overlapping part is much darker, which normally is a problem for bad overlap. Also, you ",

Gaming is a secondary aspect, this is primarily for my work as a developer. I&#39;m very interested in doing this but there&#39;s a large buy-in so I don&#39;t want to go in half-cocked. I have a pair of Bowers and Wilkins Px7 S2&#39;s that I&#39;d like to continue using, and I&#39;m looking at the tap-strap 2 as my mouse/keyboard.
