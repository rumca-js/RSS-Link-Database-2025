I always found it hard to know what a \u201cbetter\u201d alternative really means for the foods I love (like finding something with more protein but similar calories).</p> <p>So I built a little app that lets me type in a food I usually eat (say, chocolate bar or instant noodles), and it gives me healthier alternatives, matched on calories but better for my goals (like more fiber, less sugar, more protein, etc.). It also explains <em>why</em> the swap might be better, which helps me learn and stay motivated.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t expect it to be so useful, but I\u2019ve started using it every day. It\u2019s really helping me avoid some bad habits without feeling like I\u2019m restricting myself too much.</p> <p>Curious if anyone else has tried building something like this for themselves?

You can organize links into workspaces, keep track of what you\u2019ve read, and even ask questions about your saved articles using AI. Kind of like chatting with your own reading list.</p> <p>I just opened up the public beta and I\u2019m looking for a few people who\u2019d be up for trying it out and jumping on a quick 1:1 call to share feedback. Nothing formal, just want to hear what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.</p> <p>As a thank-you, I\u2019m offering 3 months free.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested, feel free to DM me or check out the site.

Over time, I\u2019ve worked with several third-party SDKs that provide these features, but I\u2019ve found them to be extremely expensive and overly complicated to integrate. On top of that, switching between services is a nightmare\u2014you often have to restructure large parts of your codebase, which can be a time-consuming and frustrating process.</p> <p>To solve these problems, I\u2019ve built my own video and audio calling SDK. It allows you to integrate high-quality calling features into your app with just <strong>four lines of code</strong>(literally 4 lines of code). It\u2019s also highly flexible, especially when it comes to UI customization, giving you full control over how it looks and behaves within your app.</p> <p>Right now, the SDK is still in the testing phase, but if anyone is interested in trying it out, feel free",
