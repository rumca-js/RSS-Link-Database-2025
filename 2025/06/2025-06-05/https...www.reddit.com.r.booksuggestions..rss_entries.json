He might be more willing to read something he might have heard before (he&#39;s 50).

I read a lot of non-fiction (and some fantasy/sci-fi that often has LGBTQ leads), but she\u2019s more interested in fiction generally, though she does love a good romance. What she wants in a book lays in the world-building and loose ends that make you double back and even encourage you to re-read the book\u2014if it\u2019s good enough. I\u2019ve laid out the \u201cdream requirements\u201d she has given me over the years below, and I thank y\u2019all in advance for any recommendations you can give!

However, the mane characteristic that made me enjoy that book, in my opinion, was the voice. The author won&#39;t ever introduce an element &quot;out of nothing&quot;. He&#39;ll almost all the time make the narrator live something and then use the experience to introduce an absolutism. (i.e. : &quot;I saw this old lady walking slowly in the street, it seems awful for her. ... Old ladies are slow&quot;). There are obviously a lot of other very interesting things to mention about this text, but I will keep to that.</p> <p>My question is; Would you guys maybe have ideas of other books with this same (or similar) dynamic ?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/idkhowtowhatever\"> /u/idkhowtowhatever </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l3",

I\u2019ve also just reread Naomi Alderman\u2019s \u2018The Lessons\u2019 and Benjamin Wood\u2019s \u2018The Bellwether Revivals\u2019. I love these books - but I\u2019m looking for something a little different. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking for dark academia meets slice of life. The first half of The Secret History only. Where they\u2019re in the countryside, relaxing, reading, enjoying the lifestyle that has been afforded ti them. Not a plot driven book, but a book of the mundane. A book that shows both the glitz of wealth and the drone of rigorous academia. </p> <p>I don\u2019t want the \u2018murder murder murder!\u2019 to be the point of the book - if it\u2019s there, fine - but what I want is to be able to dwell in the characters\u2019 lifestyle rather than their action. </p> <p>Not sure if this makes any sense. Appreciate any suggestions:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I (29M) have been dating my partner (29F) for a little over a year now. We met when she was already separated from her ex-husband, but lots of paperwork led to the legal divorce taking a while. It was not a good marriage at all, including abuse and cheating, and she has a lot of trauma from it and I wanted to see if anybody had recommendations on resources I could read to help be a better partner for her. </p> <p>She goes to therapy and is on medication which helps a lot, but still has some stuff going on in the brain that I would like to understand better. We have a great relationship and she says none of it has to do with me, so anything that helps me get more in her headspace or suggestions on things I can do to help her through things would be awesome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dashlink23\"> /u/Dashlink23 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l3n9az",

I am heartbroken from this decision and don&#39;t have a lot of money or anywhere to stay with my family. I want something I can get invested to on my long journey back home. I like wonder and fascinating environments especially where there is a younger lead character. I would be downloading an audiobook and listening to switch up from music. Please recommend something that you have read in the past that kept you very engaged and left feeling with some sense of desire or wonder!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/uncram\"> /u/uncram </a> <b",
