        "description": "Polyphony's Gran Turismo 7 is over three years old on PS4 and PS5. It arrived amid extensive hype, some controversy over cross-gen releases, and more exclusives for the PS5, but that didn't diminish its gorgeous visuals, incredible realism or extensive selection of cars.\n\nAfter a brief controversy over progression and monetization, the racing sim has received consistent content updates ever since. New vehicles, World Circuit events, GT Cafe Bonus and Extra Books, more Music Rally tracks, Scapes, the list goes on. Polyphony even added heavily requested features like selling cars and Engine Swaps for select vehicles. It even made the entire game playable in VR for free.\n\nTo that end, even though Gran Turismo 7 isn't as old as titles like, say, No Man's Sky, the extent of free post-launch support has been impressive. Despite a few shortcomings, it's the definitive modern racing sim, catering to enthusiasts and newcomers with its range of challenges and cars.",
