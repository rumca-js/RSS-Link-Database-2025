This can have adverse effects on the look of some games, and especially so if you're connecting the Switch 2 to a display with poor or nonexistent HDR support.</p><p>Navigating to the Settings menu, heading down to Display, and toggling HDR Output from \"Always Enabled\" to \"Compatible Software Only\" will ensure that the Switch 2 only activates HDR when playing games that support it, leaving those that don't in their standard SDR format.</p><a",
