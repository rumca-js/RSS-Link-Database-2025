However, these explanations can misrepresent the model&#39;s &quot;reasoning&quot; process, i.e., they can be <em>unfaithful</em>. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level <em>concepts</em> in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that the LLM&#39;s <em>explanations imply</em> are influential and the set that <em>truly</em> are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness",

Are these individuals genuinely unaware that AI is merely a tool? Students can utilize it appropriately, while they can also misuse it. Personally, as a visually impaired student, I employ AI to assist me in generating my essays and assignments. My instructors do not instruct me to write in braille; instead, they prefer that I adhere to the traditional writing method. Unfortunately, I am unable to perform the traditional method due to my blindness. Consequently, I utilize generative AI to support me in generating my work, and I subsequently print it myself. What is the issue with this approach? Instead of embracing technology, these individuals resist its adoption.
