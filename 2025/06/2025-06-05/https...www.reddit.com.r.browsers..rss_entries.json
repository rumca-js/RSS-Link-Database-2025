Recently i looked into password managers and idk browsers that care more about privacy and now i speak about android. I tried brave, firefox for exemple and one of the things i can&#39;t understand it&#39;s why if you make the browser towards privacy you forget about basic things? The best exemple is how in opera you have arrows for forward/back always on the screen, you don&#39;t need to press on settings for that. Idk how much of a big deal is for others, but i can&#39;t get around why they would make a browser focused on privacy and instead of making it attractive and easy to use for anyone, they just don&#39;t care and make it in a way it&#39;s more convenient to go for something like opera for exemple. As the last thing, did i miss any good browser that&#39;s towards privacy that can be customised properly, that have at least arrows for back/forward? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

I originally used chrome then switched to opera due to the tab islands that I can pin my usual go to tabs and websites like social media, emails etc so I don&#39;t have to type them in manually. Then I switched to Arc since I liked the &quot;Spaces&quot; since I liked the interface and it had clear spaces where I can just switch to go to Work tabs, school tabs, social media. PLUS I really loved how I can use my PC browser to check the things from my mac browser, and just the whole &quot;sync&quot; workflow in general. However since I&#39;ve heard that Arc was abandoned, I need a recommendation to what browser I should switch to. Any suggestions on similar browsers or browsers with those features that I can try? Thanks so much!</p> <p>TLDR: Loved Arc but need to change browser, any similar to that or what should I try/change to?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
