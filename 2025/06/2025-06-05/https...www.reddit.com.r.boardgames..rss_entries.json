I saw several versions(Spanish, Korean, German, Ukrainian\u2026) which I assumed contained the same content but with language translation - until I saw a card for Vasilisa the Wise*. As a hobby folklorist I was excited to see character representation from other cultures, but it appears that this card is only present in that region\u2019s version of the game. This led me to wonder whether there is localization for other regional versions of the game, and also to think about translation vs. localization for games in general.</p> <p>My questions to you:</p> <p>Have you played a regional version of Rebel Princess and know of other variant cards?</p> <p>What other games have you played which are regionally localized well, and in what ways?</p> <p>*You can see the card I\u2019m referring to in the BGG images for the Deluxe Edition of Rebel Princess.

And clearly there\u2019s some similarities there, they\u2019re each mostly card based and you pick a character with a very clear and specific playstyle. So I\u2019m guessing that just seems to be what I love the most and I have no clue where to find more games that could fit into that mold. Any ideas? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Prestigious_Tea_2729\"> /u/Prestigious_Tea_2729 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1l492x9/what_other_games_might_fit_this_genre/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1l492x9/what_other_games_might_fit_this_genre/\">[comments]</a></span>",
