        "description": "I\u2019ve never been the biggest Star Wars fan\u2014but Andor changed it for my dumb face. This is Star Wars at its absolute best, and in this review of Andor Seasons 1 and 2, I\u2019ll explain how it managed to win me over and make me eat my words about the franchise, at least this one time. \n\nFrom the writing to the performances, worldbuilding, and mature storytelling, Andor is something different. It\u2019s proof that Star Wars doesn\u2019t need Jedi to be brilliant\u2014it just needs to be this planned out!
