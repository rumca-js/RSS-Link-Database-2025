        "description": "With the brand new \"Witcher 4\" Tech demo showcase, and an implication that this is indicative of actual gameplay, I think its time to remember that the Industry standard is to overhype, showcase \"in engine\" footage that is not actually achievable, and then under deliver.\n\nWith a multitude of examples across the past few decades (high profile, and from top level industry publishers) I think its good to temper expectations. \n\nI hope I end up being wrong, but the Witcher 4 feels like a prime candidate for future downgrades, based on the fact that showing a perfectly crafted \"hope\" is far more lucrative than showing a conservatively crafted reality. \n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonsecurity\n\n\n\n\nODYSEE I",
