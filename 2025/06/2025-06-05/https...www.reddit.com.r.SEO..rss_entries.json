I have been an associate in NYC for about 1 year and 4 months. I get paid around 40k yearly, entry-level, fresh out of college. After about 8 months I realized I work quite a bit like creating 4-5 different reports monthly, getting google console data and creating graphs declaring popular keywords that contributed to the clicks etc, Along with doing the usual metadata for webpages like meta title, descriptions URLs I also can do redirects and do them almost daily along with handling some projects on schema building and all. So, I am wondering if I should go for a senior associate role now or what I am actually doing is common for my entry-level role with 40k pay</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zunaid_Akond\"> /u/Zunaid_Akond </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/S",

The main goal is to generate leads and have a decent google search ranking.<br/> My question is pretty much in the title but I&#39;ll expand a little. Most of my pages have text in my jpeg image. For instance my &quot;about&quot; section and &quot;booking info&quot; section feature a jpg with a couple paragraphs of text. Will this negatively affect my SEO even if I have alt tags on the images? </p> <p>Any advice is greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/woodcomedy\"> /u/woodcomedy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1l3nvkh/will_having_text_in_my_jpg_images_hurt_my_page/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1l3nvkh/will_having_text_in_my_jpg_images_hurt_my_page/\">[comments]</a></span>",
