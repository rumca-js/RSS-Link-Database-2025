I\u2019m only using two buttons on the four button one and only one in the one with two buttons. </p> <p>Not sure if i can clone the two frequencies from the newer remote to the older one since they\u2019re different types of hardware. but i\u2019m 99% sure i can buy a new remote from aliexpress for 3\u20ac and clone my existing one .</p> <p>i do not own a frequency analyser, but i think it\u2019s not necessary to own one if im just cloning my existing controller. </p> <p>looking for general advice on this but if anyone has experience and step by steps i would definitely be open to that! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/koronou\"> /u/koronou </a> <",
