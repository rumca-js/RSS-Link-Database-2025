J&#39;essais de chiffrer les donn\u00e9s avec AES CBC 256 bits avec une cl\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par le serveur. Jusqu&#39;ici tout est okay mais le seul probl\u00e8me c&#39;est pour le d\u00e9chiffrement. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu un max d&#39;article j&#39;ai compris qu&#39;on ne peut pas enregistrer la cl\u00e9 de d\u00e9chiffrement en clair dans le fichier. (ce qui est logique d&#39;ailleur). alors quand je cherche sur internet je vois une solution, c&#39;est d&#39;utiliser le keystore de java mais as3 ne donne pas de passerelle pour faire ce",

I&#39;m thinking about having logs online/active for about 90 days and offline/cold for up to 6 years. The retention period is based on IR team decision and compliance and regulatory requirements. Having them online is not an issue with most SIEMs I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s not that big of a deal even though it&#39;s expensive. On the other hand cold storage logs for 6 years it&#39;s a big deal, given the fact that I need to have all endpoint, firewall, cloud and any other security log there. </p> <p>I want to hear what you guys have in place for this, it&#39;s always helpful to hear other professionals with experience on this, and because it&#39;s a brand new implementation, I want it to be as &quot;greenfield&quot; as possible. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre",
