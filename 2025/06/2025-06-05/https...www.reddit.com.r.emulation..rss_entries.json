Playback is done through a pretty abstract library that is built into the PSP firmware, but often is also shipped on disc.</p> <p>Our previous implementation was mostly based on guesswork and vibes, but this time I&#39;ve reverse engineered in detail how it works, mainly through intense testing on hardware. This has fixed a large number of long-standing compatibility problems - for example, the music in Flatout now finally works correctly.</p> <p>Addi",
