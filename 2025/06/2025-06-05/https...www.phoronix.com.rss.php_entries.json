No longer is it typically a worry of whether your mouse, 56K modem, WiFi adapter, or other basic peripherals working but most often just a matter of how well the performance is on Linux, whether there is LVFS/Fwupd firmware updating support, and if other non-show-stopping features are supported. We still haven't managed the \"year of the Linux desktop\" but it's been wild with Chrome OS and Android being based on Linux, Linux coming to dominate the server world, Linux being ubiquitous to cloud computing, and Valve revolutionizing the Linux gaming space...",
