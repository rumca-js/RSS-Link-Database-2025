The engine runs just fine, and the seats are as luxurious as you could imagine. But wouldn\u2019t you feel cheated if you couldn\u2019t go anywhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the 16 iterations of the Surface Pro adopt the same double standard: the Surface Pro is a laptop, except when Microsoft starts talking price. Then, poof! It\u2019s a tablet. Only as you move step by step through the buying process does Microsoft reveal that, yes, the pen and keyboard \u2014 and now the charger! \u2014 all cost extra. Ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we\u2019ve come to accept this behavior. Microsoft seems to think that after deciding upon a $2,000 Surface laptop, you might shrug your shoulders and accept a few hundred dollars more. Why not? You\u2019re already hooked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www",
