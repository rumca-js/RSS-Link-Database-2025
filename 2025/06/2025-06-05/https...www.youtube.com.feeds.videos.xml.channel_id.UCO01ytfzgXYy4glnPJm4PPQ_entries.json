        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, you may remember the fake \u201ckids in cages\u201d controversy during the first Trump administration. The media panicked over Trump housing unaccompanied illegal alien children in detainment facilities. The Biden Administration pledged not to use these facilities. Well, now we know what they did with these children instead, and it\u2019s truly horrifying. Also, Pete Hegseth announces that Harvey Milk\u2019s name will be taken off of a Navy ship. And Sesame Street hasn\u2019t gotten the memo that everyone is tired of Pride Month theatrics.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:29 Opening\n02:33 - 14:07 How Biden\u2019s Border Policy Turned Into A Child Trafficking Operation\n16:49 - 29:42 The Left Attempts To Erase History By Renaming Navy Ships\n29:42 - 33:13 Deputy Cleared of Charges After Being Accused of Assaulting Trans-Identified Male\n33:14 - 46:20 Gen Z Becomes More Religious Than Previous Generations\n48:23 - 58:33 Everyone Who Continues To Push Pride Month Propaganda Is Canceled\n\nEp.1609\n\nSou",
