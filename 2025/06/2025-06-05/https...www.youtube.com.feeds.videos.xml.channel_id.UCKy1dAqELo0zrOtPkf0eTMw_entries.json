        "description": "The World of John Wick gets a little bit bigger with Ballerina, starring Ana de Armas as a vengeful assassin from the Ruska Roma. Spinoffs are a tricky thing to pull off, especially when the franchise is as iconic and beloved as John Wick. But de Armas' Eve goes toe to toe with the Baba Yaga himself and proves that this Ballerina truly belongs in The World of John Wick.\n\nStarring Ana de Armas, Keanu Reeves, Gabriel Byrne and Norman Reedus, check out Ballerina in theaters on June 6 and let us know what you think about it in the comments!",
