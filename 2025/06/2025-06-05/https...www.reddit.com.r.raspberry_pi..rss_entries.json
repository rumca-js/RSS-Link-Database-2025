Not on fresh image burn or already configured device. It creates a user it changes a host name but than nothing. When I conected keybord I figure out that there is no wlan0 if I run ifconfig. But I can get it up by runing sudo rfkill unblock wifi and sudo ifconfig wlan0 up. After that I only need to run sudo ifconfig wlan0 up to turn on after restart.

I&#39;m very, very happy with the result. I think Raspberry Pi is really amazing and i don&#39;t think i will use anythinng never (or at least the time Pi exists). I initially was interested on using Firefox, but i have realise it is quite laggy and not as responsive as chromium. So, i think i&#39;m switching to use Chromium. </p> <p>My issue is, i&#39;m dyslexic and the huge fonts of the ui feels really wrong and almost unusable. I know this is a common issue on Linux, and one of the reasons i have never use Chromium. But maybe, someone knows how to change this. I have make some trys with fontconfig and so, whith no results. </p> <p>thx you all, anyways. Raspberry Pi OS, continues to be amazing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Calaat\"> /u/Ca",
