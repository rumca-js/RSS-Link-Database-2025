Obviously Schedule One isn\u2019t going to run great with onboard graphics so I\u2019ve got it on medium quality and turned off all the anti-aliasing, god rays bs. </p> <p>Normally I\u2019d attribute issues to the shitty graphics but it seems that the game is mostly responsive and loads well. However, I\u2019ve got this weird bug where the longer I press W to run, once I release it, I carry on running for up to ten seconds, and can\u2019t stop or press other keys. </p> <p>Otherwise, button presses occur fairly quickly, just are really sticky if I\u2019ve held them a long time. I\u2019ve read that this might be to do with Proton and the way Steam virtualises Windows games via Wine.</p> <p>Apart from buying a new laptop (no can do) ",

I am using Linux 100% of the time on this machine, and I do play casual games like Warframe or ETS 2, etc. </p> <p>People say AMD is better but upscaling tech is better on Nvidia side. I know people hate AI stuff, but it is not going away, so might choose the best option? No? Also Nvidia reflex is available on linux while AMD anti-lag is not as far as I know. Also, Cuda cores to run basic models locally? What are your opinions?

Is there any alternative on Linux to retrobat on windows? A more full emulation station install instead of barebones ES-DE? I know batocera is a thing but that would involve running a vm with passthrough or reimaging or waiting on someone to containerize it. All the lines I&#39;m seeing seem to be only controllable via the steam deck with radial menus, so no as easy for controller use without the need of a supplemental keyboard/mouse to help facilitate navigation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sirchacha\"> /u/Sirchacha </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1l3x81l/retrobat_alternative/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"h",

The guide below lists everything from the hardware used, to how to install and make the base game work with Proton 5.0, and then Proton GE, to the Modding, Public Online and LAN tabs. What encouraged me to make this guide was mainly the LAN tab in CM, which is broken in Linux. It doesn&#39;t work, and I didn&#39;t see anyone talking about it. I managed to find a way to get around it, and it&#39;s even functional, making it possible to play with Windows users!

With the 9060XT launching today, I was wondering if it&#39;s worth switching to get better dx12 performance? I did see that Nvidia now <a href=\"https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/279\">actually</a> knows about vkd3d being worse on Linux, so maybe it&#39;s better to wait and see; with the way things are though I&#39;m concerned the card is going to be selling for more than it&#39;s worth in a week&#39;s time. Apart from that it only seems like a small upgrade (if you ignore the vram).

Im currently rocking a 7900xt, which i really enjoy. But im also looking at the 9070xt for the slight performance lift and FSR4. Im watching benchmarks that come out and they seem to show that 9070xt isnt getting even what a 7900xt gets on Linux atm. Nor matching Windows 11.

Yesterday i bought a gaming laptop. before buying the laptop i always had a thought of dual booting Linux and windows, but after using the windows 11, i realized it&#39;s unusable. So i am gonna completely switch to Linux. I only play single player games and i hate games like fortnite,valo and apex. So gaming is not an issue but choosing an distro is.actually i like arch linux ricing and the cool stuff i can do but it seems like i takes some time to learn or even use. i am gonna dual boot arch and any other user friendly distro. do the gaming performance game change according to the distro we choose? most of them says that linux mint is user friendly and nobara is optimized for gaming. which one should i choose mint or nobara? is the performance diff high or negligible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Expensive-Echo-2140\"> /u/Expe",
