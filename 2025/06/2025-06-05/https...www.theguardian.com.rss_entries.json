You can hardly blame the union for trying to capitalise on the hype but there are better examples of players who epitomise the strengths of the second tier.</p><p>None more so than James Williams, Bristol\u2019s inside-centre who at 28 has taken the road less travelled to the Premiership semi-finals. Williams began his career at Birmingham Moseley in National League One before moving to Hartpury. He joined Worcester in 2018 but managed just one appearance, signed with Sale a year later and appeared just three times and when Covid hit he was released by the Sharks.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/bristol-bears-class-div",

You may think, as I did, you\u2019re not interested in this, but hold up. A recent excerpt in the Daily Mail from How Not to Be a Political Wife, Vine\u2019s forthcoming memoir, contained not only the suggestion that Brexit ruined their marriage, but that a key trigger in its collapse was Andrea Leadsom\u2019s political manoeuvring. Has Andrea Leadsom ruined any of your relationships? It is certainly a question worth asking.</p><p>Or more broadly: do people really break up with each other because of big-P politics?
