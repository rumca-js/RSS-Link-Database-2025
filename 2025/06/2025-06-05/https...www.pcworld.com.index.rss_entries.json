Who wants to stay tethered to a wall outlet when you can comfortably work from wherever you want? That\u2019s why you need a laptop like the Acer Swift Go 14, and now\u2019s an excellent time to snag one because it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1884948-REG/acer_sfg14_73t_78yk_14_swift_go_14.html\">on sale for just $599 at B&H</a> (was $899).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Swift Go 14 is a great daily driver with decent specs, running on an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor and 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM. That\u2019s enough power to handle Windows 11 and several apps and browser tabs without struggling, and it\u2019s topped off with a 512GB SSD that offers enough space for apps and documents while also ensuring fast system boot times and quick app launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s the battery th",

They\u2019re slow to charge, slow to transfer data, inconveniently short, and poorly made so they die fast. None of that is an issue with Anker\u2019s cables, and with this sale the price is still good. At 6 feet long, you can doomscroll on your bed while plugged in to charge, and at 100W of charging power, your phone will be recharged from zero to full in about an hour or less.
