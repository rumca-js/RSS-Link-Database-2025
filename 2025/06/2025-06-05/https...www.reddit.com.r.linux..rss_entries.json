To elaborate, I want to make my pc have a Frutiger aero aesthetic about it. I found this github link <a href=\"https://github.com/diinki/diinki-aero\">https://github.com/diinki/diinki-aero</a> in order to set up my operating system to have the aesthetic but I need Arch Linux. I heard linux mint, debian, and red hat were much easier to use however. Can I install these easier versions and still have the github aesthetic work or does it only work for Arch Linux? And if so, where can I learn to use Arch Linux. I&#39;ve used Linux before to code in C and used a debugger within in it, however it was only within the bash terminal and I wasn&#39;t told what distro it was. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Brave_Tip3740\"> /u/Brave_Tip3740 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",
