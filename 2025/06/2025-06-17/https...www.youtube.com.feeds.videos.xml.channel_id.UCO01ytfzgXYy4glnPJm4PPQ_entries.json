        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, why is a confessed child killer about to walk free in Oregon, even after being convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his crime? We\u2019ll talk about the latest case that shows how leftist radicals have destroyed the justice system and the country along with it. Also, the Trump Administration has apparently abandoned plans to give amnesty to illegal aliens who work for farms and hotels, which is great news. And, the more we hear about the assassination of those politicians in Minnesota, the less the story makes sense. We'll talk about the latest. Plus, with the summer comes more viral videos of the bizarre, disturbing creatures known as \u201cDisney adults.\u201d \n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:35 Opening\n01:55 - 20:16 LGBT Judge Lets Child Killer Walk Free in SHOCKING Court Decision\n21:30 - 26:20 Trump Reverses ICE Exemption For Farms, Hotels, And Meatpackers\n26:21 - 35:13 FBI Releases Statement On Minnesota Shooting Suspect\n35:14 - 40:20 Chicago Mayor Plans To Hand ",
