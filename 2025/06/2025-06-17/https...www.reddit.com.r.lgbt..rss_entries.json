For it I looked to other trans artists for inspiration. Those being Laurence Philomene and Sam Avery. But I&#39;m always looking for more artists to follow and be inspired by. Do any of y&#39;all know any other good artists that focus heavily on lgbtq+ media? Can be drawing, photo, sculpture, really any form of art you could think of. I want to know all of them :&gt;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MayoManCity\"> /u/MayoManCity </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ldp6wy/favorite_lgbtq_artists/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ldp6wy/favorite_lgbtq_artists/\">[comments]</a></span>",
