And even though Formula is kinda right there in the title, is F1 a little too devoted to the sports movie format?",

But I also don't have any great praise to heap upon it. Nearly across the board \u2013 from combat, to music, to writing, to area design \u2013 it competently gets the job done and calls it a centicycle. It may just become the seven out of ten game I think of in the coming years when someone wants a really good example of a seven out of ten game. And for what it's worth, that means I had a decently good time with it. In a world of bloated, hundred-plus-hour, obscenely high-budget collectathons, I think a Tron: Catalyst here and there is a nice, restrained palate cleanser. But it does leave me with the vaguely unsatisfied feeling that I wanted it to be a bit more, especially with its rewind mechanic that seemed like it could\u2019ve been something special.",

As you probably know, the response to the original Death Stranding was varied to say the least, so I thought it would be helpful to provide a bit of context regarding my own feelings about the 2019 sci-fi epic before hearing my thoughts on the sequel when the review embargo drops on June 23rd.\nI didn\u2019t review Death Stranding for IGN \u2013 that was the job of the excellent Tristan Ogilvie, and you can read his thoughts here. His score of 6.8 isn\u2019t anywhere close to the most negative assessment Death Stranding received at launch, but it\u2019s also far from the glowing praise some others bestowed upon it. Opinions are inherently subjective, especially when it comes to art, so naturally my thoughts on Death Stranding differ from Tristan's, albeit not by too much. This is not a re-review, so you won\u2019t get a different score here, but let me explain what I did and didn\u2019t like about the original.",
