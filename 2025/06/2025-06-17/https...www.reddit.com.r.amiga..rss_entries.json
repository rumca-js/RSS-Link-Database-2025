        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In my opinion, in regards to gaming, the Commodore Amiga (OCS and AGA) did/does not hold up against the Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive, other than PC type games (simulators, strategy, point and click, ect) that require a mouse and keyboard. But when it comes to arcade, action, platform, run and gun, shooters, and RPG type games, the consoles win hands down with better quality titles with usually better graphics, but equal sound quality (except with the Mega Drive&#39;s sound chip.) Also, one button (rarely two button) controls wasn&#39;t good for 16/32 bit era gaming (aside from the obvious CD32).</p> <p>With That being said, it was obviously considerably cheaper building a game library for an Amiga than a console 30+ years ago (largely due to piracy), and the Amiga can do a lot more than just load games, obviously. It should also be mentioned that some great Amiga made games got console ports too.</p> <p>What&#39;s everyone&#39;s opinions on this",
