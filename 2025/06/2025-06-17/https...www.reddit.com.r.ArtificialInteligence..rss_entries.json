I can\u2019t stop thinking about what\u2019ll happen if we discover AGI that transforms into ASI and going Skynet or throwing us into a new era where we have to reassess what our purpose is as humans is frankly terrifying to me. Even the idea of jobs becoming automated by a narrow AI (or its subsequent evolutions) and not ever having to work again scares me, because I sort of like going to work. The world is just getting crazy, like endless entropy or some shit. </p> <p>And I\u2019ve read here and there that LLMs might not necessarily be capable of developing into AGI, and that there\u2019s a chance that we\u2019re still far off from even having AGI, but I still can\u2019t help but feel a pit in my stomach whenever I think about it.

Candela, who joined OpenAI last year as head of preparedness and previously led AI efforts at Facebook, said the company is under intense pressure to grow. As competition from companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Instacart, and Meta heats up, OpenAI has been growing quickly, adding important people like Fidji Simo, CEO of Instacart, and buying Jony Ive&#39;s AI hardware startup. Candela\u2019s goal is to help build a strong, mission-focused team as OpenAI continues its push toward advanced AI.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
