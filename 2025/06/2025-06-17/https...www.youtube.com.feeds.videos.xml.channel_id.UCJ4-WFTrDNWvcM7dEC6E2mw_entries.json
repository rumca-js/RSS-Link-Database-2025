        "description": "We aim to celebrate this milestone with you! During this stream we hope to hit 500,000 subscribers live while we play a game of Warhammer 40,000. This celebratory live stream (hopefully) will include giveaways of merch, shenanigans from the warp due to some kind of wheel, and dedicated time for some questions and answers. \n\nJoin us for this milestone event and learn more about the team that brings you 40k in 40m and more. \n\nMerchandise giveaways from Leveled Up Merchandising will happen throughout the stream. https://merch.playontabletop.com/ and, there will also be a discount on Play On merch (code coming soon). \n\nThere will also be a membership drive as we want more people to join our Discord and watch our exclusive content. Currently, things are heating up in our Crusade series as we move into the second half of the campaign.\n\nPlay On!",
