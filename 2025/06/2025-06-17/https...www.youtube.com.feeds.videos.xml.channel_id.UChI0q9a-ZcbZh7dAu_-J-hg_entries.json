        "description": "After seeing a dramatic rise in the amount of advertising a certain \"metaverse\" project was doing on YouTube... I wanted to discuss the insidious nature of what this application pretends to offer, and showcase that sometimes \"free\" doesn't mean free. \n\nSpending hundreds of hours of your time, glued to a screen watching advertisements for literal pennies on the dollar is not financial liberation, or even beneficial. If the return on investment is intentionally crippled, and purpose of the application is to simply make you waste your life watching ads... maybe its not actually a good thing. \n\nNot to mention the fact that the business model is dubious at best. Be careful of Atlas Earth.\n\n\n\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\n",
