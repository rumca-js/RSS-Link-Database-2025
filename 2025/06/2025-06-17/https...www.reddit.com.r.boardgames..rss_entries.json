I did not think much of it later.</p> <p>But then, one day i was bored, and thought of searching for some board games and I was blown away by the sheer number of board games, and the maddening intricate game types, and the people! I have never been so excited to want to be part of this community.</p> <p>I am 40 and growing up we had monopoly, ludo, scrabble, and chess. 7 or 8 years back I played sequence. That&#39;s about it.

The grail rules state that you have to discard it once the protagonist with the grail companion hits 0 life. I understand that he returns to 150 life. However, my friend says he found somewhere that the holy grail if used properly just wins you the game regardless of standings? His only evidence was ChatGPT which should go to show how he\u2019s being foolish, but I\u2019m convinced that the grail doesn\u2019t just give you extra life. So here is my two big questions on this. </p> <ol> <li>Does the holy grail after being used end the game since the rules of the game state that: \u201cwhen a player dies, the player with the most life wins\u201d </li> <li>Does the holy grail if used just win you the game? If this is correct:</li> <li>Is there a specified way to use the grail to win that is not explained properly? It doesn\u2019t seem right to have a character who just says: \u201ccompl",
