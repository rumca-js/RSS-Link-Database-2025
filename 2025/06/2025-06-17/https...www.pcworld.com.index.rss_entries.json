Normally $30, you can get it now for $10 off!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot I love about this neat little charging cable. First of all, it delivers 30W of charging power, which is pretty darn fast for the cigarette lighter outlet in your car. Most built-in car USB ports don\u2019t even get that fast! It\u2019s also retractable with a length up to 31.5 inches, so it\u2019s convenient for charging <em>and</em> conveniently tucks away when not in use. That length is long enough for backseat passengers to charge their stuff, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But tha",

Not only do you get a live remote feed, but you also get to chat with them via two-way audio. So, if you\u2019re not home and have to give the delivery person instructions on where to leave your package, you can do that through your phone.
