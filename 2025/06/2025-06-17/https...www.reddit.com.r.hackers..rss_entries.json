Ransomware completely takes over companies computers and systems, giving the hackers full access to the companies internals. </p> <p>I can only image what these hackers would be able to do once they are in.

If they don\u2019t pay, brick the site then show them it\u2019s retrievable, you could even have a heart and after you brick the site be like; sorry man, I don\u2019t mean to do this to you but I gotta teach you a business ",
