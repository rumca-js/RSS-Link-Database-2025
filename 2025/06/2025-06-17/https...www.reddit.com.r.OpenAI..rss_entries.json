I need a GDPR compliant alternative, what\u2019s the best solution where I wouldn\u2019t be rate limited ? Need to parse long text documents with it on a scale of around every 10 seconds for a day or two, then on a request basis after that.ideally looking for a solution that\u2019s not crazy expensive, if possible. I\u2019ve seen azure seems like a decent alternative, I\u2019m curious how well it would handle such volume of requests? Would I be waiting on red tape like with AWS ?
