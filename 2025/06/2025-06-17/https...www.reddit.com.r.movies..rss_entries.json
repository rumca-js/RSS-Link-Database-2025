I dont know how to describe it but theres so many thinga horrific about that damn scene. There was violence but that wasnt the scary part about it. Its like the build up of the scene and his fucking stare that mostly freaked me out. You cant even see his pupils. Its like he wasnt human anymore. Though there was some humor in the scene where the drill instructor started insulting him lmao. But that doesn&#39;t take away from the horrors of that one scene. Its so well directed.
