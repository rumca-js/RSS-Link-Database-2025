That was the year the late Rob Ford, then mayor of Toronto, was reported to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/rob-ford-crack-video-release\">filmed smoking crack cocaine</a>. He denied it, twisting the allegations into what he suggested was a smear campaign by an untrustworthy, left-leaning mainstream media.

Since retiring as a French teacher, Lars has been sitting around at home, steadily more depressed and frail. Hammar wants to show his dad that life is worth living. But as you\u2019d expect from a documentary this heart-warming, Hammar has a lesson or two to learn himself.</p><p>For the trip, Hammar has bought a knackered old Renault 4, the same car the family had when he was a kid.

It was July 2020; people were doing stranger things with their first pandemic summer. But given that she had read a newspaper article about a couple who\u2019d raffled their house in the morning, and had put her own up for sale by the evening, the scepticism was well-founded. \u201cAt first, I wanted nothing to do with it,\u201d says Bradley, a 38-year-old carpenter. It didn\u2019t help that she had also chucked the family car in the draw for good measure.</p><p>Still, Natalie, 38, a teaching assistant, persevered. She printed out leaflets and put them up all over Salford and Manchester, set up social media accounts to promote the draw and bought a big poster to hang in the couple\u2019s driveway.</p> <a href=\"htt",
