My requirements are not that crazy just browser that does not eat my whole RAM and CPU resources with clean interfaces with decent developer tools (I am a web developer) with bitwarden extension support (and ublock if there is no built-in option like in brave) that just works. In span of a year I tried Chrome, Edge, Arc and Brave browser but each of them had its own issues.</p> <p>Chrome</p> <p>Well I think I dont have to say much about negatives here the resource used by chrome are just mindblowing sometimes (Yes I used sleeping tabs). And also its UI and the browser itself is bloated by google on all fronts.</p> <p>Edge</p> <p>I actually enjoyed Edge with few tweaks it has pretty much clean UI but also has a lot of bloat like AI assistant etc. but the dealbreaker here was YouTube the videos are laggy even on my PC which has Ryzen 5 7500F, 32GB DDR5 and RX 675",

While trying to import backup from desktop, it was showing a file not supported error. Then I realized that I have installed two different extensions. So before I stick to one, want to know which one do you prefer? Is one more prone to bugs historically?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Every_Pass_226\"> /u/Every_Pass_226 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1ld9z61/tabliss_or_bonjour_which_one_you_prefer_i_cant/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1ld9z61/tabliss_or_bonjour_which_one_you_prefer_i_cant/\">[comments]</a></span>",
