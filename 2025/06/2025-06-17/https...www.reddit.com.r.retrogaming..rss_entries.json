It centers on 2 of the biggest games companies from back then - Ocean Software and Imagine Games - as they try to get the all important Christmas number 1 game.</p> <p>Funnily enough, 1984 is when we got our first home computer - a Spectrum 48K. I have fond memories of both Ocean and Imagine, so thoroughly enjoyed watching this show. Hope some of you enjoy it too. </p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/buuUZFh_pyk\">https://youtu.be/buuUZFh_pyk</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/daddy-dj\"> /u/daddy-dj </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1le0ykb/bbc_documentary_from_1984_on_ocean_software_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1le0ykb/bbc_documentary_from_1984_on_ocean_software_and/\">[comments]</a></sp",

From what I can remember there were levels and you would start in a cave. Your egective was to collect coloured keys (and possible gold?) and find the matching doors to those keys. I can&#39;t remember any other things you could collect in the game. I also remember there being ladders and there were some spiders that you&#39;d have to be careful with and snakes. And possible bats? I remember you could get stuck in spider webs. I think I remember one of the levels being outside in winter. Or atleast it was icy and blue. </p> <p>This was played on a PC and I think it couldve been a browser game. </p> <p>Some similar games was Spelunky.
