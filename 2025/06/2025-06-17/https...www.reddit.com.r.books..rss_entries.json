The language he uses to describe the city and its people is often dehumanizing. The protagonist\u2019s Western lens veers from na\u00efvet\u00e9 into outright revulsion, and the narrative never really challenges that perspective. Calcutta isn\u2019t just a city, it\u2019s the actual monster of the story.</p> <p>But man, I\u2019ll admit I was engrossed. Simmons builds dread like a master!

I\u2019ve read Dirt Creek and really liked it. Her writing is very good, in my opinion, and she\u2019s able to keep the reader guessing and suspicious. This book started off well I thought, had some whodunit aspects to it. But then the ending was just very abrupt. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting. Looking for other people\u2019s opinions.

My mind always went to the children&#39;s books on tape that I had growing up where the narrator always seemed to read the material like it was a dishwasher manual. I used them to pass the time during an hour commute. To be honest, if I hadn\u2019t listened to those audiobooks, I would\u2019ve never discovered some amazing books and authors, or made a dent in my &quot;to be read&quot; list.</p> <p>So now, I\u2019m curious: Does anyone have particular favorites; whether it\u2019s because of the story itself, the narrator, or something else? Here are a few of mine:</p> <p><em>I&#39;m Glad My Mom Died</em> by Jenette McCurdy, read by the author. </p> <p>Hearing Jennette tell her own story added so much emotional depth. It was powerful and heart-breaking at the same time. There were moments when you could tell certain passages were especially difficult for her, and you could hear",

Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to my family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak.
