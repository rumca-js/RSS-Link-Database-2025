By looking around I discovered that I could use cloudflare tunnels to host a site without needing port forwarding, and I decided to do so. I created the site, the tunnel and bought a domain, but here comes the problem: I used xampp for hosting both the db and the webserver ( myslq and apache ) and set up a virtual host in apache to connect it to the tunnel without needing to use localhost, but when I tried <a href=\"http://sub.domain.org/phpmyadmin\">sub.domain.org/phpmyadmin</a> I got access to the db instantly, from the ouside.</p> <p>So I ask you, as I don&#39;t have any experience: how can I host a site using cloudflare tunnels but expose only the site and not other things like the db? If needed I&#39;ll change the webserver ecc.. that&#39;s not a problem. ( the website uses php )</p",
