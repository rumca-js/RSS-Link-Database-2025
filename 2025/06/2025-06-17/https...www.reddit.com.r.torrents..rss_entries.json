I\u2019m also a stickler for quality so try and get 4K DV or HDR whenever possible. </p> <p>Just curious though as to why I typically see Italian dubbed versions of American made movies come out first so consistently? The movie itself will be an English movie yet I may have to wait hours, or even days, for the 4K English file to be posted while the Italian version leaked out days prior. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me that foreign language versions are made so much faster than the English version when the movie is made in English. Is there a reason for this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dubbs919\"> /u/Dubbs919 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1le0oqw/why_do_italian_dubbed_videos_beat_out_english/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So basically I wanted to play games for free and found out about torrenting and stuff. So in january i downloaded a hella games from fitgirl using utorrent web, without a vpn. My isp is spectrum. And i got a notice after downloading the new assasins creed game. But the other games like hitman and ghost of tsushima were not detected. I also downloaded assetto corsa competizione from fitgirl. When i downloaded ACC again without a vpn, i didnt get a notice.</p> <p>So I deleted the torrent accidentally and i downloaded assetto corsa competizione from fitgirl using utorrent web again today at 10am without a vpn(forgot to turn it on). It had 30 peers active at that time. Since the game was released 11 years ago i dont think the company will care about people pirating it. I still have not got a notice from my isp, spectrum. Am i in the clear or am i cooked?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Eternal_Zenith_",
