A sweeping new study dives deep into how ultra-heavy particles behave after these high-energy collisions, revealing they don t just vanish after the initial impact but continue interacting like silent messengers from the dawn of time. This behavior, once overlooked, may hold the key to unraveling the universe s most mysterious beginnings.",
