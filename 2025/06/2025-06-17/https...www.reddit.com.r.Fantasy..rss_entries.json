Donaldson, including a review quote from one of the Malazan books, so I looked into the series. Read the first 3 paragraphs of the plot summary for the first book, immediately felt like an edgy fantasy/isekai (anime) 40+ years before they were so common. Those paragraphs read exactly who ep 1 would, getting a bunch of controversy, but also getting a loyal fanbase. I wonder if there&#39;s Japanese artist has ever credited Donaldson for inspiration.</p> <p>Thank you for indulging my random thoughts, here&#39;s the wiki link.</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Foul%27s_Bane\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Foul%27s_Bane</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucacanuck\"> /u/Lucacanuck </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1le1o9p/thomas_covenant/\">[link]</a>",
