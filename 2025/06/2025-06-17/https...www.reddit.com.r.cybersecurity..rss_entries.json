In that time I\u2019ve handled about 1,024 security alerts but I screwed up today for I think the 3rd time. I improperly handled an incident bc I accidentally overlooked a log entry and my manager caught it pretty quick and brought me into a call to tell me it was gross negligence on my part (which I won\u2019t deny as I should have looked at more than just the last week of logs). As I said, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve made a mistake and I\u2019m really scared that they are going to fire me (idk why I have a mental image of three strikes and you\u2019re out). In all 3 mistakes I usually spend the next week going at about half the speed I usually do bc I\u2019m so paranoid. So my question is how do yall handle alerts so quickly while minimizing mistakes and how do you handle the inevitable mistakes that DO happen?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cau",

If there is an alert we evaluate as True Positive, we escalate and inform the customer. But we dont work on the customers network outside of the SIEM. So I thought triage + opening a ticket is bascially L1 monitoring. </p> <p>But if we do some actual in depth analysis before escalating, isnt that already L2? We also do reports and suggest actions to take for incidents.</p> <p>I am not sure if this is even useful to differentiate, but when I am sitting in a job interview for example, I dont want to undersell my skills or what I am doing lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Smort01\"> /u/Smort01 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ldl03p/soc_analysts_ho",
