I want to use a 4&quot; 720x720 screen, and am looking at this one as it&#39;s quite thin, and would be suitable. I&#39;m unsure though if it will work with the rpi0 2w. If it does, will I need a power boost module and I assume an adapter(s). And if it won&#39;t work do y&#39;all have any suggestions that fit this criteria?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Born_Refrigerator672\"> /u/Born_Refrigerator672 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ak0hmqzdod7",
