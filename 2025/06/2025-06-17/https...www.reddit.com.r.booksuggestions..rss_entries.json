So, I wanna read up on how writers/artists have envisioned this time period ahead of time before it became a thing like today&#39;s times. Right now all I know that is relative is warhammer 40k, but they have so many different books and I am unfamiliar with the Universe in general so I wouldn&#39;t know where to begin, I don&#39;t really wanna read much about the chapters or anything more so just engagements that speak about how they dealt with pro-human/pro-ai. Same for other books outside of 40k, really focus on the writings that extensively deal with pro-human vs pro-a.i.</p> <p>thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/First_Seed_Thief\"> /u/First_Seed_Thief </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ldyt4z/im_looking_for_prohuman_vs_proai_society_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",

And after surfing the whole internet I found out two books which would be a fit for me, first one is &quot;A Court Of Thorns And Roses&quot; By Sarah J.

I love her writing style, the way she portrays fear is so realistic and it makes you feel like you too \u2014 just like the characters in her book \u2014 are in danger. I could go on and on all day about why I love her stories so I\u2019ll stop there. But that sense of impending doom and darkness was great in this book! The atmosphere and tone was bleak. </p> <p>This is NOT a spoiler but I went into this book a little worried as we find out very early on who dies. The book is a matter of solving the who and why which is different from her other stories. I ended up loving this set up because as the story went on and the threat is clearly closing in on the victims I kept holding out hope that they\u2019d somehow survive, only to be reminded of their fate.

Contemporary setting is a high preference, but definitely not a deal breaker (setting should at least resemble the real world somewhat, regardless of time period). Would be cool to have some elements of horror, but not against anything light-hearted.</p> <p>The only other thing I&#39;m trying to avoid would be tragic endings.

I&#39;d love to read about characters who are struggling with finding their purpose, figuring out their career paths, or just generally feeling adrift after school/university. Whether there&#39;s a strong romance subplot or no romance at all, I&#39;m open to anything as long as it fits the &quot;finding yourself&quot; vibe. Hit me with your best suggestions!

Similarly that royal person has some of their own problems and reciprocates the love for some reason. To be frank, this seems like a stereotypical trope but I don\u2019t know any titles. The characters can be of any sexuality and I prefer things geared towards young adults but I don\u2019t mind reading more mature things. </p> <p>If you don\u2019t have anything with that, you could also recommend something with magic and royalty existing, but preferably magic exists as something some people have and some don\u2019t.

I haven&#39;t sat and read and book in ages and even in highschool a lot of the school chosen stories never interested me enough to ever actually finish. I think I&#39;d prefer stories that are female focused, fantasy (I love good world building), lesbian, and maybe a comedic monster romance.

Essentially, I want a book narrated by a character/characters who reframe events in a variety of ways to shield themselves and the audience from the reality of who they are, the horrible things they&#39;ve done, and why they&#39;ve done them, especially through the lens of an overtly kind of horrible main character. Lolita is probably the closest to what I&#39;m looking for in literature, in that what we&#39;re reading is basically a laundry list of flimsy justifications and deceptive account of Humbert&#39;s sexual abuse of Dolores, framed to make him a wounded romantic hero rather than a pathetic monstrous nonce, but since reading it, I&#39;ve found it remarkably diffic",
