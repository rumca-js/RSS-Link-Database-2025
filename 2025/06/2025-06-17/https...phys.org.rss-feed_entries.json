However, the small crustaceans are increasingly targeted as part of a growing fishing industry, which has significant consequences for the entire Southern Ocean ecosystem. Therefore, ways to minimize the negative effects of fishing on the krill themselves and on the animals that feed on them are urgently needed.",
