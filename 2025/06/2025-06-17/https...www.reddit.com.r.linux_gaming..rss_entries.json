Very subtle stutters, but CS2 players know we need it flawless.

I think using the distro package version (dnf/rpm) would prevent those but I was wondering how the transition from flatpak to system package would go. Will it be able to keep games and data files and re-use them with the other version, does it delete everything or will it keep files but not use them because they don&#39;t use the same path ? What is the cleanest way to transition ?
