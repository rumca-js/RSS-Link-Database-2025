Sometimes they did. Sometimes they ghosted. Sometimes <em>I</em> forgot to even follow up.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t even about big money. I just wanted to feel like I wasn\u2019t constantly chasing loose change or wondering who owed me what. And as dumb as it sounds, every time I sent an invoice I felt like I was winging it\u2014like I was pretending to be a \u201creal\u201d freelancer.</p> <p>Eventually, out of pure frustration, I ended up building a little tool for myself\u2014something super simple that just helped me send clean invoices and track what\u2019s paid, what\u2019s not.

My partner&#39;s building alone, and it\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve got 7+ years in planning and management, so I tried helping him streamline his goals and execution. It worked\u2026 kinda. Turns out, I\u2019m too close to be objective.</p> <p>But when we brought in a calm outsider with a structured approach, it was a game-changer - focus, progress, clarity.</p> <p>That got me thinking: what if I help other solo founders like you? I\u2019m offering <strong>free accountability partner help</strong> to early-stage founders who want to cut through the noise and stay on track. Not a coach. Not a co-founder. Just support - structured, human, quiet, to execute what matters.</p> <p><strong>What You Get</strong>:</p>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, we are very confused\u2026</p> <p>A few of my developer friends and me have been constantly stuck in the loop of thinking of starting an agency and never doing anything about it or building a project but having no ideas. We are split into multiple fields, like I am into marketing and sales funnel creation, while the other is into automation and AI and the third has been doing web prototyping and shopify development along with SEO since his teenage days. Looking for advice as to how to start any of the two things above.</p> <p>If we could also help anyone out here with any of the above services at cheaper rates than what the market offers, we would love to!</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LyKaN30\"> /u/LyKaN30 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ldh7sr/agency_side_project_confused/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

It felt like everyone was on a different systems so we just defaulted to text or email. Some were on Slack, others on Teams, and many on Webex \u2013 all dictated by <em>their</em> company&#39;s IT policies. It was a constant struggle to keep track of conversations, and true collaboration felt impossible.</p> <p>That frustration led my team and me to build WorkChat.fun. We designed it to be a truly platform-agnostic workchat solution. The idea is simple: as long as you and your contact have an account, you can chat, regardless of what your respective companies use or dictate. No more juggling multiple apps just to reach your partners!</p> <p>We&#39;re now looking for folks to test <a href=\"http://WorkChat.fun\"><strong>WorkChat.fun</strong></a> and give us feedback. If you&#39;re a seller, distributor, or anyone",
