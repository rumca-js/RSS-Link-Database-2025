Not only does he have the qualities of an entitled rich kid, he is also deluded, strange, manipulative, and quite evil. There are some moments that show his softer side, though, such as in holding the fmc\u2019s hand or laying his head in her lap. Even though I didn\u2019t find the plot of the book to be very interesting (unfortunately I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a dark academia girlie), I was gnawing at the bars of my enclosure for every little bit of Henry that I got.
