But, in nearly all of the board game spaces I&#39;m in, there&#39;s basically no discussion about SETI since.</p> <p>I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m biased because, I bought SETI after the golden geeks, and while I thought it was okay, I was kind of surprised at how mundane the game felt. Kind of a &quot;is this really it?&quot; feeling. It felt like I was exploring new alien species, but it definitely didn&#39;t feel like I was exploring original board game ideas.</p> <p>But then again, it&#39;s shot up to #46 on BGG and is currently ranked as #5 on hotness.

On a player\u2019s turn, they can choose to ignore the group\u2019s recommendations, or they can just execute the group\u2019s plan.

They&#39;re mostly even, but I do have the highest win rate in the group. Not by a huge margin, but enough for me to be the &quot;guy to beat,&quot; which is totally fine and fun.</p> <p>I&#39;m also the guy in the group who cares the least <em>about</em> winning. If he hadn&#39;t tracked it, I couldn&#39;t have told you who won the games last week, let alone for the last 18 months.
