Firstly im using A Pi nano 2W but also have tried running this on a 3b+ with no luck. using Debian 12.0</p> <p>I have installed and got working This fellas program. <a href=\"https://github.com/Timendus/pyro-player\">https://github.com/Timendus/pyro-player</a></p> <p>its just a server to use rpi-rf to fire fireworks. The server runs, it accepts a connection and the server log says its sending the RF codes to hardware. Great.</p> <p>The problem i think is RPI-RF not running or having the correct permissions. RPI-RF should be sending the radio frequency code to pin 17 or GPIO 0. </p> <p>It&#39;s not. I&#39;ve run GPIO readall and its showing All pins as inputs. I dont think RPI-RF is being allowed to set pin 17 to an output which is the data pin for the 433hz transmitter. I&#39;ve run RPI-RF_send to send a code manually in terminal and it says its sent but again nothings coming out of the Pin.</",
