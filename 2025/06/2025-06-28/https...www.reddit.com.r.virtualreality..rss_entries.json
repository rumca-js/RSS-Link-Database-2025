It went to the standalone Quest menu. I restart my PC. I boot up nothing but the Meta Quest Link software. I enable link in my headset. After loading, it sometimes loads the Quest PCVR menu okay. I open up Steam and start up Steam VR when the Quest Link VR menu crashes. It just freezes. Steam VR tells me it doesn&#39;t detect a headset. </p> <p>I have verified the integrity of Steam VR&#39;s files. I have used the &quot;fix&quot; function in the Quest Link software. I don&#39;t understand why I can&#39;t get PCVR to work now. Please someone help. I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to post this.

But there are things I don\u00b4t quite understand yet:</p> <p>Why does the Pimax Crystal Super have higher GPU minimum requirements than the Pimax Crystal light for example? Should you not be able to just lower the resolution of the Super to the same niveau of the PCL and then get a performance boost due to DFR? The PCL needs to render at the same resolution more details in comparison.</p> <p>In my mind the Crystal Super has just a bigger upsite potential.

I\u2019m immediately thinking to get the Big Screen 2, but before I drop \u00a31500 I thought I\u2019d ask advice. I have watched and read reviews but I\u2019m looking for feedback from real people who use this stuff beyond a review.</p> <p>The main issues I have with the Quest is the weight and the visible gap between the two lenses.</p> <p>The weight / doing the band up tight to pull the screen close to get the best optics means after 30 minutes I\u2019m starting to get headaches. Not from motion sickness but from the pressure. I want the optics close as it\u2019s much clearer then but this plus the weight = pressure headaches.</p> <p>The visible dark gap between the two lenses kills the engagement for me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m looking through binoculars that don\u2019t fit me. I\u2019ve changed all the spacing etc but no joy.</p> <p>Also the Meta account is annoying as hell and after every update all the Meta apps re appear",
