Humans have a tendency to appreciate human-made entertainment, and this will never change. The market for human made movies, stories, books, articles, and art will always be there, and AI being good at it doesn&#39;t make any difference. </p> <p>There is this idea that AI will somehow help us generate new ideas, and I totally disagree with it. Deep learning models are very statistically oriented systems which means they are trained on specific data distributions and they are generated based on that distribution. Most of these models are supervised to perform in specific way. In my opinion, the current models and AI techniques don&#39;t have the capacity for such out of no where generation. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ResponsibleCandle585\"> /u/ResponsibleCandle585 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:/",
