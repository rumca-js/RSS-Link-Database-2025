You just send context, and the engine handles it.</p> <p>It\u2019s meant for small tools and indie projects that need smarter user input or internal search without wiring up a full LLM pipeline.</p> <p>Some of the fun challenges I hit: \u2022Designing a schema that works well across apps with different content formats \u2022Letting users switch between user-level and app-level context on the fly \u2022Keeping it lightweight enough for front-end devs to adopt quickly</p> <p>Would love thoughts on implementation approaches, tradeoffs, or other use cases people think are interesting.</p> <p>As a side note, I\u2019m running a small hackathon for it from July 11 to 13.
