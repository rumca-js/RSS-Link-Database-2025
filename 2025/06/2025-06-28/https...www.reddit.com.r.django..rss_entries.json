I was taught some Django at university, but it was a basic CRUD application, nothing advanced. I have been spending a year or so since to improve on my Django knowledge and become more proficient in it. I have created several high-level projects for which I was graded a distinction (first) as part of my university final year project.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong, but I can\u2019t even manage to land an interview even though my skills are strong and well-rounded. So far, I\u2019ve managed to land a single face-to-face task-based assessment at Accenture, but it didn\u2019t take me far. I do aspire to become a back-end developer or a Python developer, but the way things are looking, it discourages me a lot.</p> <p>I am thinking of taking one of my projects and hosting it, and hopefully build a user-base, but surely that\u2019s not necessary or what it takes nowaday",
