While using CachyOS I noticed I get way better performance, and been told its mostly because its Arch based. So was wondering what other Arch based Distro&#39;s out there that are suitable for gaming and easy enough to setup and get going with min issues. My ROG laptop used for gaming I would say about 5% of the time the rest is other stuff, work etc... but for that it doesn&#39;t really matter which Distro just need something reliable and stable. Getting Steam and games to run properly though can be tricky. Bazzite has been running pretty well overall but word on the street Fedora might drop 32bit support and if that happens founder of Bazzite project said he will shut it down. There is no timeline when this will happen or it might not happen at all, just something that&#39;s being discussed, but regardless keen to try another Distro after",

That said, at this point I realize that some aspects are overrated. I have an ASUS laptop that originally came with Windows 10. </p> <p>Since support is ending, I decided to install Linux. Everything went fine at first, but unfortunately, the only game I play &#39;Dark Age of Camelot&#39; not only runs poorly, but also causes the PC to overheat and shut down. </p> <p>Thinking it might just be that game, I installed Steam, and the same thing happened. So yes, Linux is great, and that has to be acknowledged, but it&#39;s definitely not the solution for everyone. Also, I&#39;m not exactly new to the Linux world, so I did everything possible to prevent the issue, from using TLP to CPU_autofreq.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Having issues with Battlefront 2. Using Arch and I have an Nvidia RTX card. I tried to launch the game through Heroic first but that didn&#39;t work. The EA app would launch and I could never get the game itself to launch. I tried Lutris and launching it through the EA app that way, no luck. I tried bottles, both the EA app and Epic Games Launcher, no luck. I tried Epic and EA app through steam with proton directly, no luck. I then even bought the game again on steam since it was cheap and on sale, and again, the EA app launches but the game itself never does. Any ideas how to fix this? I&#39;ve tried proton hotfix, experimental, GE 10.4, GE 9 etc etc. Cant seem to get the game to launch at all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rinnekaton\"> /u/rinnekaton </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lmadkv/issues_with_battlefront_2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href",
