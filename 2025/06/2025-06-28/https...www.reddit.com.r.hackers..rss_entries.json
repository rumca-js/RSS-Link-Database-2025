I want to recreate the multiplayer maps exactly.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem, the game has been shut down, at least the multiplayer. So there is no way for me to join the game to remember what the maps look like.</p> <p>Is there a way to hack the game to create a local lobby for the purpose of checking out what the maps looked like?</p> <p>The game had server powered multiplayer. Is it possible that the maps were only on this server and are nowhere to be found on the game disc? Or is it likely that the game itself has these maps installed on it?</p> <p>Thank you in advance for your replies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoOneBetterMusic\"> /u/NoOneBetterMusic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lmy9hp/would_it_be_possible_to_hack_into_a_game_to/\">[link]<",

Now that dumbass, I wish I called him that in his face, acted so nonchalantly about it like nothing mattered. The hacker drafted an email requesting a ransom, displayed he knew what password we changed the account to, and threatened to leak &quot;sensitive photos&quot;. Whatever, my biggest problem is that it took my father like three fucking days before securing any major accounts tied to that email.</p> <p>Honestly those three days may not have even mattered as I know that information from data center leaks and breaches could&#39;ve been sitting out there forever and his is just now being looked at.</p> <p>To make matters a little worse, we were on the opposite side of the world d",
