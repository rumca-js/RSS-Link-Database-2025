Let me tell you a bit about myself first.<br/> I\u2019ve just finished my first year of a BSc in Cybersecurity. So far, I\u2019ve learned Java, some object-oriented programming, and data structures &amp; algorithms using Java. I really enjoyed working with Java and I\u2019m thinking about continuing with it (maybe learning Spring and other frameworks) and building my career in that direction.</p> <p>However, I still have 3 years until I graduate, and since my major is Cybersecurity, I\u2019ve also considered focusing on that instead. The thing is, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m truly passionate about cybersecurity yet \u2014 I feel a bit uncertain about it.</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate any advice from those who have been in a similar situation or have experience in either field.
