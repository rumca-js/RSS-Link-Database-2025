        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I saw some discussion on a post asking about the viability of SSDs for long-term cold storage, many people were recommending not just HDDs, but other things like &quot;discs&quot; and whatnot. I can&#39;t tell is this like a sarcastic joke or are there methods of storage that are legitimately better and safer than HDDs? I have so many externl hard drives for backups, and one or two is finally going bad but it&#39;s been like 6-7 years or so maybe even a bit more. Would it seriously be possible then to save things like photos and videos more securely on some kind of disc or other long-term storage method that could last decades without power? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SettingIntentions\"> /u/SettingIntentions </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1lmuqbh/alternative_storage_options_to_hdd/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Da",

Yes, there aren&#39;t a whole lot of features currently but it&#39;s been rapidly growing with the beginnings of a social hub, Android/iOS apps, built-in reader, plugin for Calibre, and more!! </p> <p>If you&#39;re looking for a new way to read books... this may be it!! Keep in mind, it is a library styled platform based off who you follow with a max of 10 borrows per user (family members excluded!). </p> <p>It also syncs your highlights with Notion and Obsidian and, currently, has a tier plan with a max of $10/month for 100GB of space!! They are working on a bring-your-own storage plan as well but you MUST be an Power user and you will be locked in to the $10/month with no price hikes!! </p> <p>What are you waiting for?! Go join and see what&#39;s good!!</p> <p>(If you&#39;re looking for followers, send me a DM and I&#39;ll drop u my link!)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
