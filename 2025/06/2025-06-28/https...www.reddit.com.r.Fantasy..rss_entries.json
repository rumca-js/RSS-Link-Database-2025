I&#39;m curious about trilogies where Book 2 is the obvious choice for the best one.</p> <p>The first one I can think of is probably Royal Assassin in the Farseer trilogy, which is often considered the best book in the trilogy (and the wider Elderlings series too). Another one that comes to mind is Shadows Linger, the second book in the original Black Company trilogy. But both of those books are technically part of a much bigger series even if they weren&#39;t intended to be so at first.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tylerxtyler\"> /u/tylerxtyler </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lmtdt7/fantasy_trilogies_where_the_second_book_is_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"htt",

I love the cozy vibe of it, and the distinct found family feeling, but I also like how it\u2019s not fully in the \u2018cozy fantasy space\u2019, because the plot is super serious, and you can make many dark things happen. Any good book recommendations that capture a similar feeling to how BG3 makes you feel?

I generally have enjoyed fantasy since I was a kid and some of my favourite recent finds have been through the sub so I thought I would give this a shot. </p> <p>I basically love fantasy for exploring politics and characters in a setting removed from our own, so generally I enjoy high/epic fantasy and not much of urban fantasy. Apart from that, I&#39;m not too fussed about the world building or rules of magic. I think for me it generally depends on whether I like the character and want to root for them and follow their story, and I&#39;m usually interested in the emotional side of things and the relationships between characters, though a good plot/interesting politics are also great. </p> <p>Recently I loved the Raven Scholar and the Daevabad Trilogy.
