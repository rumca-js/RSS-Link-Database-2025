        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, all; I&#39;m a HUGE horror movie buff. I love possession/exorcism, haunted house stuff, Paranormal Activity (found footage) films, supernatural; I&#39;m not really into suspense/drama/slashers - and I also love to read. I generally tend to read non-fiction (science, physics, cosmology, biography, history), but occasionally dabble in fiction (Warhammer, Dune, LotR, etc.).</p> <p>Anyway, given my obsession with horror, I&#39;m curious if there are any truly scary books. I&#39;m not interested in Stephen King or that general type of made-for-the-masses horror. I respect King, but I don&#39;t find his writing or movies really unsettling or truly scary.</p> <p>I guess, in a way, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for a book to be scary, so I&#39;m a little skeptical that such a book even exists, but I would very interested if there were truly a book that could give me the same feeling (or deeper) that a good horror movie gives me.</p> <p>Post your sug",

Which is also the first one that he had published.</p> <p>Many years ago both mankind and the slans fought in the deadly Slan Wars. This resulted in the near extermination of nearly all slans and a creation of a police state.</p> <p>But one Slan had escaped from extermination, and his name is Jommy Cross. He lives in constant fear in the cruel world of humans, and he is determined to avoid detection by any means, and seek out other slans. And with their help he will solve the mystery of the strange existence of the slans and their superiority.</p> <p>This is really one of Van Vogt,s fuller novels and not a fix up like the previous ones I&#39;ve read. But it is just as good! There is still that proverbial weirdness that I&#39;ve come to really like in his works.</p> <p>This one is full of action and adventure like the last ones that I&#39;ve read",
