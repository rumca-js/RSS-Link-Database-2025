It\u2019s meant to give more mental support, not just tracking, but actually helping reduce the stress and overload of trying to remember where everything is I haven\u2019t tested it with any other person with ADHD yet, but I\u2019ve been using it myself for 3 days to see what works. And honestly, it\u2019s helped. I\u2019ve remembered where I put things, which is rare for me.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve been procrastinating on it. At first, I thought it was just my ADHD, but I realized it\u2019s fear. The fear that I\u2019ll finish this thing and nothing happens. No users, no support, no feedback. Just silence. That\u2019s what\u2019s been slowing me down.</p> <p>I\u2019ve done a lot of research. I\u2019ve read Redd",

Worrying about milk expiration shouldn\u2019t be one of them.</p> <p>I built the MVP in one month from scratch. It\u2019s fully functional, with features like: \u2022 Stock tracking with email notifications \u2022 Live geolocation \u2022 A simple virtual assistant \u2022 A clean, easy-to-use interface</p> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f For now, the app is only available in French, as it was my final school project and I\u2019m based in France. But the English version is on the way, probably within the next week!</p> <p>The stack is Ruby on Rails with a bit of JavaScript \u2014 it\u2019s what I learned at bootcamp. Honestly, I was skeptical at first (you don\u2019t see a lot of Ruby in job listings), but I\u2019m glad I stuck with it. It\u2019s flexible",

I didn&#39;t want this amount to come by freelancing or selling services because I already have some experience with that and I occasionally do it. But I didn&#39;t have any true experience selling online. I liked the idea of making $10 by selling a product online because like many people say it&#39;s a form of making &quot;passive income&quot;. You build your product and once you get enough traction, visibility and sales, you don&#39;t need to invest much of your time anymore to see financial return.</p",
