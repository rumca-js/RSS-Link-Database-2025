Hello Games has achieved a balance between storytelling and gameplay that other developers have tried to emulate while allowing it to go from strength to strength. \n\nIt\u2019s a momentum that the studio will hope to sustain as it undertakes a new journey with Light No Fire.",

Meanwhile, the environments are nearly indistinguishable from real life, whether you're scaling the nearest mountain or walking through the desert. Then there are the particle effects, which you must see to appreciate.\n\nAnd that's before getting into all the little touches that Kojima Productions has added, from the signature (and bizarre) birthday wish from the cast to the sweet dreams that Sam can have.

Batman: Arkham Asylum proved that an incredible game was possible with a licensed hero, and Arkham City took that to the next level.\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight, which celebrates its 10th anniversary, is an interesting case.
