Super lightweight, does the job well, no complaints.</p> <p>But yesterday I had a bit of free time and decided to mess around with k0s\u2014and wow, I didn\u2019t expect to be this impressed. The whole declarative cluster setup using <code>k0sctl</code> is just <em>EASY</em>. You basically define your nodes and whatever Helm charts/extensions you want in a YAML file, run <code>k0sctl apply</code>, and boom\u2014your cluster is up and running.</p> <p>Honestly, the simplicity of it blew me away. Definitely considering switching things over. Has anyone game k0s a try in there home lab? Would love to hear your feedback.</p> <p>If anyone interested, you can find the template for my setup here: <a href=\"https://github.com/TheTaqiTahmid/homeserver/blob/master/ansible/roles/create-kubernetes-cluster/templates/k0sctl.yaml.j2\">https://github.com/TheTaq",

I am great at computers when it comes to things like troubleshooting, however I know absolutely nothing about programming or networking. I&#39;ve never used linux, and can&#39;t make sense of terms like proxies, dns, and ssh because they are defined with further jargon. Last year I was able to set up a raspberry pi-hole on my home router by following a set of precise step-by-step instructions, but I understood very little of it and still have no idea what all the command prompt stuff was/did - I&#39;m just glad I got through it without bricking my pc. </p> <p>I&#39;ve looked for &quot;complete beginner&#39;s guides&quot; but everything I&#39;m turning up still has too much discussion of this option vs that and assumptions that you know what it all means, and it seems like half the comments on threads requesting guides are just about how various guides have been mad",

I&#39;ve seen people say to port forward, but I&#39;ve also seen people be more hesitant to recommend port forwarding. I know about cloudflare tunneling, but I&#39;ve heard it causes problems with big files. So I&#39;m just kind of wondering where to go from here.
