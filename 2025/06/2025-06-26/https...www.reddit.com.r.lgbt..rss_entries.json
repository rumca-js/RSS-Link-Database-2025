We broke up when our daughter was 9 months old - we had been discussing breaking up for two years, blah blah it was finally time since we didn&#39;t want to raise her in a home without a loving relationship from her parents. </p> <p>Now she is 6, and this week she has said to me &quot;dad says that rainbow flag represents sin.&quot; Oh boy. This does not surprise me coming from him, but that hurt. I calmly asked her if she believes God loves everyone, she said yes. So I explained the flag represents pride for people who are in love with anyone, not just man and woman - then I suggested we love everyone and be kind, and that is her dad&#39;s opinion and she can feel however she wants to feel about it. I said she can take time to form her own opinions",

My roommate and I are part of the LGBTQIA+ community with him being gay and myself being pansexual/gender non-conforming.</p> <p>He is very convinced that the president will be sending members of the community to these deportation camps via getting rid of all their legal documentation like the folks with foreign last names that are having their info wiped everywhere.</p> <p>Is that going to happen? What do we even do? This thought is stressing me out because there is no safe way for us to get out.</p> <p>I dont know if he&#39;s fallen victim to extreme fear mongering or if this is something we actually need to worry about.
