Even an app like explorer and another one called APKPure(????). I am very concerned considering that my grandma has this one, should i be worried about something?

So basically it protects from onlookers understanding what I have already typed out. Sure they can sort of \u201cfollow my thumb\u201d along and figure out what I am typing that way, but if I just have my note open, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see what I have already typed. I\u2019m not concerned with \u201cend to end encryption\u201d, password protected notes, etc. I just don\u2019t want people to see what I am typing as I am typing it on my iPhone screen.
