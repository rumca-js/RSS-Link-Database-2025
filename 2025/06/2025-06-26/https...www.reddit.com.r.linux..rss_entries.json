For video sharing in Wayland we have to use portals. If what I&#39;m reading is correct, these portals simply establish communication to the video via pipewire right?</p> <p>But how does it work on the X11 side of things? I&#39;d imagine that jumping through a portal and pipewire not only introduces some overhead, but also adds 2 other points of failure. For example on both KDE wayland and Hyprland I&#39;ve had to restart the portal in the past to get video streaming working again.</p> <p>Does X11 just have direct access to the frame buffer and that&#39;s how it works? Is it also going through pipewire (unlikely since in X&#39;s glory days pipewire wasn&#39;t a thing). I&#39;m just curious.

All mail clients (Outlook, RoundCube, maybe local mail addressed to 3rd party addressee) should go through the machine/domain A and then route to subdomain (machine B).
