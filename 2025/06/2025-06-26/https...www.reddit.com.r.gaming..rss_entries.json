I&#39;d like to hopefully get it to the eyes of some people who haven&#39;t already seen it and can make a tangible difference. I personally care very deeply for games preservation.</p> <p>For those unaware, the stop killing games initiative is a petition to get EU lawmakers to address the systematic destruction of video games. If it reaches 1m signatures, the EU is obligated to at least give a definitive answer and potentially write a bill that addresses it one way or another. If you are an EU citizen, and you care about the preservation of video games please sign the petition here, there can&#39;t be any change if no one tries. Anyways, thank you for reading.

This was a level that didn&#39;t try to funnel you down a cooridor, but instead gave you an entire world to roam around in with you having to get to get to the middle of the structure in the middle to complete the level. </p> <p>I&#39;ve told this story before but when I first got to it, ilI just started walking in more or less straight line, only to be killed cause I was sniped by a Grunt. I had played Mario 64 and I was a Nintendo 64 kid so 3D worlds were nothing new to me, but Halo made me rethink everything I knew about 3D. </p> <p>And Ocaraina: I actually had a bad first impression of the game, I mean not bad but after months of hype, I got it and played the first dungeon and was like &quot;Really, Nintendo , Really&quot; But the next day I beat the first boss and got out to Hyrule Fields and it was absolutely mind blowin",
