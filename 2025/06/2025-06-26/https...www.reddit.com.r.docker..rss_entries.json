Before the break I was working on java software development but they were legacy softwares and I wasn&#39;t using latest technologies. I have been studying and familiarising myself with various tools and technologies. I need your help to check and see if I need to learn any other tools and technologies to become a successful Java backend developer. I have learnt Java basics and latest features like streams, functional interfaces etc,springboot, spring MVC, spring data JPA, hibernate and familiarised myself with docker, basics of microservices, rest api, spring security, jwt , oauth2, postgresql,AWS, and surface level knowledge of kubernetes. Am I missing anything important? I am going to start attending interviews soon and I really need your help here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bibliophile1290\"> /u/bibli",
