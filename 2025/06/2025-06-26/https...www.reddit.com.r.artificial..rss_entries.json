Now it\u2019s outperforming humans Most companies used to treat voice bots as a way to cut costs. They were slower, clunkier, and less reliable than human agents. That\u2019s changed in the last year or so.</li> </ol> <p>This founder said AI agents now perform just as well, sometimes better, than humans in many contact center use cases. And they cost about a tenth as much.</p> <p>What&#39;s even more surprising is that phone calls still outperform other channels. Around 30% of people answer the phone. Only 2% click on emails. Customers who call also tend to have a higher lifetime value.</p> <p>Would love to hear if",
