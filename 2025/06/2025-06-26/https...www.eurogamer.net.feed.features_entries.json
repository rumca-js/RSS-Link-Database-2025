As technology improves, these rereleases allow players to revisit a game with fresh eyes and enjoy their old favourites on modern platforms. For developers and publishers, rereleases are an efficient way to land in the hands of more players. And that's particularly important in the current climate of the games industry, where budgets are tight and developing new projects takes years of effort - <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-physical-game-sales-dropped-by-35-in-2024-in-shift-towards-digital\">and there is not always a guaranteed return on investment</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/gaming-ai-remasters-can-they-be-any-good\">Read more</a></p>",
