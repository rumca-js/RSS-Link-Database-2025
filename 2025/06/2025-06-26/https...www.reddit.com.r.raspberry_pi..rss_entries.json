Does it matter whether this is done through config.txt or at the software level after the server boots? I was under the assumption turning off or not using the interfaces (e.g. <code>systemctl disable bluetooth.service</code>) is not good enough.</p> <p>When I did some looking, it seems there&#39;s a lot of conflicting and outdated info for e.g. how to disable HDMI since it will be headless, especially because I&#39;m using a RHEL-based ARM server. So far the only optimizations I&#39;m certain are adding the following to config.txt:</p> <pre><code># disable wifi dtoverlay=disable-wifi # disable bluetooth dtoverlay=disable-bt </code></pre> <p>Any tips are much appreciated for general optimizations since I&#39;m using a standard Linux ARM server.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",
