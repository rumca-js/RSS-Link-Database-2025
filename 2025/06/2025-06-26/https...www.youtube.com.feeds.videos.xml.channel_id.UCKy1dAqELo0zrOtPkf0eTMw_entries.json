This week, we\u2019re joined by Simon Cardy, who reviewed DS2 for IGN, to discuss the many things it does right, whether or not that\u2019s enough to win over folks who didn\u2019t live the first game, and also unpack a handful of criticisms of Hideo Kojima\u2019s latest magnum opus. One thing\u2019s for sure, it\u2019s a step up in practically every way from the first game, with better visuals, better paced missions, and a whole arsenal of new gadgets, gear, and guns to help Sam Porter Bridges deliver the mail, fend off BTs, or terrorize roaming bands of ruffians throughout the Australian outback.\u00a0\n\nWatch the Full Epsiode here! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TVvagDqirw\n\nThis week\u2019s show is Max Scoville, Jada Griffin, Nick Limon, Simon Cardy, and is produced by Nick Maillet",

        "description": "M3GAN 2.0, reviewed by Tom Jorgensen.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is admirable in its attempts to broaden the franchise\u2019s horizons, and it finds some success in forcing the characters to work together against common enemy AMELIA. Jenna Davis and Amie Donald\u2019s joint performance as M3GAN unsurprisingly steals the show once again, but Allison Williams and Violet McGraw hold down the human side of the story well. The big shift away from horror and towards sci-fi/action represents a lateral move for the sequel, though, essentially just applying a different set of tropes to the M3GAN character. It\u2019s an adjustment that works better than you may expect, though maybe not as well as you\u2019d hope. At least M3GAN herself is as hilarious and off-putting as ever.",
