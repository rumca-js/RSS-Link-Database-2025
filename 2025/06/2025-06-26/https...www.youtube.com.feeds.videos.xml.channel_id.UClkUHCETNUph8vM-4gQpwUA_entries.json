        "description": "Everdark Sovereign DARKDRIFT KNIGHT UPDATE & GAMEPLAY, TIPS & New GEAR\nSo the new Everdark Sovereign boss just dropped. And this is the Darkdrift Knight. They made an announcement about this. I'm going to show you guys our attempt at it. This was our very first attempt. We managed to get it down. I played pretty badly in this run. I got killed quite a few times. There was a bit of lag that was causing my dodging to be a little bit weird, but you're going to see that Fex just absolutely carries in this boss fight.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Everdark Sovereign Event\n0:54 Darkdrift Knight Fulgor Event\n6:30 Ending the Fight & Final Thoughts\n7:32 Reward and the Shop\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/\n",
