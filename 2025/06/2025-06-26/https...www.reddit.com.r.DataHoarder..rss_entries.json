The family used it as a backup location for pretty much anything. It finally failed last year, I haven&#39;t tried to recover anything from it yet but the kids are gone off to college and I think I&#39;ve got all the data that was on it on other drives so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth trying to recover anything from it, which is fortunate cause it looks like it would be a pain since one of the drives is dead and the enclosure is dead. </p> <p>In the spring I bought 2 Seagate EXOS recerted 20TB drives and dropped them in my main desktop, its a Dell XPS 8930, it&#39;s a little older but it had 64 GB of memory and runs an i9. </p> <p>My plan was to RAID 1 them, since that would be the simplest, robust, and easy to recover if one dies.
