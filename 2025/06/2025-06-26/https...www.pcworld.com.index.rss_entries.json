No need to juggle and manage API keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Build a Claude-power",

I\u2019m already juggling a pair of 27-inch monitors, a couple of boxy Bluetooth speakers, a full-size mechanical keyboard\u2013not to mention I also need space for the occasional connected laptop.
