        "description": "Project Veritas\u2019 \"Without Consent Part 2\" investigation unveils Elvira Syed\u2019s heart-wrenching testimony, accusing Reverend Aaron Miller, a transgender pastor in Hartford, Connecticut, of manipulating DCF to fracture her family, ultimately contributing to the tragic death of her daughter, Ilene Syed.\n\n\u201cI heard about Pastor Aaron Miller from a DCF (Department of Children and Family) social worker. Aaron Miller filed a complaint against me after he saw my daughter only once for emotional abuse because I was refusing to affirm her gender identity due to my Muslim beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was not [for] Pastor Miller, if he did not put the wedge between me and my daughter, my daughter would be still alive.\u201d\n\nExpose Corruption.
