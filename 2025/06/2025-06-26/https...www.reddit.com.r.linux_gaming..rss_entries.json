The problem is the launcher I use for GOG games on my pc is Lutris which I can\u2019t figure out how to get to launch games with Proton, it only gives me Wine as an option, and this is a concern because all the info I can find online about Cyberpunk on Wine is A) really old (like only a few months after launch) and B) really negative. Does Cyberpunk run well on Wine in 2025 or should I opt for the Steam release and use Proton instead? P.S. if there\u2019s a tutorial you could point me towards for using Proton instead of Wine on Lutris that would also solve this dilemma, thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kindly_Bar7785\"> /u/Kindly_B",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a dual-booted Legion Go with Windows and Bazzite. So I partitioned my 1TB SSD into three parts - two 150GB partitions (one for Windows OS and one for Bazzite) and the remaining 630ish GB for games that can be shared between both OS. So, I ran the extremely long fstab command and successfully mounted the NTFS partition in Linux. I then added it as a drive in Steam and installed a game to test if the NTFS partition works across both operating systems, and it did. Then I downloaded the NonSteamLaunchers plugin and downloaded the Rockstar Games Launcher, but when I try to install GTA, this ugly directory pops up with no NTFS partition in sight. How do I fix it so that the NTFS partition can be recognized by not just Rockstar but also other NonSteamLaunchers (because the same ugly directory pops up for Epic Games). I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong because the partition seems to be mounted correctly, as it shows up in Steam.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",
