While these methods allow you to route each request to the correct destination, you should also have a way to validate route parameters ahead of executing the action method. To do this, you can take advantage of route constraints to define patterns based on the API behavior you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/2260585/how-to-create-route-constraints-in-aspnet-core.html\">earlier post</a> here, we discussed how to work with route constraints when building",
