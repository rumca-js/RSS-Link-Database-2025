Is The Chronicles of Narnia (The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe specifically) unique in that it has the main kingdom ruled by the protagonists, who are all siblings? Like, it feels like that&#39;s the only fantasy story I can find where ruling monarchs of the same fantasy kingdom, all rule equally in terms of power, and yet it&#39;s the only one where the monarchs aren&#39;t wed to each other or others? </p> <p>It&#39;s kind of odd that this isn&#39;t more common in fantasy to me is what I&#39;m saying. </p> <p>Even in fairytales, it seems to not be a thing, as I&#39;ve seen (mostly French for some reason?) the protagonist marry their royal cousin and rule with them, but no other fantasy story where they rule alongside their relative and <em>don&#39;t</em> marry them.</p> <p>IDK, I think it&#39;s a missed opportunity in fantasy to have familial rulers more often.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

Good work on Barker\u2019s part wrapping everything up. It\u2019s always hard writing a review of the last book in a series without spoilers, so apologies for this being irritatingly vague.</p> <p>The scope of this trilogy came a long, long way from Cahan scraping out an existence on his farm - it\u2019s honestly hard for me to recall how small-scale the books began. As much as things scaled up in book 2, they scaled up again at least as much in book 3.</p> <p>Once again we have a shift in dominant POVs. This time around, the chief perspectives are those of Udinny, Venn, Dassit, and Sorha. We also get occasional glimpses of Saradis and, yes, Cahan, but those first four are definitely our chief protagonists.</p> <p>Barker laid his groundwork carefully. Everything here built on what was learned about Crua in the first two books, but I will admit I did not expect",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So this is a question i have stuck in my head everytime i encounter necromancy in a fantasy world. Because the main types you will find of undead (apart from for example vampires) would be Zombies, Skeletons or ghosts. </p> <p>In most mainstream media a way to defeat a zombie would be to destroy its head wich usualy makes sense due to the zombies being a result of infections/fungi. But with mana? Dark arts? What realy can you do against one? My best example would be the way undead are represented in Oblivion. Some are fully human but others are missing arms, legs some have massive wounds on the side and others are missing their head.</p> <p>But then what can you realy do? Incinerate them? That would just turn your zombie into either a skeleton or i guess a ghost! (or maybe just a burning zombie because i dont think it will care about being set alight until its literaly falling apart). You could try to crush one but then again whats stopping it to turn",

Anything with elves, deep nature magic and connection to nature, nature spirits, fae, dryads, ents, animal companions, magical living forests. Nothing having to do with real world settings - I&#39;m looking for that high fantasy, enchanted feeling of exploration and wonder. Bonus points if I cry. Bonus points for ethereal, lyrical prose, I don&#39;t mind Tolkien-esque descriptions.</p> <p>I&#39;ve perused some other threads and can&#39;t quite find one that trips my trigger!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mossfae\"> /u/mossfae </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ll32tn/looking_for_extremely_magical_high_fantasy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ll32tn/looking_for_extremely_magical_high_fantasy/\">[comments]</a></span>",
