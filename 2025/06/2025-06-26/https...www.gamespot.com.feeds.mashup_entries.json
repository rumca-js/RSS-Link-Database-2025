However, many players have taken to Reddit and other internet sounding boards to voice their displeasure with the match, as it seems to have made some unwelcome changes to online play.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple users have revealed that Patch 1.1.2 makes it more difficult to have the standard three-lap race when playing online with friends. Matchmaking, it seems, prefers what have been dubbed \"intermission races\"--or races where drivers must instead ride through the open map from one track to another, and then run a single lap on the new track.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4522040-mario-kart-world-patch.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4522040\" data-ratio=",
