Much good it did the Citizens, who lost the return leg in Turin 2-0, Gaetano Scirea and Roberto Boninsegna with the goals at the Stadio Comunale. Names that evoke some proper old-school Italian glamour, right there. Since then, it\u2019s been slim pickings for City, with two draws and four defeats against the <em>Bianconeri</em>. The latest of those losses came just seven months ago, during City\u2019s downright strange mid-season misfire. An opportunity for City to right some historical wrongs tonight.</p><p",

I\u2019d just played the Jobs for a Change festival, in the middle of London, easy to get to by tube. But Glastonbury was like being on an island. You had to deal with the weather, the food and the toilets. It was also mainly populated by Bristolians. I performed once solo, but also got up on the Pyramid stage with [country and western singer] Hank Wangford to do (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66. The original Pyramid was made from corrugated iron and doubled as a cowshed. I remember it being swampy backstage. There were no bars, you had to bring in your own beer. Keith Allen and [Scottish poet] Jock Scott blagged their way in, pretending to be a Belgian film crew, and sold cans of Red Stripe for 50p.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/26/glas",
