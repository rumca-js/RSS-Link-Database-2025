It felt like nothing was going right and my depression was crippling. I decided to go to Facebook and expressed feeling hopeless and heavily implied wanting to take my life. I am sad I did that, and fortunately I am in a much healthier place now.</p> <p>During this time period, for fun I added a bunch of actors as friends who I knew from movies I was a fan of. Being familiar with David Dastmalchian from &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; &quot;Ant-Man,&quot; and &quot;Prisoners,&quot; I added him and was thrilled to see he actually accepted my request. Anyway, a few hours after my post, David sent an encouraging message letting me know I wasn&#39;t alone, that I was supported, and things would get better.</p> <p>For an actor like him to decide to reach out to a stranger like me, that meant a lot. Whenever I have seen David appear in a movie since, like &quot;The Suicide Squad,&quo",
