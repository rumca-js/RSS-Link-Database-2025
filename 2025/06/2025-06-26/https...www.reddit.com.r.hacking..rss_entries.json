I have no intention to physically harm the person, I just want to find their identity and find their relatives to send the screenshots to them and have them realize what a creep they have in their family. I don&#39;t need messages telling me to &quot;just let it go&quot;, I personally want him to face consequences for his actions.</p> <p>The person left the messenger convo right after sending the creepy messages, but I have what&#39;s supposedly their name, and the city they&#39;re from. It&#39;s kind of a common enough name that there would be at least 5 guys named like this in the city, but not too common where I would think it&#39;s a fake name. <",
