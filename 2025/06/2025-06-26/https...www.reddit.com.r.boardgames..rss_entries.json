I was just wondering if anyone who&#39;s hosted a murder mystery party using their games could help (I heard they have a customer support line, i&#39;m not sure how to contact it though, so if you have the number/email for that it&#39;d be great as well). I&#39;ve just printed out the packets, I read a bit from the top, and noticed it said that you should read all the character packets? How neccescary would that be to the success of the party, since it seems like quite a lot to read to me. Also, i&#39;ve never attended a murder mystery party before this one, how do these usually play out? How do you decide which characters to assign to the more/less into rp/murder mystery people, do the instructions specify which roles are more major, or are all of the original roles usually pr",

While Bodoge does allow ratings on a 1-10 scale similar to BGG, the UI of the site moreso encourages users to categorize games as &#39;Interested&#39;, &#39;Experienced&#39;, &#39;Favorite&#39;, and &#39;Own&#39;. It&#39;s very common for games to have more &#39;Favorites&#39; than total ratings, so there would be a real sampling issue if I used the raw ratings.</p> <p>For this reason, I instead decided to go with the metric of looking at the ratio of &#39;Favorite&#39; to &#39;Experienced&#39; ratings, and found that it seemed to be the best proxy for how well-liked a game is.
