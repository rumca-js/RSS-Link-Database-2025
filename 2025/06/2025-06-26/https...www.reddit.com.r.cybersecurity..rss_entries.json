While it\u2019s already a solid scanner, I\u2019d love to hear from real users or sysadmins:</p> <p>What limitations have you noticed while using Lynis in production or during audits?</p> <p>Are there important security checks or integrations it currently lacks?</p> <p>Have you ever needed to supplement Lynis with other tools (e.g., for cloud audits, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, etc.)?</p> <p>What features or modules would you find useful if added? </p> <p>My goal is to propose and develop a few new features that could address these gaps. Your feedback would be incredibly helpful in identifying practical improvements.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tiny_Answer2156\"> /u/Tiny_Answer2156 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/co",

I am a new cybersecurity professional who completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program and passed the CompTIA Security+ CE exam.

Recently, however, I was offered and accepted a part-time position as a bookkeeper for a small company that is still in their early stages. The company does not have many employees, and they lack an IT or security team. I am therefore considering to offer to take on a cybersecurity role and perform related tasks on the days I\u2019m",
