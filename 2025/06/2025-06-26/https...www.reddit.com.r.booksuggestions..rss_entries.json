Loved Six of Crows, a lot of Brandon Sanderson, Lies of Locke Lemora, but looking to expand my library. As a kid I loved Ranger&#39;s Apprentice, Percy Jackson, the usual YA fantasy adventure novels. Basic stuff.

I really like supernatural horror books, especially ones that have the ability to scare me. The only book that has ever scared me that much has been The Exorcist because of Blatty&#39;s writing style, but I felt like his other books focused too much on the investigation and less on the horror aspect. I like most fiction and sci-fi books too - I loved A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor by Hank Green, which I know is a sequel but it was still great. I&#39;m looking for another author / series that will suck me in, and I&#39;m willing to try new stuff too. I have access to a wonderful local library and never know what to choose. What got you out of your reading lul?

I was watching Cowboy Bebop and enjoyed the fact that it&#39;s a noir/western/romance just set in a relatively poor solar system. I dislike a lot of quirky concepts, like reading book descriptions where they talk about &quot;The One Important Thing&quot;. I would like to read about relatively &quot;normal&quot; characters, basically humans of 2025. I think the game Starfield is like this kind of.

I read a lot of horror so that would be fine, but also some sort of thriller, &#39;weird&#39; psychological type book, - something with the vibe of the film the lighthouse, or some kind of dark secret in a small coastal town would be perfect. Basically anything where the tone is very dark, and the sea is a central motif. </p> <p>I might start with Moby Dick just to kickstart things, although I don&#39;t know how dark that is as I&#39;ve never read it before lol </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/watchingblooddry\"> /u/watchingblooddry </a> <br/> <span><",

I love his writing and find it to be very beautiful and tender, like each sentence is meticulously crafted, and that in itself is what tells the story and moves along the plot. I&#39;m looking for more books like this. Like they are written with a flowing and rhythmic prose. Oh, also Ta-Nehisi Coates -- his writing is so evocative and poetic. </p> <p>I feel like the novels I&#39;ve picked up lately are great with storytelling, but lack the rich poetry I&#39;m looking for. I recently read Last Night in Twisted River by John Irving, for example, and while I have always admired his detailed storytelling, I find myself wanting more complexity and abstract imagery in the writing style itself. Does this make sense? Anyone have recommendations (except for John Banville&#39;s The Sea, which was stylistic but I thought was so arrogantly written).

Now I just finished my first year and finally have a break over summer and I wanna try some books! I think I\u2019m looking for some fiction or really cool/compelling nonfiction. I\u2019m a huge baseball fan and I\u2019m an avid skier/surfer so I love a good adventure. I\u2019m also intrigued by history and politics. Overall, I just want to find something to enjoy, but also maybe sound smart when I tell my friends that I read it. Any suggestions would be appreciated thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tka45\"> /u/tka45 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lktvfp/law_student_with_free_time_wanting_to_get_into/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lktvfp/law_student_with_free_time_wanting_to_get_into/\"",

I am not a big reader, but was bored at school during lectures , and picked up Jack London&#39;s work. While I enjoyed White Fang, the Call of the Wild, and (my favorite of the bunch) Smoke Bellew, Martin Eden was completely different. I loved the physiological and philosophical depths discussed by the narrator. Seeing into Eden&#39;s mind as the story progressed was wonderful. I also read the Sea Wolf, which was very good but did not reach the peaks of Martin Eden. Any suggestions on similar books to read? Could be by Jack London or any other author?</p> <p>(P.S. why is it that I rarely hear Jack London discussed. He is an amazing author, and from what I hear from relatives, extremely popular in Europe and the former U.S.S.R?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/peersoon12345\"> /u/peersoon12345 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/",

I read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi with romance but he said he\u2019d probably like something more grounded in reality. He\u2019s never been a reader so I don\u2019t have much go off of. He said something that maybe has some humor/comedy but I\u2019m really open to anything.</p> <p>What are some books that got you into reading or you might recommend someone that\u2019s interested in getting started? Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xNeverEnoughx\"> /u/xNeverEnoughx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lkm0u5/suggest_me_a_book_that_got_you_into_reading/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lkm0u5/suggest_me_a_book_that_got_you_into_reading/\">[comments]</a></span>",
