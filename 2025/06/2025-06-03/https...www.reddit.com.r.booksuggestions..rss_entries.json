As an avid reader, I can only take so much television even if it is one of my favorite shows. So I\u2019m looking for some thing that feels like gravity falls, but older. Think summer adventure, crazy mysteries and creatures. I love the vibes of old forest, secrets, and the summer heat. Generally speaking, I read romance, and would prefer some sprinkled in but any rec is appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Euphoric_Act_350\"> /u/Euphoric_Act_350 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l2mnvk/gravity_fallsbut_more/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l2mnvk/gravity_fallsbut_more/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have two purposes for this post: 1) what were your thoughts? Did this book stir something inside of you (in the best of ways) as it did for me? Something about this novel created a hunger within me that was only satisfied when I began to read it for the second time.

I really love reading The Enchanted Wood by Enid Blyton and would love to have recommendations on what to read next that&#39;s just like it. I want them to be also magical with full of magics and magical happenings.</p> <p>I prefer if they&#39;re a standalone, or if they&#39;re a series, I hope I can read them even if its not in order. You can recommend me books or authors and I would really appreciate them.</p> <p>Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/myother_me\"> /u/myother_me </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l2893n/looking_for_a_standalone_book_just_like_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l2893n/looking_for_a_standalone_book_just_like_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",

She\u2019s a very down-to-earth person, and I want to find a book she\u2019d love.</p> <p>Any suggestions for books that would be a good gift for her?

What really hooked me with Red Rising was:</p> <p>The emotional attachment I felt to the characters \u2014 I cared deeply about Darrow, Mustang, Sevro, Victra etc. The gritty, often brutal tone. Characters die. Tough choices are made. People betray each other. It\u2019s dark but still full of heart. The complex themes \u2014 rebellion, class struggle, identity, sacrifice. A narrative that isn\u2019t afraid to go hard, with both action and moral ambiguity. I don\u2019t need it to be sci-fi, though that\u2019s a plus. I just want something that will give me that same punch in the gut emotionally and keep me turning pages.
