Since I am a complete newbie, I am seeking second opinions and advice regarding my build. I plan on building a PC and installing TrueNAS onto it. Some apps that I plan to use include Jellyfin/Jellyseer, Nextcloud, Immich, and Pi-hole. Mostly want to use this server to download/watch media on my home TVs, store files, and block ads. </p> <p>Originally thought about getting a used Optiplex or something similar but I would like to have lots of room for future expansion inside the case.

I tried running Fedora in proxmox VM for remote access so I could access from the tab. For some reason the remote experiencia is really bad, I tried Gnome too, with different remote access apps, RDP, rust desk and nomachine.</p> <p>Nomachine is by far the best one, though not perfect in Fedora, I think it might be a wayland thing.</p> <p>I then tried Linux Mint and was really impressed how well it worked with nomachine, it really is night a day difference, I could even use it on 4g.</p> <p>Has anyone had similar experience? Do you have a prefered distro to run as RD?</p> <p>Also, I passed my intel iGPU to these VMs and I could access from an external monitor, but could only do remote access to Linux Mint, again maybe a waylang thing?</p",
