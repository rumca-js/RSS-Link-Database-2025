        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey folks,</p> <p>The recent announcement that Google plans to replace most of search with AI summaries is the last straw for me and I plan to start using a different provider. The problem is that I am utterly overwhelmed by which to use.</p> <p>My two &quot;finalists&quot; were DuckDuckGo and Kagi. However, I&#39;ve since read that DuckDuckGo&#39;s quality of results has massively degraded, though I don&#39;t have enough experience to know this myself.</p> <p>Kagi was my other first choice, but when I go to their website I now see that they are now also strongly pushing AI Summaries and Chatbot Assistants. I cannot stress enough how much I hate all this LLM bullshit everyone is trying to force on me, so unless there is a way to completely avoid and turn that off, it&#39;s a dealbreaker for me.</p> <p>So, that being the case - what are folks using as a decent alternative to Google Search as of June 2025?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3",
