It\u2019s the flagship launch game for Nintendo Switch 2, the first open world in the series, the follow-up to the hugely successful Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and on top of all that, it\u2019s Nintendo\u2019s first $80 game since the N64 days, which has caused no shortage of internet discourse. There\u2019s a lot riding on this one, so I\u2019m pleased to report that after spending roughly five hours with unrestricted access to the final build, I\u2019m confident Mario Kart World\u2019s thrilling racing will kick off Nintendo\u2019s eighth generation with a rocket start, even if I\u2019m still not completely sold on its open-world exploration.",
