Around 400 people used it and I got lots (really!) of thank you messages and people saying it&#39;s helping them. </p> <p>I want to develop the tool further and just added a new feature: optional (!) AI-powered ranking. It tries to understand what you&#39;re actually looking for (not only by the keywords) and ranks results by relevance. Still experimental and a bit slow, but works. </p> <p>It&#39;s 100% free. I&#39;d really appreciate any feedback, especially on the AI part. </p> <p>Also just started a Discord to collect feedbacks, share ideas, and chat with other building stuff:<br/> <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/ZyDJJ3MM\">https://discord.com/invite/ZyDJJ3MM</a> </p> <p>Tool link: <a href=\"http://mention.click\">mention.click</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

In it, you add pets and set reminders \u2014 like vet visits, feeding times, or medicine.</p> <p>Everyone in the Nucleus sees the same pets and reminders. If one person adds or changes something, it updates for everyone. No need to message or remind others. It\u2019s all shared automatically.</p> <p>Good for families sharing pet duties, pet sitters handling many animals, or neighbours helping while you&#39;re away. Simple way to keep pet care organised, together. </p> <p>What do you think? Do you think its just like any other app?
