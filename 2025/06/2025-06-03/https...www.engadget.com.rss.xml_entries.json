You play as Ro, a hunter from a small tribe, who is grieving her son's death. Mystical voices beckon her toward a spirit realm as she tries to bring him back. Ro's adventure leads her on a journey of \"love, loss and the slow path toward acceptance.\"</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The game's deck-based combat will unlock various melee and ranged spell attacks.

However, like many gift-giving celebrations, obtaining the Switch 2 comes with several implications for your wallet and how it will fit into your life. So after getting the chance to play the Switch 2 for nearly 15 hours across two different sessions, I wanted to put together one last preview about Nintendo's next console and if you should (or should not) try to snag one when it officially goes on sale on June 5.</p> \n<p>Note: Another big reason for this second preview/hands-on is because unlike in years past, members of the media won't be getting review units prior to launch. So this story features as much info as we have right now before open sales begin later this week.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h2> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creat",
