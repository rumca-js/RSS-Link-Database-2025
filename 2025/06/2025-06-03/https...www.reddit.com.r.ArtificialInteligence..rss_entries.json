New research introduces <strong>VGBench</strong>, a fascinating benchmark that puts VLMs to the test in classic 1990s video games.</p> <p>The idea is to see if VLMs can manage perception, spatial navigation, and memory in dynamic, interactive environments, using only raw visual inputs and high-level objectives. It&#39;s a tough challenge designed to expose their real-world capabilities beyond static tasks.</p> <p><strong>What they found was pretty surprising:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Even top-tier VLMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro completed only a tiny fraction of the games (e.g., 0.48% of VGBench).</li> <li>A major bottleneck is <strong>inference latency</strong> \u2013 the models are too slow to react in real-time.</li> <",
