I&#39;m having trouble finding a UPS compatible with the official pi power requirements. The longer life the better, but I could make as little as half an hour work for power supply (up to 8ish hours would be nice though). The only viable solution I&#39;ve com across so far is PiSugar S UPS and that would require more modification to my setup than I prefer (already have it housed). I&#39;ve found UPS&#39;s with 5v/3a usb-c pd outputs, but I really don&#39;t want to run into power issues because this will be running 24/7 with SSD. Sorry if this is a hot topic and it has ben asked a lot.

Transformer outside my house blew and power went out for maybe 30 seconds, but none of my network gear came back up after. After digging through things, the Pi is sitting at an intramfs prompt. No luck with fsck, so I pull the card to check it in another device. SD card is covered in some sort of oil. No oil on the heatsink, mount, area around or under the pi, just the sd slot. My best bet is it came from the heatsink foam tape but it still doesn&#39;t seem right. There are no components large enough for this to have been an electrolytic from a capacitor. I am not so much worried about fixing it, just regaining my sanity for with some sort of logical explanation of where it could have come from. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Duties_as_invented\"> /u/Duties_as_invented </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",

The thing is, the app I&#39;m using on my phone to do this likes to close out of the terminal when the screen times out, and I recently had to bring my screen timeout down to 15 seconds for non-Pi reasons.
