His match\u2011winning 166 against the West Indies on Sunday was perhaps his greatest white-ball innings, but above all it was simply a <em>Joe Root</em> innings, all gentle nudges and classical drives, timing over power, manoeuvrability over muscularity, a triumph of pure talent.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/03/joe-",

In life, she was by turns an editor, critic, biographer, playwright, Jewish Gentile, Catholic convert, divorcee, abandoning mother, spy. As Frances Wilson observes in this canny biography, she looks in every photograph as if she is played by a different actor, so drastic are the changes in her face and style. From precocious Edinburgh schoolgirl to unhappy Rhodesian wife, spirited London bohemian to poised Roman socialite, Spark made an art of unsettling transformations. She was the queen of narrative control, not least the narrative of her own life.</p><p>She was also the enemy of biographers, a pursuer of lawsuits who managed to delay the publication of her own authorised biography by seven years (\u201ca hatchet job",
