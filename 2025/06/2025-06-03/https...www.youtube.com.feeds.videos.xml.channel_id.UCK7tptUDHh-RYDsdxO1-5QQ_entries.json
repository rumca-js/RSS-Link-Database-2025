While solar and wind power now make up a larger share of the electricity supply, the power grid wasn\u2019t designed to handle them.\n\nWSJ asked a power grid engineer to break down the mechanics of renewable energy to explain three ways to make the grid more resilient to disruptions. \n\nChapters:\n0:00 Renewable energy\u2019s hidden problem\n0:35 Why the power grid needs inertia\n2:01 Solution #1: grid-forming inverter\n3:55 Solution #2: synchronous condenser\n4:51 Solution #3: battery energy storage systems\n5:53 The power grid\u2019s future\n\nPro Perfected\nExperts in engineering and design break down a ubiquitous problem, examining how the world is built and what can make it better.\n\n#Solar #RenewableEnergy #WSJ",
