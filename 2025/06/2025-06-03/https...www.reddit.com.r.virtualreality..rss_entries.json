I guess I am just a PC VR guy...but there hasn&#39;t been a game to match the quality of games from 5-10 years ago! Lone Echo was amazing....Half-Life Alyx amazing...Robo Recall....Arizona Sunshine....Edge of Nowhere....Wilsons Heart amazing game.....Defector all classics! Now all we get is crap mobile quality games. I understand the budgets aren&#39;t there as they will not sell enough copies to cover the cost.....but will we ever get back to that quality?

More recently though, I&#39;ve finally been able to spend longer sitting upright and sometimes even playing video games which has been great, but I&#39;ve also been getting really curious about VR for mainly two things:<br/> 1. VRchat or other immersive ways to socialise with people without risking my health. Being able to interact with people in that three dimensional sorta way <em>without</em> being limited by the main physical barriers that come with not being able-bodied sounds amazing<br/> 2. &quot;Exploring&quot; (?? for lack of a better word lol). I love everything to do with learning about foreign landscapes, cultures and architecture and not being able to go outside and actually experience",

I\u2019m pretty new to VR and have spent a lot of time reading up on different headsets and setups, but honestly, it\u2019s kind of overwhelming with all the choices and technical stuff. So I thought I\u2019d come here and see if anyone can help me figure out the best option for my situation.</p> <p>One big thing for me is that I\u2019d prefer a wired connection to my PC for the best performance and stability, but I\u2019m not opposed to wireless if it doesn\u2019t require Wi-Fi because here\u2019s the deal. I live in a garage setup, and my PC is connected to the internet through Ethernet only. So I don\u2019t have WiFi, which limits some of the wireless options that depend on a good WiFi network.</p> <p>Battery life isn\u2019t a big deal since I\u2019m not sure how long my sessions will be. I want to buy within a few weeks and don\u2019t want to wait for new releases.</p> <p>I\u2019m fine with buying used gear if it helps me get the best setup within my budget around 500.
