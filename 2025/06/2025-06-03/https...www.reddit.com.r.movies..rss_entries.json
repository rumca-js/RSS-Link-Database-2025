When I saw The Void (2016) was streaming free on TUBI, I decided to give it a watch. </p> <p>I have to say, it was by far one of the best monster films I&#39;ve seen in quite awhile. I&#39;d venture to say the monsters were on par with or possibly even surpassing John Carpenter&#39;s The Thing.</p> <p>I looked into the production and was AMAZED this film was made on an $82,000 crowd funded budget. I can&#39;t even compare this film to a low budget film because it competes with multimillion dollar budget films and in my opinion, wins. </p> <p>What did you think about The Void? Did you enjoy it?
