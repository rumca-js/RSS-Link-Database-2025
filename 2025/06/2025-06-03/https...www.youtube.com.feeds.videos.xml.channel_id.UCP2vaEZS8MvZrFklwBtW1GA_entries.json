        "description": "Unfortunately, I had to move the shower drain. The first step was to cut out the old plywood using a circular saw and a multi-tool. I then applied Great Stuff Construction Adhesive on the I-Joists. The Smart Dispenser allows the adhesive to be used for up to 30 days. The adhesive and 2-inch screws prevent the new piece of plywood from creaking or deflecting, which is important for the new shower drain. Many thanks to @greatstufffoam  for sponsoring this video",
