The introduction to the feature in the Switch reveal trailer looked choppy and poor quality. While I and others gave them credit for showing the feature in a \"warts and all\" state, it was a confusing choice to center so much of the presentation around a video-sharing function that looked, well, bad. Having now spent some time with GameChat at an extensive hands-on preview, I can't say I'm confident that the final quality will be any better than we saw--but I am sure that the ease of use and system integration make it a nicer prospect than it first appeared.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike our <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/\">first hands-on with the Switch 2</a>, GameChat was fully enabled for this session, which meant I was free to poke around t",

Even the relatively low $10 price tag feels too high for what is essentially a promotional tool for the system itself, walking new players through its functionality and various features with a cute and tidy presentation. Charging a premium for it--any premium, at all--is frankly confusing. All that said, now having spent some more time with Welcome Tour, I was pleased to discover one underrated utility for it: It feels primed for introducing kids (or adults) to STEM and industrial design concepts in a way that's charming and approachable through its interactivity.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The thought occurred to me as I was reading a note explaining the small, almost-imperceptible gap between the Joy-Con controllers and the body of the Switch 2.
