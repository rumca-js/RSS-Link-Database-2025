For a series that is pretty heavy on being Mil Sci-Fi where characterisation is decent but not standout Duchairn stands out as an incredible character, a nuanced take on a major religious figure made even more impressive by the fact that he is an antagonist.</p> <p>It got me thinking about other portrayals in fantasy of members of religious organisations and I couldn&#39;t think of many that stood out - often they are either fanatic monsters, dogmatic to the point of obsession or a cynical non believer. The few good religious characters i can think of tend to be relegated pretty hard to minor support roles - Father Tully in Riftwar or the Archdivine in The Curse of Chalion come to mind.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s favourites that are explicitly members of a Church-like structure, not just good characters that",

It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the entire series (that\u2019s quite a lot of books), but it\u2019d be nice to pick up the trilogy at least. I\u2018m still down for both options.</p> <p>Just to give a perspective on my reading tempo: I was thinking about finishing the first book anytime this, or at latest next month. For timezones: I\u2018m from Germany (GMT+2). And for apps: I usually track my reading using Storygraph.

It follows a multiple-POV style that a lot of her later works do, and features her trademark dreamlike prose that I just can\u2019t get enough of. What sets this one apart is that for large sections of this book, it actually feels almost \u201cnormal.\u201d The politics around the prince and the succession is pretty basic fantasy stuff \u2013well done, but a little more standard than McKillip\u2019s usually magical/bizarre setups. It also leans a little away from McKillip\u2019s other work in how dark it can be. (It\u2019s still written quite pleasantly, but a lot of the underneath subtext and referenced events can be pretty dark)</p> <p>Unlike other McKillip\u2019s magics, I found the magic in this one okay. It\u2019s very much sh",

That &quot;influence&quot; includes memories of bees, a race of humanoid characters with butterfly features, talking crabs and anything else that is very clearly based on invertebrates. My only caveat is that they must be important throughout the story. A giant spider showing up in one chapter does not qualify \u2013 unless we\u2019ve been seeing spiderwebs or other evidence of their import the entire book. </p> <p>I am now ten books down. I don\u2019t know where these ten books are going on my bingo card \u2013 or even if I\u2019ll end up using every one. My strategy is to read books that fit the invertebrate theming and figure out placement later, if I read more than 24 books, that\u2019s okay. But ten felt a good point to share some thoughts and small reviews. </p> <h1>Crypt of the Moon Spider by Nathan Ballingrud \u2013 5/5 </h1> <p><a href=\"/r/Fantasy\">r/Fantasy</a",
