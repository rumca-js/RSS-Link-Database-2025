I have recently decided to try Linux to move away from the data beast that is Windows 11. One of the main games I play is Classic World of Warcraft (I\u2019m old it\u2019s nostalgic). After eventually getting battle.net to play nicely on CachyOs I launched the game and noticed everything looked blurry and a bit washed out. The game doesn\u2019t detect my monitor LG C4 except as generic pnp. I\u2019ve faffed on with it and improved it slightly but it\u2019s way behind the image quality on Windows. Am I doing something wrong? System is running on CPU 7900X and GPU is 7900XTX. Thanks in advance. Should also say that I used my existing wow installation so perhaps it\u2019s something to do with that?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kilanthos\"> /u/kilanthos </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1l24lkf/linux_newbie_wow_question/\">[link]</a></s",

Target currently has them on sale for $50 so I&#39;m thinking about potentially just grabbing another one because I love everything about the Dualsense, however it does have one issue that&#39;s made me consider maybe looking at comparably priced third party offerings: I hate the touch pads feel and how every game defaults to that now, because I get constant issues tapping it to say, open the map in Elden Ring Nightreign, only to then get the M/K button icons to appear because it is also registered as a mouse. Mine also just regularly gets stuck and is in general kind of annoying. </p> <p>So that being said how are controllers like say, the Gamesir Cyclone 2 on linux?

Changing display using super + shift + arrows doesnt help. The only fix I have found is either disabling the 4k monitor, or disabling scaling. Both of which are far from ideal.
