Sorry folks, but I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot (probably too much) and feel I needed to get it all out.

Now as an adult I was thinking of trying to get into games that I never got to play (as well as some that I did) on older systems (NES, SNES, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, PS1, GameBoy Color, etc.) to experience them as well as serve some form of nostalgia for games I had played and had never played (or played very little at a friend/relatives house) but were around at the time that I was a kid, seeing them on TV commercials, websites, magazines, store shelves, and friends/family that had them. So I wanted to get a CRT and the systems with games so I could have the &quot;authentic retro experience&quot;.<",

It&#39;s a direct input from the the console to the PC. No splitting or multiple output signals. </p> <p>I know there are now some lightguns on the market that are compatible with flatscreens.

My CRT died again and I am not sure if I wanna go through sourcing another one.</p> <p>Folks who don\u2019t use a CRT- what is your set up? Retrotink? FPGA? Emulation?</p> <p>I currently collect NES, SNES, N64 (have an Analogue 3D pre-order but unsure we will ever see that\u2026 haha), Genesis, Dreamcast, and OG Xbox.</p> <p>In the meantime I have been playing a bunch of different cores on my docked Analogue Pocket. Which admittedly is what made me question if I want to keep playing on CRTs. I definitely enjoy the convenience but sometimes get choice paralysis and can\u2019t focus on one game. </p> <p>Any experience or advice would be really appreciated! Feeling a little lost in the options. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maddie_hhhhhhhh\"> /u/maddie_hhhhhhhh </a> <br/> <span><a href",
