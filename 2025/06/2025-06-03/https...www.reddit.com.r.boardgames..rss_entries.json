That makes this game STILL stand out - even after 30 years.</p> <p>I&#39;m so surprised by this, because every time a board game have a great success there are lots of copycats after that. The euro games are full of clones and reiterations of the same mehcanics. So why is it different with Catan and it&#39;s trading aspects.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read a dozen of threads on Reddit and BGG about people asking for games similir to Catan and... 95% of them are people recommending titles that are actually NOT like Catan :)</p> <p>I know Bohnanza which in my opinion doesn&#39;t reach the same depth. I&#39;ve hear about Ad Astra, Artemis Odyssey and Chinatown, which are hard to get.</p> <p>Do you have any games that are still available and are similar to Catan (or better) BUT specifically similar in aspect of free trading between players? </p",

The card says if you win gain 3 rage and 3 glory. So after playing this card will I be able to use the rage immediately or will the rage stat be raised?

Rather minimal and random compared to what is probably one of the best head to head games of all time. I am looking to build out a game bag and Etsy is full of tiny, portable containers for Splendor. I wouldn&#39;t mind adding it to the bag for a decent engine building game on the go for groups larger than 2. But there&#39;s go to be something to these expansions which improve the base experience. </p> <p>All of this is to say - what am I looking at with these expansions? I just saw a new one in the store! I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re not done anytime soon either. I&#39;m off to watch reviews and read up, but I appreciate whatever anyone can share with me as well! (Also, these Splendor things REALLY shrink it down an impressive amount! My new thing is finding these packs to shrink down any larger than needed box sizes.)</p> </d",

My question is: how do I play it now? I would like to be able to pick it up for a new game every now and then, but I find myself bogged down with all the various choices for ways I can modify the initial setup that I end up not taking it off the shelf at all. Is there anyone in this sub that still plays it somewhat regularly? How do you choose to modify the setup? Do I incorporate the cities/new sky tiles from the campaign? Do I incorporate scenarios or allies?
