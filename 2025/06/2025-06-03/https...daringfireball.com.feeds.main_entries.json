Watch their screencast to see what I mean.</p>\n\n<p>Four years ago I wrote a piece called \u201c<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it\">Deal With It</a>\u201d, about how\nsome UIs feel like going uphill and some feel like going downhill.\nAn uphill UI feels like you\u2019re fighting against the app; a\ndownhill UI makes it feel like the app is helping you along. The\nexample I chose to illustrate my point was event creation in iCal\n(uphill, and steep) vs. 37signals\u2019s Backpack (downhill).\nFantastical is an even better downhill UI for event creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A friend texte",

Specifically, Apple is contesting the\n<a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/19/eu-order-apple-interoperability/\">interoperability requirements</a> that say data like\nnotification content and WiFi networks should be made available to\nthird-parties.</p>\n\n<p>Apple says the DMA as written allows others to \u201caccess personal\ninformation that even Apple doesn\u2019t see\u201d. This is because features\nlike notification rendering and WiFi network data are currently\nhandled on-device and stored in an encrypted fashion, so Apple\ncannot see that stuff. However, the DMA does not necessarily\nrequire third-party agents who would be able to access this same\ndata to commit to the same standards of privacy and security.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s Apple\u2019s latest statement on the matter, in full:</p>\n\n<bl",
