I just finished reading The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store and noticed something that didn\u2019t make sense in the book\u2019s chronology toward the end of the novel. However, I can\u2019t find a single other person talking about it, and even my partner, who read the book, didn\u2019t notice, so now I\u2019m wondering if maybe I misread something. Would love to hear the thoughts and opinions of others on this topic.

Doc tells Gus that after rehearsal for the parade, he\u2019ll go get something for the nasty toe. He also tells Gus to go to Marv and get a shoe made there. End chapter. Then later on, we get a chapter where Marv goes to Issac and says that Gus came to get a shoe for his nasty foot a week ago. So, this scene must take place after Memorial Day, right? But this is also the day where Issac tells Marv to help him find two Union Jews t",

I don\u2019t know if this is a hot take, I\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m some huge Jane Austen fan - I actually was a little bit biased against her books because I felt like they all follow a theme of \u2018marriage marriage marriage\u2019 and that sort of bored me, lol. I know there\u2019s other themes to her books that make a statement on society and feminism but definitely if I was younger I would\u2019ve not been into her books at all. </p> <p>So I read Pride and Prejudice recently for the first time and I liked it. But something that came to mind randomly after reading that is how the whole genre of romance in media - films, music etc - and the way we push the idea of love just seems so distorted to me personally.</p> <p>For example, Romeo and Juliet? I know this is a tragedy not necessarily meant to be romance, but the way people depicted it as a romance, it\u2019s like to me personally, wasn\u2019t Juliet a rebound?
