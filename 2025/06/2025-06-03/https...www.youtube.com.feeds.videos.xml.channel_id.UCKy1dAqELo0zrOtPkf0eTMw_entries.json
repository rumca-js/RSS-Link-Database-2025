        "description": "Hey everyone! Today\u2019s Daily Fix: CDProjectRed released their first tech demo for The Witcher 4 at Epic\u2019s State of Unreal. They showcase footage of the game running on a PS5 ray tracing enabled and 60fps. It looks great, but is this what the game will look like on launch? The demo revealed Ciri will have a horse friend called Kelpie similar to Geralt\u2019s Roach as well as a never before seen region called Kovir.\u00a0\nAlso, Sony\u2019s State of Play happens tomorrow so we dive into what games they could be surprising us with. Will we see Naughty Dog, Bungie, Santa Monica Studios and games like Marathon, God of War, Intergalactica, Ghost of Yotei? Comment below what you think we\u2019ll see! Thanks for watching! \nAnd don't forget to grab your tickets for IGN Live happening this weekend in Los Angeles. Go to ign.com/live and use promo code \"ROLLTHETHING\" for one free ticket.\n\n#IGN",

Also available on Xbox Series S, PlayStation 5, and PC.\n\n\"F1 25 launches off the line with the first drastic shake-up of the core \u2018My Team\u2019 career mode since it was introduced in F1 2020, alongside a conclusion for the story mode that began as a short prologue way back in F1 2019 (and became a mode of its own in F1 2021). The driver career mode makes little attempt to differentiate itself from its debut in F1 24 but, when combined, F1 25 is a far broader and better package than last year\u2019s installment. There are still several areas where it hovers frustratingly short of its full potential \u2013 and I\u2019ll never be able to get behind its fascination with clothing and emotes over meaningful classic F1 cars and content \u2013 but it\u2019s comfortably the strongest the series has been since the fan favourite F1 2020.\"",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nVia the Nintendo Today app, Nintendo revealed new 60fps gameplay from the Switch 2 versions of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet & Violet. The original Switch version was plagued with performance issues, such as droppin frame rates, texture pop-in, and other problems indicative of a game not optimized and running on old hardware. Hopefully the new version will be what fans have expected. In other news, remember that James Bond game from the Hitman devs? The one they announced years ago? Well it looks like they're finally ready to show it off. The game, officially titles 007 First Light, will get a proper reveal this week. And finally, we take a peek at the five immersive worlds of the all-new Universal Epic Universe, and one of its featured attractions \u2013 Stardust Racers, all at Universal Orlando Resort. \n\nPresented by: Universal Orlando Resort, and its new theme park, Universal Epic Universe.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
