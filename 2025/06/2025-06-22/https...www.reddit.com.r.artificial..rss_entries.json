Do you know what the response was? That it was unable to help due to copyright concerns. When I tried to get it to quote anything else fun, it couldn&#39;t help. So when I got home, I asked: Is game night illegal? What about charades? Does Claude think royalties should be paid out for charades?</p> <p>Then it said: &quot;I should have just helped you immediately instead of overthinking it. Sorry I threw a wrench in your charity event,&quot; and gave me this list:</p> <ul> <li>&quot;Play it again, Sam&quot; - while pouring</li> <li>&quot;Here&#39;s looking at you, kid&quot; - classic Casablanca toast</li> <li",
