Most 360-videos are recorded on a selfie stick, or the cam is placed without trypod, people are moving, i get sea sick etc. Those videos are nice, but if you watch them with VR-glasses, it doesnt feel normal or some people have to puke. Its nothing new, and not the worlds best idea in the world, but I carry around a trypod and try to keep recording on eye-level without a moving camera.</p> <p>In my job I am traveling a lot and I already recorded many videos (just uploaded a few yet, more shall follow asap). </p> <p>So I hope this will \u201einspire\u201c more people and more will do this equally. If so, its kind a time machine, because you always can travel back to those nice places and enjoy the atmosphere , or you can show nice places to people who are not able to travel.</p> <p",

But I have a thesis I\u2019d like to share and think through with you.</p> <p>Simply put: Over the next 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, I believe education, habit-building, personal development, and skill acquisition will increasingly move into VR and simulation spaces. Growth prospects will explode here. I also think creating your own simulations will become a key part of how we learn and grow.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing many angles, and I\u2019d love your help to uncover what I\u2019m not seeing.</p> <p>This is why I want to step into VR now. I thought starting with a second-hand Quest 2 would be the easiest, most immediate entry point, with the option to upgrade later. Am I on the right track?</p> <p>Also, I\u2019m used to the openness of the internet\u2014creating, exploring, using all kinds of apps\u2014but I\u2019ve heard that VR ecosystems like Meta\u2019s are more closed.

Typically anything that requires constant or fast arm movement and where arm weights would add to the immersion. My library is small as heck so if there&#39;s an obvious game not on the list please let me know as I&#39;ve probably never heard of it. </p> <p>Good examples:</p> <p>-Synth rider/ beat saber</p> <p>-dungeons eternal</p> <p>-climb2</p> <p>These have been my go to for a work out experience and usually leave me sore.
