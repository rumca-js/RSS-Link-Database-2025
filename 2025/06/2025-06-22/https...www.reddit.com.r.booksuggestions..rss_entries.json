As a description of my tastes: i love romance and fantasy and comedy but what i really love best about a book is the characters and the plot. And possibly the narrator. I want some more books that will quite literally make me grin like an idiot. The latest that has achieved this reaction from me was the Scholomance series, because of the wit of the narration (really, so funny) coupled with the snarky and heavily pessimistic main character that says she&#39;s evil and bad and proceeds to do something completely good while swearing profusely. Another example, fanfiction this time, is The secret language of plants, by Endrina. It&#39;s a Harry Potter rewrite, but the narration here is absolutely next level. It&#39;s the humor of the original books amped up to 1000, focusing heavily on the characters, the absurdity, the development and feelings, it&#39;s honestly impossible not to fall in love",

I tend to like many different genres but I like horror, thriller, history, fantasy, things like that. Some books I have really enjoyed are The Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater, Babel by RF Kuang, The Secret History by Donna Tartt, The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, so any vibes like that would be appreciated. I tend to prefer books with LGBTQ characters, but romance does not have to be a main focus. I really am interested in Roman history and any ancient history so books with that theme would be cool.

This is my first ever Reddit post, and I thought I\u2019d kick it off by sharing a few books that meant something to me.</p> <p>Ever stumbled on a book so good you couldn\u2019t believe no one\u2019s talking about it? Same. While big-name bestsellers flood our feeds, some of the most powerful, creative, and heart-wrecking stories are quietly living their best lives in the indie corner of the publishing world.</p> <p>If you\u2019re tired of reading the same five novels being rehashed across every \u201cBest of\u201d list, allow me to introduce you to three gems that rewired my brain and maybe if you give them the chance will rearrange yours too.</p> <p>First up: \u201cThe Seven Moons of Maali Almeida\u201d by Shehan Karunatilaka. It\u2019s the kind of book that feels like it found you in the dark half ghost story, half political fever dream set in a liminal afterlife where bureaucracy is brutal and truth is slippery.
