        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently got back into reading, and after figuring out that I don&#39;t like fantasy or Sci-Fi, started reading modern fiction. The back cover of Free Food for Millionaires seemed interesting, but after reading over six hundred pages, it seemed like nothing really happened that would constitute an over-arching plot. I then moved on to Mona Acts Out, and I had the same experience (albeit it&#39;s about half the length). I&#39;m now reading The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P., and I&#39;m having roughly the same experience. It seems like these types of books are about lots of mostly mundane things happening to the protagonist without amounting to an overall plot. The books were fairly highly lauded, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something, but I can&#39;t figure out what. What am I supposed to be looking for in these types of books to properly appreciate them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jayce5",

He had a sharp eye for satire, blending grimdark fantasy with humor, bloodshed, and rich characterization in a way that felt fresh. His world-building was immersive, and his characters walked the line between archetype and realism with surprising ease.</p> <p>But as I read more widely and returned to his work with a broader perspective, I started to see the cracks. What once felt like edgy brilliance now feels like a missed opportunity. His later work, especially the Age of Madness trilogy, seems to have traded wit for a kind of modern cynicism. The humor faded, and in its place came a tone that felt like it was trying to be serious literary fiction but didn\u2019t quite land. Instead of maturing, the work feels like it drifted away from what made it compelling in the first place.</p> <p>Looking back, I still respect what Abercrombie did early on but I can\u2019t help but feel a lingering sense of what cou",

Typically the books we re-read are the ones that transcend genre, are timeless and enjoyed by multiple generations, or are just incredibly entertaining. In fact, it is rare that I re-read a book, and the one I have I can count on one hand. For example, at the top of the list is...</p> <p>_The Lord of the Rings, by JRR Tolkien (read 5 times) I read this when I was a kid and I am currently on my fifth read. Some find Tolkien&#39;s prose difficult, which I don&#39;t understand. I find it courtly and majestic, but without being overly wordy. I am not all that much into fantasy, but it seems that every fantasy book I have read since then borrows elements from here. I can also pick up any part of the trilogy at anytime I choose.</p> <p>_Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky (read 3 times) This is a book that is heavily studies by academics.
