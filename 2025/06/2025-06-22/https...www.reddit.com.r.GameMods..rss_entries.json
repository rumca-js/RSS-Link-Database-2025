It has a framework and some save editor skeletons for people to make their own game mods as well. And I will be adding more game save editing tools in the future.</p> <p>For the 360, so far, includes an STFS package explorer to inject/extract files, Account Editor, Achievement Unlocker and Avatar Award Unlocker. If you have any requests, reach to me here or on the patreon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/unknownv2\"> /u/unknownv2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1li1ett/pc_and",
