Our idea is to add money to a pool over time and the winner of our head-to-head tournament gets to use their money to purchase another board game in the end. (I hope our math works out, but it kind of doesn&#39;t matter - the purpose is to really just have some fun and play more of the games in our board game closet). </p> <p>Okay, so here&#39;s what we came up with!

Can you recommend a game for 8 people that is a bit more complicated than usual party games? Like, BGG 2-2.5 complexity. It should be also playable in one evening (best case - not more than 3 h, which excludes Eldritch Horror unfortunately). So far we have only old Citadels (2000) that kinda satisfy these requirements, and can ask friends to bring Feed the kraken. Reasons: for birthday parties we have a bunch of board gamers, and the total amount exceeds our normal playing capacity. We do not want to split into two/three groups (kind of defies the sense of a birthday party), and some people live outside the city so need to leave before midnight, hence it shouldn&#39;t take very long. And my husband totally hates party games (even Feed the kraken is sometimes too party-is for him) and prefers something bit more complicated. Hope you have some nice game ideas! Thank you very much in advance!</p> </",
