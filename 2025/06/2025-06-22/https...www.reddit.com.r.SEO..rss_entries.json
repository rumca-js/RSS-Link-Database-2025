So like it&#39;s supposed to be a concise guide for each destination like -5 Stays,5 Eats and 5 spots for each place. And no more than 1 post for each destination.<br/> I am new to SEO, but also struggling with it badly. The blog is 2 years old now, but the traffic is 1k users monthly, mostly coming from reddit.<br/> From google organic search, I only get 3-4 clicks per month, which is too bad.<br/> I have checked the search results for my kind of keywords, and I really feel my content deserves better rankings.<br/> I have few backlinks, don&#39;t really how to build them, why would someone list my website on theirs?</p> <p>I really need ideas on how can I improve SEO, but I dont want to make posts just for the sake of keywords expansion, as I really want the content of my site to be relevant.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
