This is where a big, complex fantasy world with lots of characters, cool magic, and many cultures starts\u2026 small. The first chapter or two chooses to focus on one character (or a small group). We learn only about world-building or magic that is important to this small group (often not much). And then, as the chapters go by, the cast SLOWLY increases. The world SLOWLY expands. It makes a work extremely accessible, but without sacrificing quality in any way. There is some mystery involved, questions you want to learn about, but because everything starts so small you can really focus on one or two mysteries and not be overwhelmed by hundreds of questions at once.</p> <p>The best example of this for me is \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d. The farmboy trope is a very common example of drip-feed fantasy, and WOT does it beautifully. For such a massive and overwhelming world, it starts off so e",

As a description of my tastes: i love romance and fantasy and comedy but what i really love best about a book is the characters and the plot. And possibly the narrator. I want some more books that will quite literally make me grin like an idiot. The latest that has achieved this reaction from me was the Scholomance series, because of the wit of the narration (really, so funny) coupled with the snarky and heavily pessimistic main character that says she&#39;s evil and bad and proceeds to do something completely good while swearing profusely. Another example, fanfiction this time, is The secret language of plants, by Endrina. It&#39;s a Harry Potter rewrite, but the narration here is absolutely next level. It&#39;s the humor of the original books amped up to 1000, focusing heavily on the characters, the absurdity, the development and feelings, it&#39;s honestly impossible not to fall in love",

So I am trying to expand my collection. I am primarily focused in High Fantasy, young adult to adult. Books that have overdone tropes don&#39;t really bother me, so that isn&#39;t an issue. I have had a hard time finding recommendations for books not because they aren&#39;t out there, but from subject matter. I&#39;m 27 and can handle deep themes, but I prefer to enjoy the little media I do take in for fun. I feel too much laziness in a lot of works, and it just annoys me or grosses me out. I am more than happy to engage too since it&#39;s all just opnion and taste.</p> <p>There are more I didn&#39;t list that I DNF&#39;d, but I put the popular ones. Just presume ",

But in books, it\u2019s hard to find stories that lean into that feral, primal version of the archetype. Most druids in fiction are more like forest sages or herbalists.</p> <p>I get that game classes don\u2019t always map neatly to books and that druids mean different things depending on the source or culture. But I\u2019d love to see one of the Named Men from the North in Abercrombie\u2019s First Law actually be a druid. I\u2019d love a proper druid character alongside Kinch and Galva in Blacktongue Thief. I genuinely thought Norrigal <em>was</em> a druid when she first appeared... Beorn was the closest i ever got, and he\u2019s been standing alone for decades.</p> <p>Maybe I just haven\u2019t read the books with those and you guys don\u2019t think these characters are all that rare, but i would love to know it.</p> </",

From what I saw of it there it looked like a young girl in a vaguely Scandinavian-themed world running around and encountering various creatures from mythology and folklore. The kind of animated show that\u2019s aimed primarily at a younger crowd but also offers enough to be a nice comfort watch for adults, vaguely along the lines of Gravity Falls or Adventure Time. It certainly seemed like a good show to look at for the Not a Book Bingo Square.</p> <p>And, well, that first impression was absolutely correct. Everything about the series is charming; from the characters, to the animation style, to all the various creatures that Hilda runs into.
