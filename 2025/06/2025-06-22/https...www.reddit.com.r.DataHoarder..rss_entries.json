I\u2019m planning to run Proxmox with a TrueNAS in a well-resourced VM and full hardware pass through of the HBA330. Boot is from a 2.5\u201d ssd that is directly to sata on motherboard. </p> <p>Question- Option A) 4x4tb + 4x16tb in a single zfs volume with mirrors (40tb usable, but upgrade is a pain because I have to swap all 8 drives to bigger to upgrade as I understand it) Option B) primary drive is 4x4tb in mirrors (8tb usable, good performance, cheap to source a dune if I get a failure) and snapshots/plex on 3x16tb in zraid + 1x16tb as hot spare (32tb usable, single drive fault tolerance, poorer performance) Option C) something else I\u2019m not thinking of. </p> <p>Definitely welcome any thoughts/help! I\u2019m way out of my depth!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SparhawkBlather\"> /u/SparhawkBlather </a> <br/> <span",
