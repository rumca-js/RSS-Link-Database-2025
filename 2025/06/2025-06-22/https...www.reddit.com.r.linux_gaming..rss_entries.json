The idea is to have Windows as a fallback in case something doesn\u2019t work on Linux, but I\u2019d really like to try running as much as possible directly on Linux.</p> <p>I already have many games (Steam, Epic... \u2620\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4) and some regular Windows apps installed on NTFS partitions. My questions are:</p> <ul> <li>Can I reuse those existing game installations on Linux via Proton/Wine, or do I need to reinstall everything?</li> <li>Is it possible to run them directly from NTFS, or do I really need to copy them to a native Linux filesystem?</li> <li>For non-Steam games and general apps, how well does Wine handle using already-installed Windows files from the NTFS drive?</li> </ul> <p>Any advice or experience from others who tried something similar would be greatly appreciated.

However my performance tanks from stable 110 fps (Epic DLAA 1440p) to 60 fps in Arch. I must be doing something wrong.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried a lot of different things, but most yield the same result. Here&#39;s what I tried already: - Running it with gamemode (I did confirm that gamemode was running and configured properly) - Used ProtonGE - Tried it with Vulkan and DX12 - Tried re-installing the nvidia drivers</p> <p>But now I don&#39;t know what to do.

I always wanted to try linux, I tried Ubuntu ( in which I faced issue with my pc not turning off, I had to force turn off everytime) then I tried Lonux Mint, which bombed as well. Then I read online somewhere which claimed that MSI laptops are not good for linux. I don&#39;t remember clearly the reason.</p> <p>I am not really tech savy to know much about linux, but what I am trying is to learn. To know if there&#39;s anyway to find the proper distro that works? or if anyone already knows any distro that works?. I want to get good at linux, and now that windows is stoppong windows 10 support, I think it&#39;s best I switch to linux for good. No, I don&#39;t want to get a new laptop, as this one does meet all my basic requirements still.</p> <p>Thanks for the help in advance. </p> <p>PS: A distro that still lets me play league of legen",

I dual-boot on my laptop, and now I seldomly use the Windows 11 partition for certain Microsoft-only things. I had been using Steam on Windows until I became fed up with my awful frame-rate drops. I decided to install Steam on my Linux partition and was absolutely blown away with the fact that my games run smoother, with higher texture settings, and higher frame rates! Installation was a breeze and the only hiccup I encountered was user error \ud83d\ude05 That was pretty much the nail in the coffin for me. I don\u2019t see any need for my Windows partition anymore.

I&#39;m using a lemokey p1 pro as my keyboard. It has 3 modes: wired, bluetooth, 2.4 GHz mode or whatever it&#39;s called. At the time I didn&#39;t realise I could just connect the receiver, so I download some drivers of the lemokey website. The bluetooth option for the keyboard still didn&#39;t work but I realised I can just use the receiver to connect my keyboard wire",
