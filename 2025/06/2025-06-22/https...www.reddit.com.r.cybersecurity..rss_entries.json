When using firefox, the proxy works fine, without dns leaks etc. But when Im doing nmap scans with proxychains prefix my real IP address is still shown. For best context and info to recieve help. Linux vm running a basic nmap {ip} scan with proxychains, on my home network. My real pc is a windows 11. When I pull up wireshark on my windows machine I can see the port scanning source IP as my real IP. Is this just because im scanning my own network? Or is there something I&#39;m missing. Ive configured proxychains.conf correctly as far as I know, socks4 and socks5 to the tor defaults, with dynamic chains active. Any and all help appreciated thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",
