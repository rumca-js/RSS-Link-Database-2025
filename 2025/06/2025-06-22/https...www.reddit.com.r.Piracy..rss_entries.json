I alternatively also looked at &#39;plane finder&#39;, since it has similar amounts of information, but of that app I can&#39;t even find a working apk.

On top of that, they have thousands of old comics dating back decades from every series from the early 2000&#39;s, the 90&#39;s, 80&#39;s, 70&#39;s, etc. It&#39;s like an infinite resource of comic books.

I&#39;m trying to install Revit and AutoCAD both 2025 version, being Revit 1.4 and AutoCAD 1.2. using the torrents from Monkrus. Maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong because some months ago, I installed for my wife the 2024 version and she had no problems till today. I passed the same files to her sister and it weren\u00b4t wroking because of this issue. I went beyhond and managed to get the 2025 version to her. Besides, i would loose my time on trying to figure it out myself but since we live a continent apart, it&#39;s trickier to explain these shits to her.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the problem, same problem with the instalation of the 2024 version these last 2 days. Everything goes smoothly. I install Revit and run it&#39;s crack (license), and then AutoCAD but no crack to not create confusion. With both installed and cracked, she rusn them with no internet and antivirus shutdown, goes smoothly, everything ",
