I can&#39;t seem to figure out a running dockerfile, was hoping you all could help.</p> <p>Essentially, I have the monorepo, it has 2 apps, `frontend` and `backend`, and one package, `shared-types`. The shared-types uses zod for building the types, and I use this in both the front and backends for type validation. So I&#39;m trying to deploy just the backend code and dependencies, but this linked package is one of them. What&#39;s the best way to set this up?</p> <pre><code>/ app-root |- / apps |-- / backend |--- package.json |--- package-lock.json |-- / frontend |--- package.json |--- package-lock.json |- / packages |-- / shared-types |--- package.json |- package.json |- pnpm-lock.yaml </code></pre> <p>My attempt so far - it is getting hung up on an interactive prompt while running pnpm install, and I can&#39;t figure out how to fix it. I&#39;m also not sure if this is the best way ",
