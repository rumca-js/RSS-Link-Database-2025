I in no way believe that those two portrayals are meant to be the same character. They look different, the physicality is different, and their delivery is completely different. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Benedict Cumberbatch is a talented actor, but I just don\u2019t think he should play Khan. The fact that they were playing coy in who Cumberbatch was playing in the marketing didn\u2019t help, it just makes me feel like they picked someone the complete opposite of Montalban just so they could do an underwhelming \u201ctwist\u201d reveal. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/disablednerd\"> /u/disablednerd </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1li0sh6/what_are_some_of_the_worst_casting_choices_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1li0sh6/what_are_some",

I&#39;ve always enjoyed Larry Clark&#39;s honest and graphic writing. Scenes feel very uncomfortable and surreal. </p> <p>I&#39;m not much younger than these kids (being a teen from around 03&#39; and graduating 07&#39;) but they talk and act like the same exact people I went to high school with. Same with Larry Clark&#39;s &quot;Kids&quot; which is another great film.</p> <p>We certainly didn&#39;t murder anyone like Marty and his friends did, but everything else I&#39;m afraid was spot-on. The underage drinking, really really young kids smoking weed, sex, the slang, fashion, music, everything feels like a direct callback to myself and friends alike. Terrifying at hindsight if you ask me. </p> <p>It <em>was</em> that bad, Larry Clark was just the only director with the balls to make these kinds of films.

My sister and I really enjoy the older slapstick style movies, like Naked Gun or Hot Shots. I&#39;m going to visit her next month, and would like to show her kids (6, 8, and 10) something along those lines. Does anyone have any suggestions that might not offend the censors too much? I realized what is and isn&#39;t acceptable changes as time goes on, and I don&#39;t have kids, so I&#39;m at the mercy of the Internet here.

I forgot how little it was. On the one hand it seems like too little if you&#39;re not in high school but on the other hand it&#39;s interesting to watch a movie where the characters put up with so much for so little. Not a criticism exactly, just caught my eye.
