She set up a Gofundme to afford catching the guy. I was about to donate myself because I felt bad but the videos seemed a bit vague and I suddenly doubted her. There isn&#39;t much proof that she could provide other than glitching screens and saying she can&#39;t type properly on the screen. I&#39;m a bit skeptical but also curious if this is actually possible. I don&#39;t believe she downloaded any sort of malware or anything either. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lotta-Bank-3035\"> /u/Lotta-Bank-3035 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lg02ix/is_it_really_possible_for_someone_to_hack_into/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lg02ix/is_it_really_possible_for_someone_to_hack_into/\">[com",
