A scientist's frustrating experience in an exercise class with his mother-in-law where her effort wasn t reflected on the fitness leaderboard sparked a breakthrough. His team at Northwestern developed a new open-source smartwatch algorithm that accurately captures energy expenditure for individuals with obesity, rivaling gold-standard lab equipment and paving the way for more inclusive, empowering health tracking.",

Tracking nearly 5,800 patients, researchers found a direct link between weight loss and rising confidence, with the greatest psychological boosts seen in those who lost the most weight. Despite differences in gender, race, or procedure type, patients across the board reported profound improvements in self-worth. The findings shine a spotlight on how addressing weight stigma through surgery can dramatically reshape not just bodies but minds.",
