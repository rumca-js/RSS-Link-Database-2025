        "description": "Caffeine, the world's most popular psychoactive substance, is best known for blocking adenosine receptors in the brain\u2014reducing fatigue and enhancing alertness. But its benefits go beyond wakefulness: it also improves focus, reaction time, mood, and mental clarity. Interestingly, not all caffeine sources are created equal. Green tea contains not only caffeine but also L-theanine, an amino acid absent in coffee. L-theanine tempers caffeine's side effects\u2014like jitteriness and anxiety\u2014while enhancing its cognitive benefits. Together, they work synergistically to boost performance and smooth out the typical caffeine crash. This combination helps maintain longer-lasting focus and energy with fewer drawbacks, making green tea an especially effective and balanced nootropic.",
