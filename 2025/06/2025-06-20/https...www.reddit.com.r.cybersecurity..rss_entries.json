This week alone, I\u2019ve received the same type of alert three times, each involving a different user and a different file share:</p> <p><strong><em>Abnormal behavior: access to an unusual amount of idle data</em></strong><br/> <strong><em>(Meaning the user accessed a large number of dormant files in a short time \u2014 between 1,000 and 4,000 files in under 10 minutes.)</em></strong></p> <p>I reached out to the users involved. Two of them confirmed they did access some files during that time, but estimated only around 10\u201320 files \u2014 far fewer than what Varonis reported (which was over 1,200).<br/> The third user said he didn\u2019t access anything at all.</p> <p>So my questions are:</p> <ul> <li>Is this a common issue? Have others noticed Varonis reporting unusually high file access counts?</li> <li>Could Varonis be overestimating access for some reason",
