Autodesk Fusion was previously installed but we don\u2019t even use it. I\u2019ve attempted to both repair and uninstall Autodesk Fusion, but I consistently run into \u201cAccess Denied\u201d errors, likely due to restricted permissions. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t reach the school\u2019s IT administrator since it\u2019s summer break, and unless I find a workaround, I\u2019ll be stuck with this issue for over two months. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.
