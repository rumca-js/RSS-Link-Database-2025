After your device is registered as a passkey, login requests will route a notification to that device, which you can approve using a PIN code, your face, or your fingerprint. If you\u2019re activating passkeys in your Facebook mobile app, you\u2019ll probably use the phone itself as a passkey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because passkeys cannot be reused or stolen through phishing, they\u2019re a much more secure alternative to traditional passwords.

Today I\u2019m going to show you how to set apps to not load on startup in Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>App developers usually program their apps to load and open by default when you boot into Windows, which puts them front and center. But in my experience, they often just get in the way and block the view of my desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a bunch of apps load on startup can also significantly increase boot times, and how long it takes for your computer to feel responsive after loading. They also delay me doing what I want to do immediately. I\u2019m forced to either laboriously close them down or else acknowledge a prompt before I can do anything on my PC. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now I stop loading most of my apps on startup and just run them when I need them. I hit my laptop lickity split now. Better yet, it just takes a simple step to set it up!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-blo",
