But honestly, using them on a laptop feels like a struggle.</p> <p>My biggest issue? The keyboard is right up against the screen, and I constantly find myself hunched over or hitting the wrong keys because of the cramped layout. It feels awkward trying to do all these hotkey combos without a proper distance between me and the screen. And don&#39;t get me started on using Super + arrow or Super + shift + something combos while squished up against a 14-inch display.</p> <p>It almost feels like tiling WMs are made for desktops with external keyboards and big monitors. Anyone else feel the same? Am I missing some ergonomic trick, or is an external keyboard just mandatory for a good experience?</p> <p>Would love to hear how you laptop-only users manage it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",
