Without a valid passcode, any connection attempt will fail\u2014user B won\u2019t even be notified. Which means there&#39;s no spam messages, not even any spam requests.</p> <p>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I like the concept of copyleft, but GPL is scary, both for a publisher (I can&#39;t properly understand what are my responsibilities as a publisher and for the others). I&#39;ve found weak copyleft licenses as a cool middle ground. MPL doesn&#39;t look to be as popular, but it&#39;s less intimidating, and LGPL has the backing of FSF, so it should be more respected and popular.<br/> On the other hand, i seriously LOVE the MIT license, it&#39;s just simple and easy, and it&#39;s like &quot;do whatever, just don&#39;t sue me!&quot;. BSD 3 and 2 seems also cool, even if i don&#39;t understand how they really differ from MIT.</p> <p>Generally speaking I like the concept of weak copyleft, but I also want to avoid the most of the hassle that they could involve as a publisher.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/francocicciociccione\"> /u/francocicciociccione </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
