I owned it maybe around 2008 to 2010, somewhere around there. The box was blue and the art on it was 2 monsters fighting each other, one of which was a hydra (i think, but my brain may be deceiving me). I believe damage counters were involved in gameplay if that helps. Please help me!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive-Demand538\"> /u/Aggressive-Demand538 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lft3t9/help_me_remember_what_this_game_is_please/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lft3t9/help_me_remember_what_this_game_is_please/\">[comments]</a></span>",
