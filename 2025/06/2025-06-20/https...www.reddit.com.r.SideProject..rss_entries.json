It got me thinking: what if creators had a better way to share and monetise their recipes?</p> <p>So I built Dishy - a link-in-bio tool made specifically for recipe creators. You can import recipes directly from TikTok or Instagram, customise your page in minutes, and even monetise with recipe subscriptions.</p> <p>The goal is to make it dead simple for food creators to grow their audience and actually earn from what they create without needing to set up their own website.</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts on the idea.

It\u2019s called Badgesheet and it\u2019s going live tomorrow, but you can test it early here: <a href=\"https://badgesheet.vercel.app/\">https://badgesheet.vercel.app</a></p> <p>If you want to try it out, use this test login:</p> <p>Email: [<a href=\"mailto:reddit@reddit.com\">reddit@reddit.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:reddit@reddit.com\">reddit@reddit.com</a>)</p> <p>Password: reddit</p> <p>It\u2019s not a free tool, but I\u2019ve kept pricing super light mostly to cover hosting and keep things sustainable. The idea is to help event organizers, teachers, or even small teams quickly generate badges without needing to wrestle with templates or design tools. Everything happens in your browser and you get a print-ready sheet instantly.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, whether",
