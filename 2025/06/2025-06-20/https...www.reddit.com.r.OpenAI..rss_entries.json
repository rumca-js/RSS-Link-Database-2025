By far the worse is in o4-mini and mini-high, where it gives only a very basic and dismissive paragraph before throwing the ball back at you and not really completing the query you\u2019ve asked it.</p> <p>Unfortunately now its also deteriorating in the normal 4o model. I used to have it in my ear, discuss ideas and plans and it would feed me such a long text that had everything i asked it and more, now, same crap, dismissive, non-helpful paragraph, albeit a bit longer.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also compared the actual audio to what it transcribes and noticed some omission bugs. Asked it to list me 100 names, and so it started saying \u201cnumber 1 - John, number 2 - amber\u2026\u201d and so on. And Ive noticed that a few times it would completely skip a name, but it appeared later on in the transcript.</p> <p>Honestly OpenAi should focus on bug fixes instead of new models, as in 1 year, chatgpt and all the models suffered some major handicaps.</p>",
