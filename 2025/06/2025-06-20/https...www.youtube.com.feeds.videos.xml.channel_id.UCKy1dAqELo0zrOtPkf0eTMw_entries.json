        "description": "Splitgate 2 reviewed by Jarrett Green on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.\nSplitgate 2 is a competent successor to the original that expands on it, but never really surpasses it. There still are few shooters you can play right now that feel as good as this one does to jump, float, and slide around in, and the new class system adds a tactical layer that sort of sacrifices the original\u2019s philosophy of simplicity for the sake of mechanical depth. Weapons are good if largely uninspired (outside of the small handful of bangers you have to fight over in matches). But the map selection is a definite step backwards, both aesthetically and in the way they seem to discourage regular use of the shooter\u2019s signature portals. Even though it packs in a lot of modes and content in a fair free-to-play game, the effort to bring Splitgate 2 more in line with other popular shooters has taken it a step too far away from what made the original a cult hit.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
