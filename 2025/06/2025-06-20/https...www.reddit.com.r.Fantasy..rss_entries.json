Ed McDonald is almost as good but I&#39;ve read all of his stuff. Maas is good but the focus on romance gets a little tedious. Plus I&#39;ve read crescent City and throne of Glass already.

It was an easy and overall enjoyable read with lots of classic fantasy tropes and passable characters. Not spectacular, but not terrible either. I don&#39;t really feel like continuing the books though. The story was predictable and the writing style was pretty simple. Now I want to try The Echoes Saga and would like to hear your thoughts on the series. Is it worth reading? I&#39;ve seen some people compare it to Riyria. Is the prose better? What about the plot, characters, pacing?</p> <p>Really want to read something in the veins of LotR, but not its complete copy and preferably something more modern.

And I&#39;m really excited to give her a go.</p> <p>With that said, I tend to avoid certain topics in my books (or at least like to be aware of them going forward). So, what kind of content warnings are there for the Deryni series? How dark/graphic is it? Specifically, does it contain on-page rape scenes at all?

But I have been noticing, that Honor concepts in for example the mediterranean and middle east, places we focus on, differ wildly from the ones I know from fantasy literature. While Honor in these regions seems to be linked to sexuality, shame and the general opinion, that does not seem to be the case in fantasy.

I got asked to write an article that overlaps with literature and for some reason I thought of the combo Conan+alcohol as a lot of things are inspired from historical cultures and I can draw gorgeous parallels.</p> <p>But last time I read any Howard was like, 20 years ago. So, I ask thee. Do you have any particular passages, references, stories that portray the characters drinking? Or even better, mentions of beer, or cultures that have ales and/or meads? Any medium is alright, I got access to pretty much everything ever published (I think).</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sagjer\"> /u/sagjer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lfyut9/historian_looking_for_a_couple_of_conan_references/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/",

Multiple times tension comes up because she just doesn\u2019t do or think of things that a normal person would. This happens often in the back half of the book.

Then, about three years ago, in an effort to follow through on my promise, I picked up bind-up of the first three <em>Foundation</em> books for exactly 2 dollars, priced so due to the weird-looking stain on the front that may be chocolate or may be something else.
