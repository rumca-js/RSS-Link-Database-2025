I&#39;ve success with: ping pi -n 1. On OS lite specifically with Zero2W. But I would be fibbing if I said I knew why it works for me. I&#39;m just curious if you guys have a more colloquial or reliable way. I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m finalizing a write-up for a fun personal project I&#39;ve been working on. And I don&#39;t want to steer people wrong, just because this works for me. I&#39;d like to share it for the community here when I&#39;m done; so I want to make sure I offer up the most reliable way to perform this. And not just what works for me. I&#39;d appreciate any insight to better methods! Thank you very much, I&#39;m grateful for this community and the inspiration that I find here!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Yikes-Cyborg-Run\"> /u/Yikes-Cyborg-Run </a> <br",

Been spending a few days trying to understand why the phenomenal Sensirion SGP40 on an Adafruit breakout won&#39;t show up in <code>i2cdetect</code>.</p> <p>At first I thought it was a faulty unit. So I got a new one and it still didn&#39;t show. Adafruit&#39;s own libraries worked on it which left me confused. Turns out, the SGP40 does not respond immediately to an I2C command as it uses clock stretching. So I decided to run a manual I2C scan using python. Ran through every address and attempted to write AND wait for an ACK. Found my SGP40 there.</p> <p>Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone has this trouble in future. Couldn&#39;t see anything online explaining about this.
