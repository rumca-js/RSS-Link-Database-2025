In 1972, he became the first Black artist to represent the US at the world\u2019s most prestigious art festival, the Venice Biennale. He had overcome poverty and prejudice in the south to study art at one of the first desegregated universities, and, after settling in Washington, was hailed as a radical innovator within the group of abstract painters dubbed the Color School.</p><p>Pushing his medium in new sculptural directions, he broke convention by taking his canvases off their wooden stretchers. His best-known colour-drenched works have an improvisatory quality, never installed the same way twice, whether they\u2019re draped on the wall or hung tent-like from the ceiling.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/20/sam-gilliam-art",

First, bandleader Will Anderson is in love, which alleviates some of the gloom that pervaded earlier records.

Where previous albums had been one-man affairs, with Anderson overdubbing layer upon layer of guitar and synth on his lonesome, the presence of other musicians in the room has shaken up the paradigm. Their trademark walls of fuzz remain, but Raspberry Moon also fields tracks such as Break Right, on which the happy/sad melodies",
