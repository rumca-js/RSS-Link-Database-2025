First time here :) I\u2019m 28F, very deeply in therapy, very deeply realising that I never tell people no or hold any boundaries in the moment. I\u2019m working through it 1/1 with my therapist but if there\u2019s anything others would recommend I would love to hear it. Specifically being direct about actually saying no to others and being in touch with what you want. I read a lot but generally fiction any help/recs would be welcome. Also podcast/other resource recs welcome.

I was reading an article about dystopias/utopias in the Palestinian imagination and since i&#39;ve been on the look for theological/cosmological horror books lately it got me thinking about ones written by specific ethnic groups to try to see what the collective imagination in that field would be like, given the history of that group. Obv it doesn&#39;t mean books written only in the place of origin of these authors or in their origin&#39;s tongue (in fact, it can&#39;t be since i can only read English and Arabic). i know it might be a bit of a narrow circle to find many works in, but any and all recommendations are greatly appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/a-bag-of-jellybeans\"> /u/a-bag-of-jellybeans </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lge0k3/theologicalcosmological_horror_reccs_written_by/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"http",

But I want to read a book or manga that has a romance plot but messes with the readers head and forces you to think about yourself. Idk I wanted something to fuck with my brain is that too much to ask \ud83d\ude2d and maybe something that gets you thinking about yourself and your relationship I like the fact the flowers of evil has the story line of the main character not knowing what they want and he torn between two girls but in reality it\u2019s a double meaning.

I decided to try for 15k steps each day. I am an avid reader anyhow and thought listening to audiobooks can be a great way to combine two good things, but I realized that books you really want to focus on (and in my case mark pages, take notes) are not ideal for listening while walking. So - please recommend something that is super fun and the time flies with it. I am not opposed to any genre or to listening to a series etc. Thank you in advance, good people! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nenenah\"> /u/Nenenah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lg84zq/book_recommendation_for_walking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I am starting to feel that i am speaking for too long to say something which might be boring my client or bosses. They don&#39;t say it up front or my sales aren&#39;t affected yet, but i do believe i need to start concising my thought process so that i can communicate better. I have always been a wordsmith of sorts and haven&#39;t had issues with communication but i want to be more effective when it comes to sales now.

Compared to clicking the new sci-fi tab and you have all these contemporary writers who may note be going viral on tiktok but who are writing good science fiction.

This type of style is something I have always been looking for. I am looking for a series that has technology being a core focus of the story, but not sci Fi where the technology is fictional and vague, I want real technology that is described in detail as the story progresses, and continually evolves along with the narrative.
