Their designs can vary, from large humanoid robots and war tanks to large drones or even insect-sized killing machines.

By the enormity of the investments, it appears that Big-Tech has monopolized the AI space through its control of these mega assets (Data centers and energy access). This is a highly centralized model of an AGI. It facilitates millions of users per day. It&#39;s a shared cloud space entity. My question is: When &quot;local &amp; decentralized&quot; artificial intelligences begin to dominate, will their basic structure still be through human language on-board transformers? Afterall, bouncing communication off of the cloud and back might affect latency potentially rendering certain mission critical systems to be too slow. Thus, we will likely be using several different techniques where language isn&#39;t a part of the things. And then...will we see the mega data centers become obsolete...or perhaps just repurposed away from ",
