        "description": "The Chinese Room's Still Wakes the Deep represented a solid, if somewhat traditional, first-person horror experience, one centred on the Beira D and its infestation by a hostile entity. Given its mix of tension and tragedy, the plot felt complete but still left plenty of room open for addressing various mysteries.\n\nSiren's Rest, the first story DLC, unfortunately, doesn't delve into them. Occurring over 10 years later, it focuses on a new character named Mhairi, a diver seeking to explore the wreckage with her crew and find answers. The underwater exploration is a new touch, but for the first hour or so, there's little more than opening doors and photographing corpses involved.\n\nThe tension does somewhat ratchet up later, and gameplay is a bit more diverse, but Siren's Rest fails to deliver on its premise, instead focusing on a more personal tale.

        "description": "So, you've seen the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. You didn't play the original for whatever reason but between the giant kaiju battles, dynamic weather, and highway chases \u2013 not to mention the lack of many first-party PS5 exclusives \u2013 you're intrigued.

It starts in unorthodox fashion with protagonist Sam Porter Bridges venturing through a vibrant, mountainous region (which bears more than a passing resemblance to Norway but don't worry about it). As his name indicates, Sam is a porter who delivers packages through rain, sleet, and snow. Except, as we soon learn in the opening, the rain will age and eventually kill you, as it does to several birds mid-flig",
