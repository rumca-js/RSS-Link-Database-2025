Right now, I have a Raspberry Pi handling Pi-hole for DNS. At home, we usually have around 7-8 devices connected to the internet.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m considering:</p> <ol> <li><strong>OPNsense directly on Windows 11 Pro, with Stirling PDF in a VM:</strong> This seems straightforward since Windows is already installed.</li> <li><strong>Both OPNsense and Stirling PDF running in separate VMs:</strong> This feels like it might be more isolated, but I&#39;m not sure about the resource usage.</li> </ol> <p>What do you think is the best approach for my home setup? Any tips or gotchas I should be aware of as ",
