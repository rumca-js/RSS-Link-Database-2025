I statically link my program against any libraries it may need at built-time using a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/\">multi-stage build</a> and <code>COPY</code> <em>only</em> the resulting binary to an empty image, and it just works. Zero vulnerabilities, 20 KiB\u2013images (sometimes even less!) that start instantly. Debugging? No problem: either maintain a separate <code>Dockerfile</code> (it\u2019s literally just a one-line change: <code>FROM scratch</code> to <code>FROM alpine</code>) or use a sidecar image.</p> <p>Why isn\u2019t this the norm?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/azaroseu\"> /u/azaroseu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1lgh",

I made changes to my Go app, and then I <code>docker compose up --build</code> but then it restarts the Postgres container, doesn&#39;t it?
