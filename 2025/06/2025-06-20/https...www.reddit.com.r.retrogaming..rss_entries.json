The basic rundown is I&#39;m going to have a NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii, Xbox 360 Slim, PS3 Slim, Wii U, Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam Deck hooked up to a Retrotink 4k CE. The things I need that I don&#39;t know what to get is a HDMI switch and a SCART switch. </p> <p>Currently, this is the cable setup I&#39;ve chosen: NES(+mod): SCART SNES: SCART N64(+mod): SCART Gamecube: Carby+HDMI Wii: YPbPr component Everything Else: HDMI</p> <p>So I think that what I&#39;ll do is hook up the Wii directly to the Retrotink and have all the other consoles on either a SCART or HDMI switch. Any reccomendations for switches or for changing the setup? Tempted to not run any mods and just use composite for NES and S-Video for N64.

So I&#39;m definitely going to play more of this over the weekend. I&#39;m used to old school JRPGs so it doesn&#39;t feel grindy or boring. I just hate that there are two &quot;cancel&quot; buttons when going through menus and the one I&#39;m used to pressing (circle) completely backs out of whatever menu tree I&#39;m in. I&#39;m also still getting used to the isometric view and how it maps to the directional button. But I&#39;m enjoying the game so far, so I don&#39;t mind the wasted time going back and forth through the menu options.</p> <p>What about you guys?
