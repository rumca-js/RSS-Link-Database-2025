The only way to fix this is to either delete the token from the browser&#39;s localStorage or clear the cache/cookies, which is obviously not ideal for users.</p> <p>So my question is: how would I go about fixing this? Is there a proper way to handle expired tokens automatically? And is it safe to just regenerate the token when I get this &quot;Token Valid but expired&quot; error?</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking maybe I should implement refresh tokens or set up some kind of interceptor to catch these errors and automatically refresh the token, but I&#39;m not sure what the best practice is",
