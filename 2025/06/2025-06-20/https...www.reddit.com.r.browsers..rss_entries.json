I also recommend you use an external password manager app with it as I removed the internal password manager so people can use their passwords from their manager or chrome. I submitted to Windows store as well so hopefully today or early next week I am live on that too. I appreciate any support or feedback anyone wants to give so I can make the browser better as I&#39;ve been dealing with malware infections on the server from people trying to stop my development work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Embarrassed-Tart-554\"> /u/Embarrassed-Tart-554 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.dankium.browser\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1lg9juc/dankium_now_live_on_google_p",

It&#39;s that firefox just sucks on Android! I&#39;m sick of pretending it isn&#39;t! yeah it &quot;works&quot; enough of the time, probably even works perfectly for a lot of you. But I&#39;m not you. It&#39;s not enough that websites are like, 80, 90, 9X% of the way there, it&#39;s just that one or a few features don&#39;t work, or are goofed up. But I want that feature that doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s why I&#39;m on the website. For the one fucking feature that&#39;s a part of the X% that&#39;s fucking fucking up.
