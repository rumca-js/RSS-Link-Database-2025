The audiobook narrator Sarah Coomes was perfect as well. She captures Jane&#39;s emotions so well.</p> <p>At the beginning of the book , The author really wants us to empathise with her struggles and pain. Her story is a painful one especially for a 10 year old. Moving to Lowood betters her prospects a bit and I want to specifically mention Helen Burns. I was so captivated by this character, her ideologies and how she shapes Jane&#39;s thinking. Chapter 6 remains my favourite. The part about Helen&#39;s struggles and the whole conversation about Matthew 5 v 44 really infixed into my brain. I greatly admired her and shed a tear at her demise. Though I think this was the build up to her death, to heighten emotional tension. Well done , Charlotte.</p> <p>No more , simply magnificent.
