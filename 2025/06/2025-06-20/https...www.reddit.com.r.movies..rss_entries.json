So were the Engineers speeding things up, like &quot;hey, let&#39;s skip to fish&quot;? If so, that would presuppose that the genes we share in common with plants &amp; other non-animal life are actually conserved across the galaxy, which would be pretty cool. But of course the movie doesn&#39;t get into any of that, &amp; eventually forgets how cartographers &amp; biologists work, or that you should run in a 90-degree angle when a giant donut is rolling toward you.

If you ask anyone in France if they have heard of the Kirikou cartoon, it is very unlikely that they will say no. I remember seeing it when I was little, and a few years later I realised how visually stunning it is, one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen to date. The details of the leaves, tree trunks and sand are so well crafted, and the colours are vivid, bright, brilliant and beautiful, reflecting a sense of harmony. I would be thrilled if director Michel Ocelot were to release a 4K re-release. And you guys, what is the animated film, or non-animated film, with the visuals that have most impressed and blown you away, and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Saitamashock\"> /u/Saitamashock </a",

Some films got unanimously great reviews from critics but audiences were polarized or downright hate the film. Other movies are hated both by critics and audiences equally. </p> <p>What are some movies that got mixed (not completely negative, but not unanimously positive either) reviews from critics but seem to have no haters from the general public? </p> <p>Some that come to mind: just about everyone I&#39;ve seen loves The Secret Life of Walter Mitty with Ben Stiller. Although critics were split on this one, the general audience seems to find it deeply impactful and moving.</p> <p>Home Alone&#39;s critical reception, especially early on was mixed, but it&#39;s a Christmas classic for the ages.</p> <p>I think About Time from 2013 could be another example, it&#39;s adored by everyone, although critical reception was like ok. </p> <p>What are some others?

But it&#39;s made me want more projects like this, give me movies with experimental bizarre visuals, they don&#39;t have to make any sense, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s foreign even, as long as it has English subtitles or at least I can sort of follow what&#39;s going on through the visuals. (already seen Xavier btw, I know that&#39;s a show but that&#39;s super classic bizarre media for me). If you have any games you could think of, then please shoot me a message in my DMs. </p> <p>Edit: Wow, you guys work fast, deeply deeply appreciated, I feel I should add this I don&#39;t mind movies that use ai, but I want it to be used as a tool instead of an entire movie made by ai, unless if it&#39;s a really wild fever dream to watch. Honestly, I&#39;ll take any thing I&#39;ll can get, if posting AI here is not all",
