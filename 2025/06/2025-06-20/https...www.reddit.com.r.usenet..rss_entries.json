Just to clear things up: <strong>that\u2019s not the case</strong>.</p> <p>EasyUsenet is operated by XS News B.V., a Netherlands-based company that\u2019s been around since 2007. While it\u2019s true that we (like many others) use the Abavia backbone, that doesn\u2019t mean we share business practices or customer policies with those providers.</p> <p>In short: <strong>same infrastructure \u2260 same company</strong>.</p> <p>We\u2019ve always focused on keeping things simple and fair \u2014 no hidden fees, misleading &quot;free&quot; trials and easy cancellation directly from your account. Also: in 15+ years, we\u2019ve never had a single debt collection case. We&#39;re proud of that.</p> <p>More information below</p> <p>If you\u2019ve got questions, feel free to drop them here. We\u2019re open to discussion and appreciate the feedback \u2014 even the critical stuff. </p> <p",
