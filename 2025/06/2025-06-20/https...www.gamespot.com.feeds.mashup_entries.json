It's a middle finger to everybody. When Duke Nukem blew up, a bunch of people sat around trying to turn it into a brand, when it's just a middle finger. Duke Nukem can't be made by a corporation, because the moment a corporation makes Duke Nukem, it's no longer Duke Nukem.

He identified a number of issues with the way Nintendo has implemented its HDR, mostly coming down to confusing UI and a lack of clear instruction.</p><p>The first issues come from the settings menu that prompts you to calibrate HDR for a new display.
