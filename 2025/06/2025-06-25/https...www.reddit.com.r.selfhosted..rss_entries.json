I thought a good solution might be to use an SMTP service and chose SMTP2GO as a trial. It was easy to add the domain and a few select individuals to their &quot;verified senders&quot; tab and when those people send mail to the membership list it works great.

The problem comes with aliases and what I&#39;ll call inbound lists.</p> <p>For example, there&#39;s an alias for [<a href=\"mailto:president@thisorg.org\">president@thisorg.org</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:president@thisorg.org\">president@thisorg.org</a>) that points to the president&#39;s personal email.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a home server that I&#39;m using DuckDNS and Nginx Proxy Manager (just standard Nginx install and a text config file). I am using FileBrowser as a web based file manager for my NAS.</p> <p>What I&#39;ve noticed is that when I access the server via the DuckDNS address (and hence through Nginx proxy using a subdomain name), I have a severe upload limit of about like 2 mb or so. But when I access the server bypassing DuckDNS and the proxy, using just the IP of the server, I have no upload limit.</p> <p>The Nginx error log was confirming it &quot;client intended to send too large body: 10485760 bytes&quot;</p> <p>Is this a problem with DuckDNS or a problem with Nginx Proxy Manager? I looked and there is no &quot;max body size&quot; or any other setting in the nginx.conf file or my proxy config file.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ReesesGoblin\"> /u/ReesesGoblin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:/",
