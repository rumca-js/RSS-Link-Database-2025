I offer everything from these sections:</p> <ul> <li>Virtual Assistance</li> <li>Web &amp; Tech</li> <li>Marketing</li> <li>Content</li> <li>Multimedia</li> <li>Coaching</li> </ul> <p>I had a hand full of freelancers that worked for me, so I could cover all sections. But since ChatGPT, Deepseek, etc. I almost don&#39;t get any customers now, because now you can do almost everything through AI. I had an income at around 1,5-2,5k \u20ac per Month, and now just a few hundred \u20ac. Not enough to live. All my savings are now away, I even opened up an gofundme link, but nobody is helping me on that too. So I don&#39;t really know what to do at the moment. </p> <p>But do you guys think, there is any possibility to save my company again? Because I&#39;m trying since months, but I can&#39;t get any further. I really don&#39;t know what to do at this point</p> <p>Edit: I already",
