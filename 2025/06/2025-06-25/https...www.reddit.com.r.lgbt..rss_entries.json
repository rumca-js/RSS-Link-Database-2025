In 2022, Russia passed a law banning, pay attention: &quot;ORGANIZATION&quot; LGBT (or something similar). Let&#39;s close our eyes to the wording. The point is that LGBT has been equated with extremism and now people are actually being jailed and given huge fines for &quot;propaganda&quot; of LGBT: even if some hypothetical gay couple goes out on the street holding hands, they will be accused of propaganda, put in jail, or something even worse. many people were imprisoned completely unjustifiably. As for society: you will be lynched on the spot. They will beat you up, break your bones and leave you lying on the street without even calling an ambulance. But if they do call, hope that they won&#39;t find out why you were beaten, because neither the cops or the doctors will help you. As a trans person I can",
