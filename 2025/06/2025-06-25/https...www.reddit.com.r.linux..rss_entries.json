Keep in mind I don\u2019t have a full browser, and use Dillo, which has no JavaScript and I can\u2019t look at a lot of websites when I\u2019m using it. 400mb ram, i use zram but it isn\u2019t really practical for modern browsers still.</p> <ol> <li><p>Copy and paste. never thought I\u2019d have trouble with such a simple command. I don\u2019t wanna make it too complicated, if I could have a clipboard with clipboard history so I could copy and paste from a long list of things that would be helpful. but also if I could just get copy and paste to work using control, see control V that would be convenient. It seems to work only like half the time and for some reason works with my mouse, but not after highlighting text and using control C and control V.</p></li> <li><p>",

Everytime some controversial change gets proposed on Fedora, someone reports on it without making it clear that it only <em>may</em> get through after enough thought and discussion, and the entire comment section devolves into people yelling about this and that even though literally anybody can propose a change over there. And alot of the time those proposals don&#39;t even get through.</p> <p>I get that potential major change is big news and a good source for discussions but dear god in the past week alone I&#39;ve seen two different news about a Fedora change proposal where people act like the developers have already decided on it and it has zero pushback and is going to happen soon (removing 32-bit support being one of them). I don&#39;t even use Fedora but it gets really annoying. Atleast make it clear.</p> <p>With that said I realized that readers will probably just be stupid and will overreact regardless but I don&#39;t think it hurts",

My goal is to be a network guy but I also want to be proficient in Linux since most of the servers will most likely utilize Linux I was thinking of getting the comptia Linux plus certification or going the red hat route. I need to start off with something basic and I was wondering how difficult these certs are compared to ccna. I found ccna to be pretty difficult but I did pass on my first go.
