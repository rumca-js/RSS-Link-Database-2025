Rain, frost, monkeys stealing your precious supplies, tiger encounter during the hunt (sure, you will kill him and get meat, but will be severely wounded in the process, most likely) - and days left to complete your task are ticking away... </p> <p>There is quite a few randomness by euro standards (damn this clumsy carpenter and weather dice). However at the same time gameplay feels pretty railroaded: in each scenario there is a clear path to victory, and if you don&#39;t stick to it, you will most likely lose.

So far I got interested in Inis, Rising Sun and Blood rage, though more people in my local area have blood rage and haven\u2019t played the other two. That brings me to the question in the title that might be misleading, i\u2019m not looking for a scythe replacement. I\u2019m looking for a generally good war game and just happened to see Blood rage rising sun and inis first.

Except, I was wrong as the end goal is not to deduce your partner&#39;s secret objectives, the goal is to meet them.</p> <p>After watching a few gameplay videos, I noticed that many games seemed to be won through trial and error, rather than actual deduction. Players often win the game without truly deducing the other player&#39;s secret objectives, but simply by trying different configurations until they find a working configuration without having deduced the other player&#39;s objectives. For the whole game, you are proposing new configurations based on trial and error rather than on deduced general rules.</p> <p>Do you know of any 2-player games with a similar concept\u2014whe",

We went to a local board game shop and tried to play pandemic, Jaipur, azul, hive, and nothing really hit. And I get that it&#39;s probably more us than the games. But they all felt confusing. We picked up ticket to ride and that was fun. Same with codename duet. I&#39;m not sure what it is but starting some of these games feels confusing and we&#39;re just looking for something easy that makes us laugh for 30-60 minutes. Any help or suggestions is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PiBolarBear\"> /u/PiBolarBear </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lju2wa/struggling_to_find_an_easy_fun_2_person_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lju2wa/struggling_to_find_an_easy_fun_2_person_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",
