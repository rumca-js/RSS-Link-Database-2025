I don&#39;t know how many people need this, but in Source Engine games, when joining servers that use custom textures, a lot of maps will have missing textures due to Linux case sensitivity. This has been an issue since I think around December of 2024. I haven&#39;t really seen anyone talk about it around here, but I figured I&#39;d post the fix here in case anyone needs it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/scorpius2k1/linux-bsp-casefolding-workaround\">https://github.com/scorpius2k1/linux-bsp-casefolding-workaround</a></p> <p>Disclaimer: I am not the person who made the fix.

I\u2019m thinking maybe a configuration problem? On Windows I am seeing 102 average fps in the benchmark but only around 75-85 average fps in Linux through Steam. I am using stock Proton and have tried RADV and amdvlk drivers. Also image quality is not as good. I also notice similar in GTA 5. My expectation for image quality is an unimplemented API in Proton however running under gamescope looks better.

However, the current client used by turtle wow is ancient, has a few bugs and bad performance, so I would like to mod it. There are 4 mods I want to load, but 2 of them do not work for me.</p> <p>I must run the game through flatpak, but I talked to many players who use native proton-ge/Heroic launcher etc, and mods work for them. If you have modded the game successfully, but you don&#39;t use flatpak, then you may not be able to help. I assume that it may be a sandbox issue, but I don&#39;t know how to test that.</p> <p>The mods for Turtle wow are dll&#39;s injected by the launcher (WoW.exe). There is a <code>dll.txt</code> file that you can use to list which dlls to load.</p> <p>I made a post on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/turtlewow/comments/1ljqoxa/how_to_use_mods_when_running_twow_in_flatpak/?utm_source=",

I have the game installed can play story mode just fine but when i try to go online it lets me get to the find session freeroam tab then starts loading the session, ends with error DR1001 and DR1002 anytime i try to connect. I have played nfs Heat online with no problems what so ever but anytime i try to play unbound i just get stuck with this issue non stop. Logs dont show anything to do with connectivity to the servers or anything. I am confused why i am having this issue but others were able to get it to work according to ProtonDB. If anyone has any kind of insight please let me know what I could do to fix this issue. If you need any more information let me know below.
