Physicists initially brushed this off with a plausible but boring explanation, but that reasoning has now been thrown out the window. So it\u2019s back to the drawing board, and we might be looking at new physics. Let\u2019s take a look at how this happened and what it means for physics.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.121003\n\nThis video comes with a quiz which you can take here:\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript wi",
