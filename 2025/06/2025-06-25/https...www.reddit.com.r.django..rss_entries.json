New system will then assign and show if the orders are ready, currently running, on-hold, awaiting artwork, and urgent. the system should also auto assign the tasks on the job page as per image below. Do we also need to add models for the job status in additin to the job tasks?</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h",
