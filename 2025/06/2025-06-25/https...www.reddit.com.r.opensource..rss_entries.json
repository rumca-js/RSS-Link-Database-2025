I&#39;m a computer science undergrad student in Brazil, and over the past year I\u2019ve really fallen in love with the world of Free and Open Source Software. I\u2019ve become a daily GNU/Linux user, and I\u2019ve been diving into tools, communities, and ideas that completely changed the way I see technology. More than just using FOSS tools, I\u2019ve realized that teaching others about them and contributing to open ecosystems is something I care deeply about.</p> <p>The problem is: my university doesn\u2019t have any kind of FOSS-focused initiative. Nothing about Linux, no open source projects, no install fests \u2014 not even talks about it. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to create a club from scratch. My goal is to bring together students who want to explore open source development, organize workshops and talks, contribute to projects during the semester, and most of all, spread the philosophy behind free software.
