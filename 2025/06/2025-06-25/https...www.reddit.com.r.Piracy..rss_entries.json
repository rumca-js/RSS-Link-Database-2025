I just got a smart TV and am using the browser on it to watch movies on a site my friends regularly use without fail. After a while the movie stops and the page freezes, but only after I clear the data I can watch the movie again. I\u2019m wondering if the internet provider is somehow blocking the site or maybe I\u2019m tripping. I\u2019ve heard people get letters from their internet providers if they watch free movies on some sites out there and that they\u2019ll take action against those people if they don\u2019t stop. I\u2019ve only heard people get these types of letters if they live in apartment complexes with everyone having the same internet provider. If this is the case, what can I do to keep watching free movies on my TV\u2019s browser? My Smart TV is a Google TV/Android TV by the TV brand Hisense if that helps.

Ok, nothing out of the ordinary, normally they falsely detect cracks. But when I open windows defender, it was referred to as a Trojan. I tried to quarantine it, but before I was able to do anything, the notification disappeared and the 2 executables disappeared as well. I deleted both the .rar and the folder, but I&#39;m pretty worried after that, since it was considered one of the goated sites here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KillYourOwnGod\"> /u/KillYourOwnGod </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ljuval/potential_virus_in_cracksurl/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ljuval/potential_virus_in_cracksurl/\">[comments]</a></span>",
