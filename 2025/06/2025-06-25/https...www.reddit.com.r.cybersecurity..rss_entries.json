My manager is interested in setting up a lab (utilizing Caldera and Atomic Red Team) to test EDR solution and perform detection engineering. </p> <p>Could I have some advice on the best practices of setting up a lab like this for a company? Should I host everything on Azure or keep them local on a VMware? Caldera has to run on a Linux server, so it seems like I have to create at least 3 VMs (Caldera server, Windows testing VM, and Linux testing VM). Does it sound right to you guys? Besides Caldera and Atomic Red Team, are there any other tools you guys recommend? </p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Moonsoo00\"> /u/Moonsoo00 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1lkgu1l/red_team_lab/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",

We&#39;ve hit a snag, and I&#39;m hoping someone here might have some insight. We&#39;re trying to share an encrypted PDF with an external user (who does not have an Office 365 account but does have a Live.com account). The problem is, when they try to open it in Adobe Acrobat, it just won&#39;t open. Here&#39;s the weird part: After clicking around and going through a few prompts, if the user navigates all the way to what seems like the very last step and then presses the back button, the document briefly appears! Is this expected behavior? Are we missing a crucial step for external sharing with AIP-encrypted PDFs, especially for users without an O365 account but with a Live.com one?

Was with a good large defense contractor, enjoyed my job but not the job security. Moved over to federal October of 2024, and well yeah, that ended quick with the current administration. I am currently at an old company that I worked for a while back working in their up and coming cyber group, but its more policy related than anything right now.</p> <p>This job is just a stop gap for me at the moment, not many advancement opportunities, and not the work/life balance that I am looking for (on call rotations, constant after hours work, 5 days in office). So I am looking on linkedin for openings, and my god the requirements have changed since I last looked.</p> <p>I have just over 4 YOE in cyber, mostly DoD related with most of my experience being vulnerability scanning and management, system hardening/patching, compliance and documentation updates, and a bit of system engine",
