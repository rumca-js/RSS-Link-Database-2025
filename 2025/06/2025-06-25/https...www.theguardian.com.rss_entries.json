In fact, Keir Starmer will have been thrilled with the timing. OK, he may have to swallow his pride and indulge in the by now obligatory Sunbed God idolatry to which every Nato leader has now signed up. But at least he didn\u2019t have to face the embarrassment of a 120-and-growing rebellion by his own backbenchers over the welfare bill. Weirdly, cutting benefits to people unable to wash themselves wasn\u2019t the reason why many Labour MPs went into politics.</p><p>So, for the second week running, Starmer\u2019s duties were transferred to the more than capable hands of Angela Rayner.

It\u2019s gritty and somewhat shocking, insofar as it\u2019s not a highly discussed topic in film, yet it is also very tender. I watched it on a rainy Saturday afternoon without knowing anything about it. I was immediately hooked by how normal Max\u2019s life was and intrigued by his decision to set up an online escort profile under the name of his alter ego, Sebastian, for the purpose of his novel, in which he details his varied sexual experiences. The film addresses issues such as shame, authenticity in fiction and consent with a refreshing lack of judgment on the topic of sex work. Ruaridh Mollica is fantastic as Max/Sebasti",

Rajan gradually realised that his mother, a practising Hindu, \u201cseemed to have an emotional toolkit that I lacked\u201d. Has this lack of faith made it harder to come to terms with bereavement? With this question in mind, he travels to India to take part in the Hindu festival Kumbh Mela. Initially, he\u2019s slightly overwhelmed by the intensity of the pilgrimage, not to mention emotionally triggered by seeing so many older Indian men who remind him of his dad. And he\u2019s soon faced with more tragedy, as a crush causes 30 deaths.
