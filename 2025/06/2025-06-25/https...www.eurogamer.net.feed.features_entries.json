It must be twenty feet tall, for one thing, and the pears are these fat golden gems that hang from its spongy boughs. The pear, I remember reading in The Observer about fifteen years ago, is a fruit whose time has come. Fifteen years means it's probably come and gone by now, but still: that pear tree of mine. Sometimes it's nice to get off the motorbike I use when gardening, put down my magic trowel and just take it in. I grew that!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-fortnite-has-a-clone-of-robloxs-grow-a-garden-but-how-many-clickers-can-one-human-realistically-play\">Read more</a></p>",
