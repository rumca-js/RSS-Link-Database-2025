In this video, I dive into the \u201cTelos File\u201d, a single markdown document that keeps everything about you. Then, we run it through a personal pentest; challenging your goals, values, identity, blindspots, and vulnerabilities. In this video I\u2019ll show you how to use it, and by the end, you\u2019ll know yourself better than you did before. I also sat down with Daniel Miessler, the creator of Telos, to break down the philosophy and power of this idea. One document. Seven minutes.
