I mean, dont u think this is kinda unfair and even hurts us? Like, we spend time and effort findin bugs, then they just throw it away for silly reasons. And even if they accept the bug, especially if it\u2019s critical or high severity, isnt there big chance they just take it and use it on other sites or systems to make way more money than what they paid us? Feels like they use us to do free work, then make profits on their own. Honestly, I\u2019m not convinced by this bug bounty thing, feels more like they exploit us. But maybe I\u2019m wrong, just wanna hear ur opinions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SingleBeautiful8666\"> /u/SingleBeautiful8666 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1lkfe5g/is_bug_bounty_really_fair_or_are_they_using_us",
