Here\u2019s a little browser trick I learned from an article we <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/439696/turn-any-browser-tab-into-a-basic-text-editor.html\">published back in 2014</a> that can help if you\u2019re just setting up your PC and don\u2019t have a word processor loaded on it yet, or if you just like to take notes and don\u2019t want to load up a program to do that in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I use it all the time to jot down notes as I browse the web and research stories for PCWorld. By putting all the useful facts and product images that I need to refer to in one place, I can cut down the number of webpages I have open at any one time. The information I need is also so much easier to retrieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-do\">What to do:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open your Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla ",
