        "description": "A fireside with Satya Nadella on June 17, 2025 at AI Startup School in San Francisco.\n\nSatya Nadella started at Microsoft in 1992 as an engineer. Three decades later, he\u2019s now Chairman & CEO, navigating the company through one of the most profound technological shifts yet: the rise of AI.\n\nIn this conversation, he shares how Microsoft is thinking about this moment\u2014 from the infrastructure needed to train frontier models, to the social permission required to use that compute. He draws parallels to the early PC and internet eras, breaks down what makes a great team, and reflects on what he\u2019d build if he were starting his career today.",
