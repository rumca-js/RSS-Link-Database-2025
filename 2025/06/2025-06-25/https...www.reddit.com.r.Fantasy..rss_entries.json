Set in an alternative, somewhat steampunk Victorian setting, 100 years after magic began leaking into the world, and maybe a decade after France was covered by a reverse-funnel sky and inundated with malevolent creatures, a toff\u2019s loyal servant and an artificial human (engineered, not mechanical) from another plane, race to prevent a cult from using the eldritch \u201cnotsonomicon\u201d to usher in the apocalypse and return lovecraftian horrors to power. </p> <p>Action packed, clever, and riddled with humor. Folks who enjoy Rivers of London, A Night In the Linesome October, humorous fantasy, and fantasy-horror, should all try a sample. It\u2019s currently on Kindle Unlimited. </p> <p>A quote: <strong>\u201cEven here in England all sorts of weirdness stalks the land.

Anyway, the crux of the thought was this:</p> <p>Time being linear, but not as a line; as a 4D plane-like a sheet. I think it side-steps the paradox problem and maintains cohesion well that way. It can be viewed as a timeline from a 2D perspective or a string from 3D, but it\u2019s actually a sheet. I\u2019m not sure if I can explain it well right now.

Alexandra Jennings from Akarnae going back in time to understand why the antagonist wants to kill every mortal and finding out that she was the inadvertent cause a thousand years ago in some sort of time paradox.</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
