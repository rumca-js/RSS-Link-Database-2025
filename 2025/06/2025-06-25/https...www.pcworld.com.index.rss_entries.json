Even compared to the 2.5-inch SSDs from a few years ago, it\u2019s practically immaterial. And the tiniest 2230-format drives, the kind that go in the Steam Deck and the lightest laptops, are even tinier. Today you can pick up <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D61Z8R1W\">a 1TB version from Crucial for just $85.73</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gen 4, 30mm-long drive isn\u2019t the biggest or the fastest on the market, but for portable gaming PCs and teeny-tiny laptops (at least the ones that actually let you access the SSD), it\u2019s more than fast enough with read speeds up to 7100MB/s. A screwdriver and a bit of elbow grease are all you need to install it, just make sure you have your files backed up. Amazon is selling this model for 36 percent off the retail price, so it\u2019s a great way to ex",
