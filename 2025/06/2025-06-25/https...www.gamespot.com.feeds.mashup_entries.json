The choice to transform the fantasy of playing football (soccer for the American folks!) from the traditionally tactical experience seen in most other football games into more of a high-action, mechanically complex throwdown with an emphasis on pulling off acrobatic plays and heroic saves is very cool. It's led to incredibly rewarding moments and crushing defeats, and riding the wave of those two extremes is a big reason why I enjoy games like <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/\">Rocket League</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/\">Apex Legends</a>.

There are a slew of mechanics that you have to learn if you want to survive out on the pitch, and some of those mechanics aren't even readily apparent through basic gameplay.</p><p>So, if you want to get past the learning curve of Rematch and start to become a better player, take a look at the guide below to see seven beginner tips that we've come up with during our initial playtime with the game.</p></h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Play with a controller (if possible)</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploa",

        "description": "<p>Samsung is offering a bunch of impressive price cuts ahead of Prime Day, with TVs, soundbars, and memory products all seeing significant discounts. The most enticing deals are for TVs, as you can save well over $2,000 on select products--making this an excellent time to upgrade your home theater. We\u2019ve noticed some of the deals are already selling out (The Frame QLED TV 50-Inch is no longer available in all regions), so we\u2019d recommend checking out all the offers while you can. Amazon is also price-matching some of the offers, so give it a look if you notice models out of stock at Samsung.</p><div title=\"6532682 - Samsung Early Prime Deals\" data-embed-type=\"buylink\" data-ref-id=\"3746\" data-template=\"4\" data-size=\"buylink__listicle\" data-title=\"6532682 - Samsung Early Prime Deals\" data-collection=\"\" class=\"norewrite\">  <div class=\"buylink-container\">                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">     ",

Read on for the details, and everything else new in the latest major update.</p><p>The new update includes some changes to photo evidence, as well as adding two brand-new types of evidence to collect--videos and audio recordings--with the latter attached to a new piece of equipment, the Sound Recorder.</p><p>Where previously players could take up to ten photos per investigation, they'll now be able to capture five photos and five videos, as well as three sound recordings. Some of the types of evidence photos that didn't make a lot of sense--such as flipped light switches and items that had been manipulated by a ghost--have now become video",
