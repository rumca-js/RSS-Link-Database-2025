For the sequel, writer/director Gerard Johnstone (working off a story from him and the first film&#39;s writer Akela Cooper), have taken a few notes from <em>Terminator 2. </em>This time around, there&#39;s an even more evil android on the scene (Amelia, played by Ivanna Sakhno) who wants AI to rule the world. And there&#39;s only one somewhat less evil android that can stop her: M3GAN.</p>\n<p>If that setup sounds silly and campy to you, well... it is. That&#39;s the point. More so than the first film, <em>M3GAN 2.0 </em>leans into the sheer silliness of its premise and is all the more fun for it. It&#39;s also not really a horror movie this time, it&#39;s a full-on action film with tons of gunplay, hand-to-hand combat and one wingsuit infiltration sequence that would be right at home in a <em>M",
