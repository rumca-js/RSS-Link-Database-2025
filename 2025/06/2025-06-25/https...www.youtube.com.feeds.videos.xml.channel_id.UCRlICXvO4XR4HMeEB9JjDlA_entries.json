        "description": "Caffeine is a familiar favourite in our hot drinks and is perhaps the world\u2019s most widely used psychoactive substance. By blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, which promote sleep and relaxation, caffeine is a neurotropic, or smart drug, in disguise. It\u2019s known to improve concentration and reaction times, enhance vigilance and elevate mood - but not all caffeine sources are created equally. In green tea, the effects of the caffeine are combined with an amino acid known as L-Theanine, to enhance its positive effects while dampening the less positive aspects. Fewer jitters and less risk of potential anxiety may make green tea the superior source for caffeine.",
