Even more concerning, the models aren\u2019t \u201cgeneralizable,\u201d meaning they might be just memorizing patterns instead of coming up with genuinely new solutions. Researchers at Salesforce, Anthropic and other AI labs have also raised red flags. The constraints on reasoning could have major implications for the AI trade, businesses spending billions on AI, and even the timeline to superhuman intelligence.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>llama.cpp is the original, high-performance framework that powers many popular local AI tools, including Ollama, local chatbots, and other on-device LLM solutions. By working directly with llama.cpp, you can minimize overhead, gain fine-grained control, and optimize performance for your specific hardware, making your local AI agents and applications faster and more configurable</p> <p>In this tutorial, I will guide you through building AI applications using llama.cpp, a powerful C/C++ library for running large language models (LLMs) efficiently. We will cover setting up a llama.cpp server, integrating it with Langchain, and building a ReAct agent capable of using tools like web search and a Python REPL.</p> <p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/building-ai-agent-with-llama-cpp\">https://www.kdnuggets.com/building-ai-agent-with-llama-cpp</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kingabzpro\"> /u/king",
