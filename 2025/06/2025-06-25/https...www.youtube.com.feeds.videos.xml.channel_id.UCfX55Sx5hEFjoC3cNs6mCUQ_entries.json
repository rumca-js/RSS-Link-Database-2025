        "description": "In this interview, Swapnil Bhartiya speaks with Yaron Schneider, Co-Creator of Dapr, about building resilient and autonomous AI agents on Kubernetes. Unlike many experimental frameworks, Dapr Agent extends the battle-tested Dapr workflows to ensure durability, fault tolerance, and seamless rehydration\u2014even across pod or cluster failures. Schneider shares insights into how developers are automating DevOps, customer support, and CI/CD workflows, while bridging CNCF-native tooling with AI workloads. Learn how Dapr Agent is paving the way for production-grade agentic systems.\n\nIn this interview, learn about:\nWhat makes Dapr unique in the CNCF ecosystem for application developers\nHow Dapr Agents provides durability and resilience that other AI frameworks lack\nReal-world use cases from DevOps automation to customer success\nThe pain points that led to Dapr Agents' creation\nCommunity feedback and future roadmap including Anthropic MCP integration\nPlans for C# and Java support beyond Python\nWh",
