Throughout we get little crumbs and moments, in non chronological order, as we get some idea of what happened (though tbf this is not a plot-centric novel at all).

I did find the translation by Basil Creighton a bit hard going, so I switched to the David Horrocks translation, which I think helped a fair bit. As this is a very philosophical book I would say it&#39;s a moderately difficult read, but I think overall it is worth reading for most people.</p> <p>The striking quality of Steppenwolf is how deeply personal it is, and you can get an immediate sense as soon as you start reading of what Hesse was struggling with at the time, which is not entirely surprising as the novel features a lot of specific elements of Hesse&#39;s life.

Their immediate neighbors have all boys and families and children grow up as close friends with a few incipient romances. WWI ends the idyll and about half the book follows their various adventures in the trenches , in the air, and in the hospitals.
