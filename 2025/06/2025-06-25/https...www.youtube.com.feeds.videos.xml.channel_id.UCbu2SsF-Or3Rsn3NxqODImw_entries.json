        "description": "The world of Death Stranding is vast, weird, and at times, can feel impenetrable. But if you, like me, read all the optional emails and interviews in the first game, and did as many deliveries as you could stomach, you too can piece together a chronological sequence of events that help make sense of Kojima Production\u2019s upcoming sequel. This is the complete Death Stranding timeline (spoilers, of course), and it starts with the Big Bang.\n\n00:53 - In The Beginning\n01:32 - Bridget Strand\n03:41 - The First Voidout\n04:42 - The Ungers\n06:00 - Sam\n07:11 - The Death Stranding\n09:01 - Lucy\n10:15 - Homo Demens\n12:11 - The Chiral Network\n18:00 - The Last Stranding\n\n#deathstranding #hideokojima #playstation",
