It needs to use a certain public IP, different from the docker host and other containers, when it downloads. To do this I connected it to a macvlan network (simply called macvlan), gave it a static IP, and set my router to NAT its internal IP to the correct public IP. This works great.</p> <p>The container also has a webUI for management. By default, it uses HTTP and I normally use Nginx Proxy Manager to secure and standardize these types of webUIs. My Docker host has a bridge (better_bridge) for containers to connect to each other; ie. NPM proxying to ATW&#39;s webUI.</p> <p>The issue I&#39;m running into is that when both of these networks are configured in Docker Compose, Docker automatically uses the bridge instead of the macvlan since it is alphabetically first. I know that with Docker CLI, I could start the container with the macvlan then connect th",

Mostly old research papers, some newer preprints, lots of multi-column layouts, embedded tables, formulas, footnotes, etc. The goal was to parse them into clean, readable Markdown for easier indexing/searching and downstream processing. Wanted to share how I set this up using Docker and some lessons learned.</p> <p>Tried a few tools along the way (including some paid APIs), but I recently came across a new open-source tool called OCRFlux, which looked interesting enough to try. It&#39;s pretty fresh - still early days - but it runs via a container and supports Markdown output natively, which was perfect for my needs.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what the stack looked like: - Dockerized OCRFlux (built a custom container from their GitHub repo) - A small script (Node.js) to: 1.

I&#39;m working on a cloud container platform and would love to get your thoughts and feedback on the concept. The objective is to make container deployment simpler while maximizing resource efficiency. My research shows that only 13% of provisioned cloud resources are actually utilized (I also used to work for AWS and can verify this number) so if we start packing containers together, we can get higher utilization. I&#39;m building a platform that will attempt to maintain ~80% node utilization, allowing for 20% burst capacity without moving any workloads around, and if the node does step into the high-pressure zone, we will move less-active pods to different nodes to continue allowing the very active nodes sufficient headroom to scale up.</p> <p>My primary starting factor was that I wanted to make edits to open source projects and deploy those edits to production without having to either self-host or use somethin",
