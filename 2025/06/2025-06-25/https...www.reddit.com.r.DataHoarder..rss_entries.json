        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Basically, I&#39;m a non-tech guy struggling to migrate from OneDrive to pCloud. I paid for RiceDrive, which sucks, by the way. I tried transferring in smaller chunks, but nothing worked; it took 18 hours to transfer 1 GB. I got a refund. Their support seems nice, but I need my data transferred, so I&#39;m seeking help. Someone could access my device via AnyDesk or TeamViewer to help me set up the rclone CLI tool on my VPS? I&#39;ve been struggling to set it up since migrating. I&#39;ve watched countless YouTube videos regarding rclone; I must be dumb, or it&#39;s not working due to a bug. Either way, I need help. I&#39;ve already tried web GUI apps like rcloneui and rclone-view, but none worked. Please, someone come and help me out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct_Law_3708\"> /u/Distinct_Law_3708 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ljzyr5/help_a_brothe",
