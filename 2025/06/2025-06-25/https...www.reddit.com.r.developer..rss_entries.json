As you already know, to do or weather apps are overdone.</p> <p>So I came up with this idea: Why not build a tool that scrapes live job postings from job boards, analyse the requirements, extract required skills and technologies, and then use AI to generate educational project idea based on that data. Also, add explanations on why the project is relevant and what value would it provide. </p> <p>I understand one motivational factor is that people need to be interested in order to start a project and finish it, thats why I was thinking to allow the user select their wanted role, interests (e.g. finance, health), skill level, and then incorporate this information into the project suggestions. </p> <p>I\u2019d love some feedback on this idea before I go deeper",
