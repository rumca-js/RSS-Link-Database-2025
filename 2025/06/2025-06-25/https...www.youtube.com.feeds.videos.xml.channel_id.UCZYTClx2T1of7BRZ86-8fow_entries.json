One of them, currently under construction, stretches across the Mediterranean from France to Greece. And despite being under construction, it's still managed to record an event that could rewrite the astrophysics textbooks.\n\nHosted by: Hank Green (he/him)\n\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: J.V.
