Think of it as The Great Gatsby meets Ocean&#39;s Eleven, 100+ years ago. A real page-turner, if you&#39;re in a reading slump I promise this will bring you out. The introduction alone mentions liquid nitroglycerin used for safe-cracking...a very exciting book that makes you root for the criminal. One of my favorite books of all time, and I&#39;ve read hundreds.</li> <li>Dead Wake by Erik Larson. Each chapter switches back and forth between the Lusitania and the U-boat that was stalking it. He&#39;s one of my favorite authors ever. He is so descriptive you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re on the ship deck watching the torpedo. He sparked my interest in U-bo",

It\u2019s almost like remembering a special holiday with family. The memory of these books, even small, specific passages and the time of year are just locked in my mind. A lot of the books are when I was much younger but I\u2019d like more significant reading memories as an adult.</p> <p>For example: </p> <p>Reading Rafe Martin\u2019s Rough-Face Girl - a picture book Cinderella retelling as a kid. I still recall finding this at my elementary school library and holding it in my hands while staring for a long time at the cover. If you\u2019ve never seen the cover, look it up.</p> <p>Ella Enchanted - I still remember specific passages and at one time had entire portions memorized because I reread it so often. The first time I read it, the excitement and disappointment as I reached the final page - and wishing it were longer.</p> <p>The Seer and the Sword by Victoria",

Maybe that&#39;s not the proper term, but I was always the kid checking out the big informational books on space, egyptology, history usually with some form of infographic or pictures to complement them. I grew up looking at my mom&#39;s world book encyclopedia collection. I could not stand reading chapter books, especially ones assigned and not chosen. I usually either skimmed the book or cliffnotes to concoct some sort of book report that was acceptable. I thought I just wasn&#39;t a book person. </p> <p>In my adulthood, I have acquired a library of personal development, self-help, sociological, etc books. I can breeze through these books with zero issues as long as I&#39;m interested in the topic. When it comes to fiction, I&#39;m chasing butterflies.

Often a lot of living visible history (old houses, old careers, old roots), the social dynamics which come with everyone knowing eachother, as well as an air of mysticism attached to being so close to the sea imo. I think magical realism, or elements of fantasy (and horror), fit so well in these places. Maybe it stems from fishermen/sailors life at sea always being connected with mysterious legends, mermaids, sirens, disappearances, giant ocean beasts, idk! And there always being family secrets, bad blood going back generations (in my experience, growing up in a place like this lol)</p> <p>I&#39;d love to read something which threads these things together.

I just turned 30 and started a new job (relationship management / banking) a few months ago. I\u2019m struggling with the transition since it\u2019s a new role and I\u2019m expected to take on a lot more responsibility and ownership than I have before. It\u2019s also a position, like many sales positions, where instant gratification is non-existent. It\u2019s challenged my confidence, outlook, and views of success. I\u2019ve often thought about giving up and it\u2019s caused me to take my foot off the gas at times. </p> <p>I tend to resonate with books that hit me exactly where I am in life where the message strikes a deep chord with me. Right now I\u2019m feeling a lot of doubt in my ability to be successful, but know it\u2019s in me deep down. </p> <p>I\u2019d be open to anything from non-fiction to fiction and anything else you all would recommend. </p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
