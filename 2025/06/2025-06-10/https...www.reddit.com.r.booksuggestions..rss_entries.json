That made me realize: there must be books out there that hit just as hard, and I\u2019m probably missing out because I haven\u2019t picked one up in ages.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m into: \u2022 Gritty, grounded sci-fi/fantasy or zombie-type stories \u2013 anything like TLOU, LOTR, or Andor vibes. \u2022 Period pieces or alt-history with strong narratives \u2013 think Red Dead Redemption 2 or Inglourious B",

Romance book marketed as fantasy, or B. The &quot;dark&quot; is just assault, and/or glorified abuse. Usually both. Which is why I want a book with neither.</p> <p>What I am looking for by &#39;dark&#39; is a story where it comes less from shock value but more from the world building, setting, and overall tone. A book that, as it goes on, things either start to feel more hopeless, or the characters go mad, kinda stuff.</p> <p>sorry if i am not being clear lol.

A particular favourite was the CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore. </p> <p>I wanted something with a similar feel aimed at adults but I\u2019ve found the Jack Reacher/Jason Bourne books to be unrelatable. Jack Reacher in particular is always the best at everything he does and knows more than anyone would have any right to about whatever subject comes up. I understand there will always be contrivances for a character to have the requisite knowledge to overcome a particular problem but in the case of Reacher it\u2019s too much too often in my opinion. </p> <p>In a video I saw on YouTube recently (MrSundayMovies\u2019 Caravan of Garbage: The Bourne Identity), the two hosts highlighted how in the film Bourne often doesn\u2019t do the exact right thing but follows a really clear logic in order to complete his objectives.

I personally love Rebecca Yarros and Sarah Maas so I loved that Devney Perry\u2019s writing was similar in this book. It worked great for my friends in my book club who love spice and writing but who prefer authors more like Colleen Hoover or Karen Marie Moning (specifically Darkfever). I recommended maybe crimson moth but my Karen moning lover has already downed that book series like a snickers bar. Any recommendations for this odd group would be helpful!

A book where the ML is head over heels and loved the FL deeply, he&#39;s funny and protective and just a great guy yk. Something more vanilla I guess. I recently read a Wattpad &quot;book&quot; called &quot;Tempting her teacher&quot;, and I love the dynamic of the ML and FL in that. The ML has religious guilt and moral guilt as he is engaged and attracted to his student. There&#39;s a lot of restraint and the ML is very pure and has such great intentions. But the author ruined the story about halfway in, made their first kiss shit but anyways I&#39;m looking for a similar dynamic. If you have any sugestions, please comment below!

I\u2019m making the clarification because im not looking for books that necessarily meet the romance structure, but are nonetheless romantic. I don\u2019t care about genders of anyone in the romance. I want books that have lots of yearning, heartbreak, people being terrible to each other and working through their shit. I really enjoy a book where the love interest is really fleshed out, but also, like, cool. Something where the attraction is more because they\u2019re really cool interesting people, not just that they\u2019re hot. A cast of characters side characters with their own shit would be great too. </p> <p>I prefer modern day settings, but i am also a fan of weirdo fantasy, horror, and high concept scifi stuff in modern day settings- this isn\u2019t necessary, but its definitely bonus points, especially if it\u2019s thematically linked with the romance/heartbreak/drama. </p> <p>Not YA, ideally mid 20s and up, though i\u2019m fine with sections/flashbacks to when they were ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So basically the title. But I&#39;m looking for something with some angst where the couple has to LEARN eachother. I want the guy to learn about the fmc&#39;s culture or &quot;black habits.&quot; I want misunderstandings that turn into heartfelt lessons. I want the black fmc to meet a man outside her race and be slightly skeptical or even new to her, even better if both fmc and mmc are stepping away from there usual dating pattern for the first time. And i definetly want the love scenes to be absolutely nasty! I also don&#39;t mind reverse harems. Please!
