        "description": "Elon Musk nukes his alliance with Trump by tweeting that Trump is \u201cin the Epstein files\u201d\u2014before quickly deleting the post. In this explosive episode, Russell explores the deeper meaning behind the Musk\u2013Trump split: the crisis in MAGA, the rise of tech feudalism, and the future of populism. With JD Vance defending Trump, Rogan stunned, and Twitter/X turning into a battleground of billionaires and burnouts, what does this rupture reveal about America\u2019s next political transformation? Is this just personal ego\u2014or the beginning of something much bigger?\n\nhttp://www.1775coffee.com/BRAND Get your 1775 Coffee starter kit worth $200 for only $99.
