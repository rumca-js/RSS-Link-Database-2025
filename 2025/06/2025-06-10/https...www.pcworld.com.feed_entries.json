Right now, you can get an \u201copen-box\u201d 49-inch ultrawide OLED from Samsung <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/365303079210\">for just $700 on eBay</a>. That\u2019s over $1,000 off the original retail price and $300 off the lowest price I can find for this model new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an open-box item being sold by an eBay seller, so I can see why that might be a deal-breaker. But the seller has good reviews and the purchase comes with a one-year Allstate warranty, which is a lot more than you usually get with a refurbished or open-box unit from any retailer. It\u2019s \u201ceBay certified\u201d for quality with a money back guarantee, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the G91SD version of the monitor, which isn\u2019t the latest, and though it has USB-C port",

They\u2019re a boon to both desktop and laptop users. While portable monitors might not reach the large screen sizes of conventional displays, they offer other advantages: They are relatively inexpensive, easy to connect, and, best of all, easy to transport \u2014 whether that\u2019s to a different city for work, or to a different room in your house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the widespread availability of these displays and the ability to manufacture them cheaply has resulted in some questionable brands on the market. Often the quality of these monitors can be sub-par. That\u2019s where we at PCWorld come in. We\u2019ve tested multiple models and can separate the best portable monitors from the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our list of favorites below will help you find the right portable monitor for you.
