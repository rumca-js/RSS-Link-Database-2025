At least in Mediamarkt stores, in Spain.</p> <p>They\u2019re demoing a more premium model (Quest 3), but only selling the cheaper version (3S) in store? Kind of strange. It seems misleading to let people try the Quest 3 and then offer them something else entirely. Not to mention, the performance and lenses are likely going to differ a lot.</p> <p>I had both 3 (before having a good PC) &amp; 3S, but you can clearly notice the lenses &quot;downgrade&quot; on 3s.</p> <p>Is this happening in other countries/stores?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DisastrousBid7306\"> /u/DisastrousBid7306 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1l7llc9/mediamarkt_in_spain_lets_you_try_the_quest_3_but/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.r",
