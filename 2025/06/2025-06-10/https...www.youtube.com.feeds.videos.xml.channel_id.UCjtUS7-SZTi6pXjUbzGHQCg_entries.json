Thorium reactors are like the solid-state batteries of nuclear power: vastly superior, yet forever on the horizon. But now, a Danish company is closer than ever to turning them into a reality. These aren\u2019t just thorium reactors \u2014 they\u2019re small modular reactors, designed to function as shipping container-sized, self-maintaining batteries that operate reliably for years. So, how is this company tackling such an ambitious engineering challenge? When might commercial thorium reactors finally arrive? And is thorium the missing piece in the clean energy puzzle?\n\nWatch How Waves Could Quietly Overtake Solar & Wind https://youtu.be/l1pxV7Nro34?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-thorium-is-about-to-change-the-world/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.un",
