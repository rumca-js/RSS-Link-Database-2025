The real threat posed by generative AI is not that it will eliminate work on a mass scale, rendering human labour obsolete. It is that, left unchecked, it will continue to transform work in ways that deepen precarity, intensify surveillance, and widen existing inequalities. Technological change is not an external force to which societies must simply adapt; it is a socially and politically mediated process. Legal frameworks, collective bargaining, public investment, and democratic regulation all play decisive roles in shaping how technologies are developed and deployed, and to what ends.</p> <p>The current trajectory of generative AI reflects the priorities of firms ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why is there such a divide on how soon or the impact of AI on the workforce. I read through this sub and other ones and it seems there are only two majority views on this topic. </p> <p>The first one is the thought that AI will have a major impact in 3ish years, half of the workforce will be replaced, new jobs will eventually be taken over by AI/AGI and they are praying we have UBI. </p> <p>The other view is people completely scoffing at the idea, comparing it to other advancements in the past, saying it will create more jobs and that everything will be fine.</p> <p>I just don&#39;t understand why there is such a divide on this topic. I personally think the workforce is going to be impacted majorily over the next 10 years due to AI/AGI and any new job created will eventually be replaced by AI/AGI. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Elevated412\"> /u/Elevated412 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.r",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been thinking about proposing replacing the search bars on some websites at my work with AI chat bots. My thinking is that conversational AI will give better (more usable) results and be easier for the users. The chat bot I intend to use will focus solely on information from a site map (or maps) I provide it. It will also provide the URLs for the sources it references. This would be like a search with that option.</p> <p>Has anyone seen anything like this done or considered it? What pros and cons do you see? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jccraig26\"> /u/Jccraig26 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l7l8mf/ai_chats_bot_versus_search_bar/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l7l8mf/ai_chats_bot_versus_search_bar/\">[comments]</a></span>",
