This melding of genres results in a game of two halves, weaved together with a rich and deep care for the source material. Funcom, somehow, has managed to juggle these components expertly. The result? A game unlike any I've really played before.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing\">Read more</a></p>",

These machines are hardware collaborations with Asus, bringing Xbox hardware design ideas to the table in combination with a revamped version of Windows that puts gaming first. There are profound, welcome changes here - but one big question needs to be addressed. Is this the first new Microsoft offering no backwards compatibility with the Xbox digital library? Is this an Xbox that doesn't play Xbox console games? If so, this is a bump in the road in Microsoft's journey forward - and must be addressed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xbox-ally-handhelds-microsof",

Stealth works the same (even the icon is identical), combat and dialogue feel familiar.
