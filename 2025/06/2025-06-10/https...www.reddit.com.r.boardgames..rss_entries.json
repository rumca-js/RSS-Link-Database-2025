They only had 2 packs left, so I said sure, I&#39;ll sleeve everything except the Advanced upgrades since I have some leftover sleeves from a previous game. Now, none of the stores that I can order from (for a reasonable price) have the sleeves, and said they won&#39;t be getting a restock. What&#39;s my next step? Is there a sleeve brand thats produces identical sleeves, or should I give up and just get a different brand and re-sleeve everything?<br/> Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Karlo760400\"> /u/Karlo760400 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1l7svmi/need_help_with_sleeves/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1l7svmi",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Buying a dining room table. I play a lot of board games, pokemon, dominoes, card games. Trying to decide shape. Gonna seat 8 no matter what, but I could get a rectangular table at 84x48, or a square at 54x54. I was thinking that the square would be easier for everyone to reach the center, but I&#39;m not sure. The rectangular one is a lot more sq footage, and good for long games like flamecraft... Any opinions?
