Under the right conditions, it can slash yields by up to 80%. The economic ripple effects? Massive.\n\nMeanwhile, some foreign institutions have been stockpiling grain and sending \"talent\" abroad through certain recruitment programs. The individuals involved? Tied to labs, funding sources, and affiliations that many would find\u2026 surprising.\n\nWe take a closer look at what happens when scientific collaboration meets national interest\u2014and when lab coats cover more than just research.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Subscribe for more investigations into global influence, research ethics, and what\u2019s really growing i",
