In my country, for example, 99% of all businesses are SMEs, making this a crucial topic for almost everyone here. Yet, too often, no one cares, or they only do when it&#39;s too late, and I speak from experience.</p> <p>I get it; the cost of quality security services isn&#39;t rock-bottom. In fact, if it is, that&#39;s probably a red flag. But it&#39;s not inaccessible for an SME, especially when you consider what&#39;s at stake.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m curious: <strong>Why do small/medium-sized companies often not invest in cybersecurity?</strong></p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this. What do you think are the biggest reasons",
