        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">2025 is looking to be a very interesting year for video games, as the current-gen PlayStation and Xbox systems are well into their lifespans while Nintendo is releasing the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/\">Nintendo Switch's successor</a>, the Switch 2.
