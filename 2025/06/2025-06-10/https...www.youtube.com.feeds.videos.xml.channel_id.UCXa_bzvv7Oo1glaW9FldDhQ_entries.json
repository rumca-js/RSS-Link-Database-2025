        "description": "The sequel to the PvP FPS mixing Halo freneticism with portals has arrived, and it\u2019s free to play right now. Graphical fidelity has been upgraded to Unreal Engine 5 and a new battle royale mode graces Splitgate 2, but not all for the better. \n\nAs discussed in the review, the aesthetics are more uninspired than the first game, and the stage design suffers just a bit from its more open-ended approach. Portal gameplay takes a bit of a backseat within battle royale due to limited charges and fewer walls to slap them on. That said, with three classes, new abilities, and a feature-rich stage creator, Splitgate 2 is sure to satisfy fans of the genre despite its shortcomings.",

        "description": "It's safe to say that we consider Silent Hill 2 Remake to be quite a frightening game, so when we say we think\u00a0Silent Hill f\u00a0at least has the potential to be a scarier game than\u00a0Silent Hill 2,\u00a0we're definitely not saying it lightly. \n\nThe next mainline game in Konami's resurgent horror series was first announced back in 2022 alongside other projects under the\u00a0Silent Hill\u00a0revival umbrella, but it wasn't until earlier this year that\u00a0Silent Hill f\u00a0was fully showcased with an in-engine trailer showing the setting, bits and pieces of gameplay footage, and more. \n\nThough there wasn't too much that was revealed, it was instantly apparent based on that early look that the game was taking interesting shape, and that its brand of horror in a period Japanese setting could certainly land with great impact with the right execution.",

        "description": "Going from an action-adventure title to a rogue-lite hack-and-slash may seem an odd pivot for Lost in Random, but The Eternal Die, developed by Stormteller Games under Thunderful, pivots well. Players control the former Queen of Random, Aleksandra, as she struggles to escape from the Black Die together with Fortune.\n\nEqual parts narratively charming and detached, Lost in Random: The Eternal Die feels earnest with its approach to the formula. Lost in Random: The Eternal Die offers an enjoyable rogue-lite experience with fun yet challenging combat, a great variety of enemies, extensive build-crafting, and tough bosses.",

If you have never played Breath of the Wild previously, and this will be the first time you do, then almost nothing in this review should matter or register for you. Ignore the nitpicking of a seasoned player who spent more than 400 hours on this game, and lose yourself in one of the finest adventures the medium has ever turned out. \n\nIf you are a returning fan, then it is great to finally have this upgraded version on hand \u2013 but given the fact that this is a paid upgrade, it is a bit disappointing that the updates included aren\u2019t more convincing.",
