I hope you are doing exceptionally well =) </p> <p>So I started a blog to explore the idea of using storytelling to make machine learning &amp; AI more accessible, more human and maybe even more fun. </p> <p>Storytelling is older than alphabets, data, or code. It&#39;s how we made sense of the world before science, and it&#39;s still how we pass down truth, emotion, and meaning.</p> <p>As someone who works in AI/ML, I\u2019ve often found that the best way to explain complex ideas; how algorithms learn, how predictions are made, how machines \u201cunderstand\u201d is through story. </p> <p>Not just metaphors, but actual narratives. </p> <p>My first post is about why storytelling still matters in the age of artificial intelligence. And how I plan to merge these two worlds in upcoming projects involving games, interactive fiction, and cognitive models. I will also be breaking down complex AI and ML concepts into simple, approachable stories, along the way, ma",
