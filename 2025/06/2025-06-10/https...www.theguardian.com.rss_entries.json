The Masters champion visited the venue just outside Pittsburgh at the start of last week on a scouting mission. On Tuesday, he gave a grisly definition of what unfolded.</p><p>\u201cLast Monday felt impossible,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI birdied the last two holes for 81. It felt pretty good, it didn\u2019t feel like I played that badly. It\u2019s much more benign right now than it was that Monday. They had the pins in dicey locations and greens were running at 15.5 [on the stimpmeter]. It was nearly impossible. This morning it was a little softer. The pins aren\u2019t going to be on 3 or 4% slopes all the time.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/10/rory-mcilroy-struggles-practice-oakmont-us-open-golf\">Continue reading...</a>",

But I\u2019m finding it surprisingly useful</p><p>At the start of the year, a friend asked artificial intelligence how to console his 10-year-old on the death of a pet. I thought this was the most ridiculous thing ever, given that ChatGPT didn\u2019t know the pet, or the 10-year-old. And surely the reason a pet\u2019s death occasions such unique grief is that pets are unique, and therefore cannot be imagined by a machine. So I assumed this wouldn\u2019t catch on \u2013 but then I have said that about every new invention, including but not limited to mobile phones, Google and Lime bikes.</p><p>Now everyone uses AI for everything, and I am slowly waking up to its appeal. Anthropic\u2019s Claude is apparently the more emotionally intelligent, but the beauty of it is that it\u2019s never so intelligent that it would tell you to grow up, get some backbone, and stop asking stupid questions.
