It can very easily feel preachy and more like reading a manifesto that tries to force values onto you, rather than challenge your perspective. Butler does not fall into that trap- not at all. Even though the main character&#39;s dad is a literal preacher, and the main character herself (Lauren) increasingly takes after her father and founds her own religion, Butler weaves the characters plot and ideas of her story so expertly that every aspect of it feels completely natural. </p> <p>Parable of the Sower is a story told in a epistolary format (qualifying it for HM in square 12 as well) about Lauren&#39;s experiences growing up and eventually leaving her community to reach for her own ideas for the future.

They are Paladin\u2019s Grace, Paladin\u2019s Strength, Paladin\u2019s Hope, and Paladin\u2019s Faith. They each focus on one of the seven paladins whose god (the Saint of Steel) suddenly and mysteriously died (before the events of the first book). Because the paladins were constantly in touch with their god, and controlled by the god in battle (as berserkers), this was a highly traumatic event. Most of the Saint\u2019s paladins died along with their god. The remaining seven are somewhat at loose ends. They have been taken in by the Order of the White Rat. The White Rat is a compassionate god, and the Order focuses on providing practical social services such as healing the poor and defending the accused in court. They have no need for warriors, but they do sometimes need to assign bodyguards, for example to escort a doctor to a dangerous part of town. Each volume has one of the",
