It presents some intriguing findings, around 40% of Nintendo DS/ Sony PSP users knew how to download pirated games, but only 5% actually did. The paper also found no strong negative correlation between piracy and videogame sales.</p> <p>That said, I&#39;m a bit skeptical about the methodology, particularly the reliance on self-reported data for illegal behavior. I understand the challenge of studying piracy, but I\u2019d be really interested in other studies that used <strong>different approaches</strong>, <strong>other platforms</strong>, or <strong>more recent data</strong>.</p> <p>Does anyone know of other academic papers, reports, or even well-sourced articles on <strong>videogame piracy and its economic or behavioral impact</strong>?</p> <p>Thanks in advance. I\u2019d love to dive deeper into this topic!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
