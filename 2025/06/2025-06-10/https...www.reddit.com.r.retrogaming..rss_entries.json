I honestly didn\u2019t expect to get so hooked on it but I found myself playing it for hours. Setting traps and planning stuff out instead of just straight up fighting feels really unique. Are there any other older games that have a similar vibe? Not necessarily just the Deception series, but anything with a focus on strategy, traps or kinda weird but fun mechanics like that</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kwiatek_Birtikuan\"> /u/Kwiatek_Birtikuan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l7mhcd/any_games_like_kagero_deception_2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l7mhcd/any_games_like_kagero_deception_2/\">[comments]</a></span>",
