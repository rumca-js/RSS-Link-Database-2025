        "description": "As the \"AI\" Tech craze continues at peak levels... many substantial startups are now being exposed as a complete fabrication. Instead of revolutionary technology, they rely on overseas, underpaid workers who impersonate chatbots and \"artificial intelligence\" systems in order to secure massive investor funding, only to come crashing down months or years later in spectacular fashion.\n\nEven industry leading companies like Microsoft, and Amazon are subjected to this problem, with an overall space that is now fully embracing the concept of useless, undeserved mania. \n\nWhile the overall concept of Artificial intelligence certainly carries risks, and significant innovation with it, the current industry norm is anything but valid. \n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE C",
