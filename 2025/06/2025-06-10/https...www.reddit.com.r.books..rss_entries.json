I enjoy stories that mix in philosophy and existential themes. I was told to expect all of this and more from many glowing reviews for this book. Instead what I got was 5 hours of unbearable drudgery which consists almost exclusively and entirely of the two main characters narrating snapshots of their lives while one is trapped in an apartment room and the other is trapped in a submarine. If that sounds like a compelling setting, don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not. There are maybe four main problems I have with this book. </p> <p>One is the length. Whatever it tried to do it could have easily done in half that length or less.
