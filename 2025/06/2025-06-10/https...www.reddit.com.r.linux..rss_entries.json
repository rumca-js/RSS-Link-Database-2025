It had bad perfomance, which was a problem witrh the nvidia drivers. After that I decided to try cosmic, but there, when I changed workspaces, my game just was minimized and I had to put it back into maximized state. Afterwards, I moved to gnome, but the game just refused to work properly. After all of that, I decided to copy my config for hyprland to the pc, added two enviroment variables from the wiki, and it worked flawlessly. I don&#39;t know, what was the issue with other DEs, but it was to hard to troubleshoot the issue.
