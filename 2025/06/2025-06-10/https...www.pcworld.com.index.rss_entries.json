The legacy storage format is still used in many air traffic control towers, in computers that still run on Windows 95.

They can be thinner and lighter than Intel- and AMD-based setups, and they last considerably longer on battery power. Yet while most of the Arm compatibility issues are solved either with native apps or good emulation, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2378322/qualcomm-adreno-x1-vs-intel-arc-real-world-performance-in-7-games.html\">gaming is still a very visible weakness</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might be going away soon, according to Chris Bergey, a senior VP of Arm Holdings.
