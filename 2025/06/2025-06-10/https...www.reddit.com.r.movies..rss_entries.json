It\u2019s visually stunning, historically rich, and clearly a grand and monumental achievement in filmmaking that took home all 9 Oscars that it was nominated for. The scope, the production values, and the sheer ambition behind it are undeniable. I absolutely appreciate every inch of its craft, but its soul never grabs my heart. It\u2019s the kind of film I respect more than revisit.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CinemaWilderfan\"> /u/CinemaWilderfan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l8cih4/what_is_a_movie_that_you_admire_more_than_you_love/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l8cih4/what_is_a_movie_that_you_admire_more_than_you_love/\">[comments]</a></span>",
