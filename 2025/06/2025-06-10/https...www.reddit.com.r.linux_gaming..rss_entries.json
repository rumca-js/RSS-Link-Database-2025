I have used this successfully with Fedora but I am wondering what the overhead will be if I did kicksecure debian or Secureblue OS. I want more security and want to install fail2ban, firejail/bubblewrap, AIDE, wazzuh, maldet, clamav, rootkit, crowdsec, cloudflare warp. I plan to encrypt the drive, yes I know this will be slow, windows 10 is working okay with this setup. I am curious which distro would you recommend. I know Secureblue has atomic images and yes I will need to layer the programs or perhaps use flatpaks. I also may want some gaming with wine direct 9 mmo like DDO or something which has run previously fine under Fedora. Am I asking too much for this laptop? Can I run kicksecure with VM and will it still be pretty secure? Any thoughts, yes I know I will be limited to opengl with Intel HD 3000 graphics card. Thanks in advance.

I am a newcomer to Linux, recent Windows transplant. After 25+ years of Windows I wanted to break out of the Microsoft ecosystem and try something new. I am a gamer and one of the challenges I have been facing is getting my games to run well.</p> <p>For this post I just want to focus on one issue. After approximately 1 hour of playtime, World of Warcraft Classic will begin experiencing frame stuttering. Relaunching the game client resolves it, but only for an hour. I come to you hat-in-hand to humbly request any assistance you can render. Thanks in advance!</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>System Details:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>OS:</strong> Fedora Workstation 42 with KDE Plasma Desktop</li> <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-14700F</li> <li><strong>GPU:<",

Currently I have a Gigabyte B550M mainboard, 2x Kingston 16GB 2400MHz DDR4, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X cpu (AM4) and RTX 3060 nvidia card.</p> <p>The motherboard at first seemed to be a good option, but the build quality is questionable. Onboard USB 3.2 socket broke with barely any force when inserting front USB extension cable. PCIe placement is also awful, graphics card obstructs other two sockets (the second long socket is only x4, not x16) and I had to use pcie extension cables for another ethernet card and a sound card.</p> <p>Recently my computer began to occasionally crash just a few minutes after a cold startup with no information in logs (no further crashing after reboot). At first I suspected my samsung nvme drive, replaced it with spare wd drive but the problems returned a month later. Sometimes the motherboard would beep with a graphics card problem code when trying to reboot. Drivers upgrade and Kernel upgrade did absolutely nothing. Memtes",

I can load up any game on steam, namely: Cyberpunk 2077, RDR2, BeamNG Drive, GTA5, FF7 remake just to name a few - They will work absolutely flawlessly, great FPS, no stuttering, for about 5 minutes. Then my entire PC will hard freeze, black screen, have to power it down and reboot. </p> <p>The weird thing is, I can load up furmark and ramp the GPU up to 100%, -while- loading up the CPU to 100%, and it will run all day without issue if I let it. I&#39;ve watched the temps as it crashes, and CPU/GPU both aren&#39;t overheating.</p> <p>I&#39;m running Fedora 42, but I distro hop a lot so I&#39;ve had this same issue happen on Manjaro, Rocky, Debian, PopOS, Ubuntu, KDE/Gnome/XFCE. Same behavior with open source drivers AND the AMD Pro driver. If anyone could point me in the right direction I&#39;d ",
