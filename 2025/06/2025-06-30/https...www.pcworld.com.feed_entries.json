(Try to buy a phone with a screen smaller than six inches, if you don\u2019t believe me.) Right now, you can get the biggest OLED monitor on the market for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Curved-QD-OLED-Monitor-PG49WCD/dp/B0CDFHY8TP/\">just $899 on Amazon</a>. And unlike some alternatives, this Asus monitor pairs great with gaming laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asus ROG Swift PG49WCD uses the same 49-inch 144Hz panel that Samsung, LG, and other gaming monitor makers do. Honestly, they\u2019re probably coming from the same factory. So it\u2019s up to individual manufacturers to distinguish their designs beyond that 5120\u00d71440 resolution, which is basically two QHD monitors squished together on one curved screen.
