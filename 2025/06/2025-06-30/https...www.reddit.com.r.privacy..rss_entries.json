Hopefully I&#39;m in the right place.</p> <p>I am an avid note-taker and I am looking for a place to collect them all in a logical and accessible way. I just graduated as an engineer where I used OneNote and so I have a very large amount of notes that I want to keep and possibly export somewhere else. I&#39;ve become very critical of Microsoft as time has passed and so I want to move away from OneNote. But all I have found are Markdown editors that are super frustrating to work with. I have tried Joplin and Obsidian but Joplin is very basic and Obsidian is quite possibly the most frustrating app I&#39;ve ever encountered. But maybe that&#39;s just me.</p> <p>Do you guys have any experience or input on a note-taking app that still allows for privacy and efficient workflow?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tibetan-sand-fox\"> /u/tibetan-sand-fox </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",

My biggest headache is with Facebook, which I\u2019ve had for over 10 years, since I was a child. I don\u2019t want to just delete my account quite yet, and I do want control over deletion as there\u2019s a few memories and such - I used FB\u2019s built in tool to make all my profile posts set to visible to me only, it\u2019s just things like comments and posts in groups that\u2019ll be a massive burden. </p> <p>So I need to try and find something that is compatible with Facebook, you have control and parameters over, and something that isn\u2019t going to get my account restricted or banned.
