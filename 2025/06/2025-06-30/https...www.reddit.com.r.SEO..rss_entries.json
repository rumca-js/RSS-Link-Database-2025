And framer is just too expensive for my needs, I don\u2019t need all that fancy bollocks and the form limit is the main thing stopping me. I bought a second domain which I host with framer. I recreated the home page with the idea I use that as my landing page for my Google Ads that just directs to my form page. For Wix the speed index is 4.3s and framer 1.2s. However as I\u2019m a Seo noob and I\u2019m slowly gaining backlinks to my main site and that\u2019s the one I want to rank ideally.
