From what I gather, this Neoh Yong Forex Course teaches his personal strategy while integrating an AI assistant that claims to help identify high-probability setups based on market structure and sentiment.</p> <p>Has anyone here actually taken the course or used the AI tool? I&#39;m curious whether it&#39;s just a gimmick or if the AI actually adds value beyond the usual indicators.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s natively supported by u-boot but I suspect its possible to bootstrap via a small SD card then boot from the SATA drive, much like using NVME a few years back before NVME was supported. This is a bit beyond my experience though - any help appreciated.</p> <p>I&#39;m running Ubuntu 24 on it right now, but I&#39;d imagine the process for booting from SD then transferring to SATA would be similar on Debian.</p> <p>Thx!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thaddeusharris\"> /u/thaddeusharris </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1lo3v4a/visionfive_2_boot_from_pcie_sata_card/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1lo3v4a/visionfive_2_boot_",
