He then went on to explain how current LLM prompt engineering feels like low level language for LLMs. He said that UI for LLMs is yet to be invented.</p> <p>Inspired by his talk, I sat down during the weekend and thought about it for a few hours. After some initial thoughts, I came to conclusion that If we were to invent the UI for LLMs, then:</p> <ol> <li>The UI would look different for different applications.</li> <li>The primary language for interaction would be English but more sophisticated. Means you would not have to go deep into the structure &amp; prompt engineering (similar to high level languages)</li> <li>The UI &amp; prompt should work in sync. And should be complementary to each other.</li> </ol> <p>With this thinking process, I decided to build a small prototype, VAKZero: a design to code",
