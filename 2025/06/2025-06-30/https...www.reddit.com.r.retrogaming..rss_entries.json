My dad downloaded it on a demo website with the Trackmania Demo around 2002 or 2003 when I was 8 years old on a Windows Millenium computer and I had the shortcut on the desktop to play it. It must be a demo too because I remember only 1 race. Classic racing, 3 laps and I think, 8 players in the race. The race had a aesthetic VERY similar to the Koopa Troopa Beach in Mario Kart 64, but the graphics looked better, like a early Gamecube/PS2 game.</p> <p>Seriously, I know a lot of video games and I never found this game in 20 years. No, it is not a dream. No, it is not one of these games but it looks a little bit similar. For some weird reasons I thought for a while the game name what Rocket Power, but it&#39;s just an unrelated kid TV show. - Beach Buggy Racing (came out way later in 2014) - Cocoto Kart Racer (came out way later in 2006) - Lego Rac",
