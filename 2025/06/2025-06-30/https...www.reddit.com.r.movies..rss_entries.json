Around mid 2000s I watched the first 15 minutes of a Korean film that opened with American women vacationing in Korea. Then the film cuts to a girl (probably high schooler/uni student) walking in the alley of what I assume to be Seoul. I believe she was wearing winter clothes and earmuffs. Then she greets what appears to be the owner of a restaurant and they seem close. Then a couple scenes later she greets them again but he&#39;s complaining about his hip due to it hurting. This is all I remember as I wasn&#39;t even 5 years old yet when I watched it. I think my parents told me to go away because this movie wasn&#39;t for kids and was a potentially a horror movie? But I&#39;m not 100% sure. We watched it in the garage so my guess is the movie came out early to mid 2000s. Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",
