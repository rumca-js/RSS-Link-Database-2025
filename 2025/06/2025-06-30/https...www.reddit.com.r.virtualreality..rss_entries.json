This means I want a headset that is independent and allows me to play VRChat without the need for a PC or laptop. </p> <p>So, I guess let me tell you a bit of extra detail. I will be playing in my bedroom, and there isn&#39;t tons of space, but there&#39;s a little 4x5 space in the center where I can do my little movements. I&#39;ve done a bit of checking out on the Quest 3 and 3S headset, and they seem nice, particularly the 3S, but the accessories seem mega expensive so I&#39;d also like to know if there are third party alternatives that are cheaper for accessories like head straps for co",

If the video was recorded as stereoscopic, you can use the VLC crop feature to hide one of the images. For example I have a 5400 x 2700 stereoscopic video clip. By default when playing I see 2 video images side by side. By using the Tools &gt; Effect &amp; filters. Then select the Video Effects tab. Then select the Crop tab. Then set the Left value to 2700, which works for the dimensions for this video. Done. Yay hopefully.</p> <p>If you are watching a 360 VR movie, it should work immediately, all you will need to do is drag the image around to your preferred view.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I asked this because some pc gamers are always think a game is terrible if they aren&#39;t getting 2 gajillon fps. I only recently got into pc gaming and I only ever care for it to be above 30 or so. I&#39;m historically a console gamer so this falls in line. I currently use a 3060 laptop and run many heavy games on 4k high and get like 35 to 40 fps and it looks and runs great to me. Some games I&#39;ll drop to 1440p if they can&#39;t handle 4k. I only really ever hit 60fps if playing on the laptop screen since it&#39;s only 1080p. But you best believe I&#39;m cranking most settings to ultra and sitting around 60fps.</p> <p>So my question is if this is the same when playing pcvr and uevr. I plan on getting a 4080 laptop and my only goal will be medium and 35 to 40 fps. If that fps is perfectly fine for me in flat, will I have the same opinion in vr?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SlowDragonfruit9",

With all headsets I&#39;ve ever used &quot;flat ground&quot; looking forward is actually like I am looking at a slight incline. like 5 to 10 degrees &quot;uphill&quot;. I have tested this by physically pointing at objects in the distance and then lifting the headset up, and I am always pointing up a few degrees at least. I also recently got open side facemask for my Quest 3, and I can literally just see that the horizon is angled upward in comparison to the real horizon</p> <p>If it was just the Quest 3, or just a specific game, I would think it was a setup or hardware issue, but every headset and every game I have tried over the last 3 or 4 years (which, admittedly is not many, but at least a handful) has this effect. It doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal, but it just makes things feel slightly less immersive/motion sickness-y. Like playing a racing sim, it is like I am always racing uphill, and it just doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot;",

Or even cause their gpu fans to keep spinning faster and faster until it fried. And im confused on how this all happens. Can someone explain to me what they mean spamming particles? I dont play any vr game, this just kinda confused me and wanted to know what they did. And why it could cause so much damage.
