        "description": "Jeff Goldblum is more than just an actor \u2014 he\u2019s a vibe, a mystery, a walking meme, and a cinematic icon. From his unsettling brilliance in The Fly to his blockbuster charm in Jurassic Park and Independence Day, to his recent roles in Asteroid City and Wicked, Goldblum somehow always plays himself \u2014 and yet never the same character twice.\n\nUnlike other actors who fall into typecasting, Goldblum has built an entire mystique around his cadence, charisma, and unmistakable weirdness. But how did this happen? Where does the actor end and the persona begin? \n\n#jurassicpark #wicked #independenceday #jurassicworldrebirth",
