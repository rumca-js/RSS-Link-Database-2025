A recommendation I received for running non-Steam games in Linux was to use Bottles. I think it&#39;s a neat concept to run Windows software, and I installed both the EA Launcher and Epic through a Bottle I made earlier today. However, despite the EA launcher working fine, the Epic Launcher seems to be rather slow, and gets stuck on &quot;preparing the epic games launcher&quot; screen for quite a while. Wanted to see if this was a normal issue others faced, since it&#39;s inconveniently long enough to make me want to post about it. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for answers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DjSikhNasty\"> /u/DjSikhNasty </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lolgwy/issues_with_epic_games_launcher_taking_forever_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",

I&#39;ve done a bit of research already, and have seen a couple of distros mentioned as good options for Linux gaming, but it feels a little daunting to try to narrow it down without any guidance. So I was hoping to get some opinions from the subreddit to see if there are any suggestions for a good gaming distro that could also cover all of my day to day needs (mostly web browsing and the occasional bit of photo editing). Also any gotchas to look out for in terms of hardware compatibility would be appreciated too. I&#39;ve built two of my own desktops in the past, but it&#39;s been 7+ years so I&#39;m a little rusty on modern specs, even though I&#39;m more than used to opening up a tower to work with the guts. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help you can give. </p> </di",

I am on fedora 42, i already installed the GPU drivers and changed windowing system from wayland to x11. For some reason, Baldur&#39;s Gate crashing on the loading screen, after i select continue. The menu is running as the same way as It was running on Windows 11 and i already made sure that Baldurs Gate is using my dedicated GPU.

After some bit of testing, the game finally loaded my save (It took like 5 restarts of the game), but i dont think the issue is solved.

I thought about it for a while and I decided to switch to Linux, for my main gaming platform, as I don&#39;t want to continue feeding the Megacorp that is Microsoft. </p> <p>That being said. I have never previously used any Linux distros. I did some research and while I understand that it&#39;s typically better to start with a Debian or Ubuntu based distro, I settled for Nobara instead. I was initially considering Garuda but I&#39;ve been discouraged by people I know from using an Arch based distro even though it&#39;s supposed to be more user friendly. I also considered Bazzite but I&#39;ve seen other people report that there are some issues with some games on Steam as it detects it as a SteamDeck.</p> <p>Anyway, just wanted to know, from the people who have experience using Nobara, what are common urdles that I should expect as a noob with that OS.</p",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, first of all sorry my English. My steam doesn\u2019t seem to be coroporating with my Linux. So i installed Kubuntu 47 to help speed up the proces. The problem is I was using wine as an emulator and it wasn\u2019t holding up. I put the files in the Proton folder and when I came back they were missing. I thought I could use Lutris in the meantime, but boy was i wrong because when I returened all my game files were corrupted. And steam wont offer me a refend. The package containing the files is corrupted aswelll, including the partition disc emulator. My GPU is thru the roof but I guess it\u2019s just not enough. Whenever I try to dowload videos, it says ERROR due to variablesssss. Not sure what this means but i restarted my Haljuico and I think i fucked it up more. I dug myself a deep deep hole of shit creating problems when trying to solve another. I need help. Someone do something. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
