        "description": "Layoffs aside, Microsoft has had a pretty solid year with video game releases. Despite blockbusters like Fable and Gears of War: E-Day launching next year, it's already delivered some big games. \n\nHowever, there have also been some notable misses and outright missing titles, particularly Bethesda Game Studios' Starfield. Touted as one of the biggest games of all time back in 2023, it would quickly slip into obscurity, even among some fans of the developer. Last year saw several updates and the horrendous Shattered Space expansion, but this year has been...quiet, aside from that minor update.\n\nWhat's going on? Where's the second expansion, or at least the announcement for it? When is Bethesda going to announce all the \"exciting things planned\" for 2025? That is the question.",
