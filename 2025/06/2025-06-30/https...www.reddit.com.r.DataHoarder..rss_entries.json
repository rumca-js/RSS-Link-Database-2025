Unfortunately, symlinks don\u2019t cut it, as they aren\u2019t seen as a media file, just a 0kb symlink.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard there are some convoluted workarounds to enable hardlinks in DrivePool by disabling load balancing, but for me that kind of defeats the purpose of creating a pool, I.e, easy rebalancing when I need to replace a drive so that snapraid is a last resort.</p> <p>TL;DR is there a good alternative to hardlinks that\u2019s possible within pooled storage without disabling load balancing? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cauli",

I kinda hate Snapchat as a message platform, but I digress (my family bullied me into using it)</p> <p>I realized recently we share a TON of family photos through this group that could potentially just disappear one day. Pics of ourselves, kids, pets, grandbaby, nearly every day. Someone in the group usually uses the option to &quot;save in chat&quot; so they don&#39;t drop off from history after a day, but that&#39;s just saving it in Snapchat&#39;s cloud so I don&#39;t have local copies of all these photos.</p> <p>Anyone else dealt with this? How do you make sure your saved Snapchat photos are safely preserved?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mortimer452\"> /u/Mortimer452 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1lnuxp",
