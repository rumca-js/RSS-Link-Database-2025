A recent update in Windows 11 Pro 24H2 introduced introduced security settings that block certain types of file sharing, specifically guest access. This can result in confusing error messages when trying to access shared folders. Fortunately, there are ways to work around this while staying safe on a private network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the message reads: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>You cannot access this shared folder because your organization\u2019s security policies block unauthenticated guest access.
