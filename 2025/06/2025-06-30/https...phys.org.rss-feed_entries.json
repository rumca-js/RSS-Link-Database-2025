        "description": "Baobab trees may be a proxy for measuring long-term use of land by humans. They live long, have economic benefits, and are used as shrines and markers on landscapes. Archaeologists have long suspected an association between baobabs and human settlements. Wolfgang Alders, who researches early urbanism and the first migrations by farmers to the Tanzanian coast, Jonathan Soon Lim, an archaeologist and remote sensing scientist and engineering Ph.D. candidate, and Logan Brunner used thousands of drone photos to connect the baobabs living today to ancient Swahili sites. Their findings suggest that the Unguja Island community's protection of baobabs today is rooted in stewardship that extended deep into the past.",

The Piscatorial Atlas, authored by Ole Theodor Olsen and published in 1883, contains 50 beautifully illustrated charts of the seas around Great Britain. These show the locations exploited at that time for a variety of fish species, alongside the typical vessels or fishing gear used. This information was collated from fishermen in the decade before the atlas was published.",
