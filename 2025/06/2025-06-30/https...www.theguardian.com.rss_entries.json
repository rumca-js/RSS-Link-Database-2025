The grated courgette melts into the pasta, and works perfectly with the lemon, trout and a hit of chilli. If you have one of those multi-nut and seed mixes (the M&amp;S 35-plant one is excellent), by all means add a scoop to finish; otherwise, a scattering of toasted pine nuts will add a welcome crunch.

Many of them are bioluminescent and can flash blue light; some will have patterns and do displays. These slender relatives of starfish can be very beautiful to look at and come in a range of colours \u2013 in the tropics, for example, they can be red, black or orange. And they\u2019ve got spines all over them, so they can look quite ornate.</p><p>They can also regenerate. Fish and other creatures will often nip off bits of their arms \u2013 known as sublethal predation \u2013 so they are constantly regenerating themselves. You can even break off all their arms, and sometimes even half the disc, and the brittle star will still regenerate.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/30/martin-solan-obsessed-with-brittle-stars-sea-floor-biodiversity-climate-cri",

It is home to Islam\u2019s first mosque, and the prophet Muhammad\u2019s final resting place. For anyone planning a visit, this documentary about the city\u2019s sacred sites is well worth a watch. Non-Muslims may find themselves reaching for their phones to look up terms and historical events.</p><p>There is an antiquated, mildly academic feel to the voiceover, like a BBC documentary from the 1970s. It begins with a brief overview of the prophet\u2019s migration from Mecca to Medina in 622AD, marking the start of the Islamic calendar. In the present day, the faces of pilgrims are a window into the significance of this spiritual journey for those with faith \u2013 but none are actually interviewed.</p> <a href",
