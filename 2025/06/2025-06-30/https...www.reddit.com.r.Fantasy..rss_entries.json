Yes there was frustration with the hobbit movies, but as a whole it was just a lot of lore discussion and questions and movie vs book comparisons and analysis. Recently however, it seems there&#39;s an obsession with denigrating other fantasy series/authors and constantly shielding Tolkien from any and all possible criticisms. I have very often seen people say that GRRM (I am NOT shielding him from some other criticisms btw) writes darker stuff because he never saw war, and borderline implying he was a draft dodger even though he was a conscientious objector to an absurd and idiotic conflict, and that he&#39;s just trying to tear down Tolkien&#39;s legacy even though he has repeatedly praised Tolkien many times. I&#39;ve even some people say there&#39;s just nothing else worth reading in the genre and just assuming Tolkien and Martin are it.</p> <p>LOTR will",
