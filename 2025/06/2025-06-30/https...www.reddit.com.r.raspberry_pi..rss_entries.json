I am pretty new to electronics in general so please excuse me if this issue is very simple.</p> <p>I have almost no clue as to what is causing this strange issue where the signal seems to be almost correct, but shifts and moves and glitches around. I believe the connections are not to blame as I have re-soldered them multiple times to ensure it is good. The chip is the ZT35GS10.</p> <p>It may be needing 6v -&gt; 5v modification as that is what wermy did in his tutorial,",
