It starts and it works and reaches speed of 2 MB/s and then it slowly goes down to absolutely nothing. Uploading is not an issue at all but it doesn\u2019t download anymore. I tried: - using a different VPN completely - reinstalled Flud - checked if I have enough space - checked if I have enough seeders (150+) - checked if I have internet - checked if my ports are ok - checked if I have the important settings on - checked if I have enough trackers and working</p> <p>I troubleshooted through ChatGPT and tried everything I threw at me but still nothing. Super frustrating and it worked before \u2026 can anyone help me? At this point it\u2019s more about the frustration of not finding the solution then just having the download \u2026 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBloodyAwful\"> /u/TheBloodyAwful </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",

A few months ago I installed a cracked version of Agisoft Metashape on my personal laptop to mess around with photogrammetry stuff (UAV data, mainly). It installed fine, ran fine, and I\u2019ve been using it on and off since without any obvious issues\u2014no weird CPU spikes, pop-ups, or anything sketchy.</p> <p>Yesterday I tried installing the exact same crack on a work PC (just for testing), and <em>that\u2019s</em> when Norton flagged a file in the crack folder\u2014<code>iphlpapi.dll</code>, tagged as <code>Win64:Evo-gen [Trj]</code>. I uploaded it to VirusTotal and saw that <strong>39 out of 71 antivirus engines</strong> flagged it as malicious. I noped out right there and didn\u2019t install it on the work computer.</p> <p>But now I\u2019m realizing:<br/> I\u2019ve been running this thing on my laptop for months, and that same file was obviously part of the install. I didn\u2019t even think to scan it back then. And now I\u2019m wondering how screwed I might be.</p",
