By systematically generating possible keys based on known parameters, an attacker can brute-force the correct encryption key without any elevated privileges or code execution. Once recovered, this key can decrypt any AppBound-protected cookies, completely undermining the isolation AppBound was intended to provide in enterprise environments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ES_CY\"> /u/ES_CY </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/c4-bomb-blowing-up-chromes-appbound-cookie-encryption\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1lod46a/breaking_chromes_appbound_cookie_encryption_key/\">[comments]</a></span>",
