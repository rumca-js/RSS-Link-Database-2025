It always makes me feel like I&#39;m forced to have multiple characters to kinda follow each others instead of really planning and spreading them around to deal with the disease. I hate this mechanic so much I was considering to sale my Pandemic if I ever coould find the other 2 games on sale, i would pick it. And today, both are available AND on sale in the same shop!</p> <p>So i was wondering if either Star wars or WoW had the kind of mechanics where you feel a bit forced to keep characters together to efficiently win? </p> <p>I enjoy both WoW and Star wars so the setting of both games would be great! </p> <p>Thanks for helping!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3",

At the end of the game, if people find a way to heal enough and remove enough clank, they can pretty muich walk around the board infinitely.

Black queens are worth 100 Jokers 50 Twos 25 Aces 15 Tens are worth 10 Every other card is worth five. Jokers and twos are considered &quot;wild&quot;. The goal is to create runs of numbers such as 3 4 5 in the same suite. Or three of a kinds which can be different suites. The wild cards can be used in place of one you are missing. King Queen Jack of the same suite is a run. You add up what you have on the table and subtract that from whats left in your hand when someone goes &quot;out&quot;. Every turn you discard at the end and either draw the entire discard pile or one from the top of the two decks. If you draw the discard you must play the top card. Thanks for any help.

Either officially by name (e.g. Dominion or Race for the Galaxy explicitly state &quot;Second/2nd Edition&quot; on their boxes), or by function (although this one, I&#39;d ask folks to provide some details as to why, vs it just being a reprint)</p> <p>Me, I&#39;m in the same boat as expansions... if it&#39;s good, then go with it. Here, these were meant to replace earlier editions. They usually fix stuff like better printings, materials, new manufacturers, rules streamlining, including extra content, and game play balance. Even &quot;the greats&quot; need to do this, like Catan, Carcassonne, Race for the Galaxy, Dominion, Pandemic, Agricola, where they got a lot more right the first time than not. In fact, it&#39;d be easier to list all the things they got wrong since that&#39;s not a lot!</p> <p>I like how Race got ",
