        "description": "Dr. Jordan Peterson offers a psychological and cultural analysis of the Grimm Brothers' Snow White, using it as a lens to explore evolutionary biology, female status hierarchies, fertility suppression, and the pathology of the \u201cevil queen\u201d archetype. Drawing on research in primatology and cultural commentary, Peterson connects ancient folklore to modern dynamics\u2014critiquing contemporary feminist ideologies, careerism, and generational envy, while upholding the redemptive power of masculine responsibility in narrative tradition (and real life). Part myth, part science, part cultural autopsy\u2014this is the synthesis of one of Peterson\u2019s most impactful tenants: stories matter, and fundamental stories reiterate across time.\n\nThis episode was filmed on June 24th, 2025.\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
