I\u2019m 26 and with my memory not being the greatest short term wise after a couple brain surgeries I\u2019m looking for books to read. Whether that\u2019s memory books (which I\u2019ve looked into online) or just a genre like fantasy. But willing to give both a shot. I\u2019ve read The Outsiders in high school and it\u2019s been my favorite book. I did start reading American psycho and it\u2019s alright but I just wasn\u2019t into it that much. I\u2019m also getting into the Bible more after being life flighted and my friend who helps at the church has read a lot of C.S Lewis\u2019 books says I might like them since he refers to the Bible in a lot of his books. I\u2019m open to any suggestions anyone has.

ACOTAR was mostly good, I think it was a bit too romance heavy for me. I really liked the world building and beginning of the very first book. I have tried a few times to read Crescent City and I just don\u2019t like it\u2014 I think it\u2019s the setting/more \u201cmodern\u201d quality to it.

I need some recommendations.</p> <p>Three days ago, I watched Kpop Demon Hunters and I really liked the relationship between Rumi and Jinu, so I&#39;m looking for a book with that kind of relationship.</p> <p>I&#39;m going to describe their dynamic (avoiding spoilers), in case you haven&#39;t watched it.</p> <p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s an enemies-to-lovers story, but I think at the beginning it starts with Rumi realizing that Jinu is a handsome guy but kind of rude. So it&#39;s one of those situations where you can&#39;t stand someone and you&#39;re like, &quot;Ugh, why are you even here?&quot;</p> <p>But there&#39;s a problem: Rumi is on the heroines&#39; side, and Jinu is on the villains&#39; side so they have to fight.</p> <p>Also, there&#39;s a moment where Jinu discovers Rumi&#39;s secret. Even though he could have exposed her, he keeps it to himself and even helps her hide it.</p> <p>Oh! There&#39;s also this thing where they help each other. Ji",
