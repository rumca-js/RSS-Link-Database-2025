As a beginner i decided to stick with Windows and use docker containers to run services. With help of some youtube videos I successfully set up Immich and Jellyfin (in the future I plan to also set up NextCloud, vaultwarden, joplin). For security of my ip address and ports i am using Taliscale. But as you know, it is better to self host on a machine running on linux. So with some spare time in coming weeks, i decided to make a switch, before I setup more services. I&#39;ll be installing linux mint, as it is beginner friendly. Do you have any advices on how to make this process as eficient and painless as possible? This includes tranfering images from Immcih and videos from Jellyfin.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Acrobatic-Salt3416\"> /u/Acrobatic-Salt3416 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

It\u2019s a personal project I built while preparing for the RHCE, mainly to get some hands-on Ansible practice, but I figured it might be useful to others in the community too.</p> <p>The idea is to patch and reboot nodes safely without affecting overall cluster availability. The playbook is designed around my own cluster setup (K3s with Longhorn, running across a few nodes), but I\u2019ve tried to keep it flexible enough to support other environments. For example, there are options to disable Longhorn checks, and it should work across common distros like Ubuntu, RHEL, and even macOS for control hosts.</p> <p>Key features:</p> <ul> <li>Safely drains one worker node at a time</li> <li>Applies updates and reboots without disrupting the cluster</li> <li>Optional control plane node updates</li> <li>Dry-run support to test everything before",
