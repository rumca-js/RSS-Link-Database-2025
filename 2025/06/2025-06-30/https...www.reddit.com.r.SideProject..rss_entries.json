It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time, not for monetization but just to try to build something meaningful to explore my interests.</p> <p>So far, I\u2019ve been posting one thread per day (some longer, some shorter), and trying to leave ~3 comments per day on other posts. I designed a rather minimalistic profile: the avatar is a double Fermat spiral and the banner features a sinc function, simple but symbolic of what I want the account to be.</p> <p>I try to write opening tweets that hook readers without being overly clickbaity. I\u2019d love to eventually post in a more personal and niche voice, but I\u2019m still trying to grow an audience.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where I\u2019d love your advice: \u2013 Is one solid thread per day a reasonable strategy to grow? \u2013 Do the 3-5 daily posts people suggest include threads or just single tweets? \u2013 Are 5\u20138",

As a surfer, I\u2019ve always noticed photographers capturing incredible moments on the beach, but there was no easy way to find or buy those photos. Surf Snaps solves that. Photographers can upload their shots, set their own prices, and earn 80% of every sale. For surfers, it\u2019s a simple way to find and purchase high-quality photos of their best rides. My goal is to create a win-win marketplace where photographers can turn their passion into income, and surfers can preserve their epic moments forever.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SurfSnaps\"> /u/SurfSnaps </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://surf-snaps.com\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lo6svq/building_a_surf_photography_marketplace/\">[comments]</a></span>",

You can branch your database like code, reset instantly, and start with anonymized production data instead of empty tables.</p> <p>The key thing is it uses ZFS snapshots, so branching is literally instant. No more waiting for data imports or running migrations. Perfect for when you need to test different scenarios or work on features without affecting your main dev database.</p> <p>It&#39;s BYOC (bring your own cloud) so you keep full control of your data. I&#39;m launching soon and looking for early users to test it out.</p> <p>If this sounds useful for your workflow, I&#39;d love to have you join the waitlist at stagdb.com.
