That alone sounds wild.

Like:</p> <p>Is this actually real?</p> <p>Is Valve going after Meta and Apple with this?</p> <p>Do we know when it\u2019s launching?</p> <p>And is this actually something worth waiting for?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been debating whether to get a Quest 3, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should just hold off.
