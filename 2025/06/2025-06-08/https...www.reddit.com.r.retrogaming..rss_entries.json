My goal is to create a custom emulator device housed inside a Game Boy or Game Boy Color shell that can play GB and GBC ROMs.</p> <p>I want to source individual components, doing the soldering myself, and assembling everything rather than buying a pre-made kit. I\u2019m aiming for something that feels like a modern Game Boy with a rechargeable battery, functional buttons, and ideally a nice screen, all powered by something like a Raspberry Pi Zero or similar board.</p> <p>If anyone has done this and has any tutorials, parts lists, build logs, or anything similar I would love to hear about it.

The controls take a bit to get used to and it would be nice if looking up and down was not reversed but honestly for my favorite franchise and the very first game that made me a huge fan of the series I&#39;m genuinely having a great time so far. I might actually get back into the series since it&#39;s been quite a long time. And I think it&#39;s time I finally read the legendary editions of the manga including Twilight Princess which is my personal favorite game of the series, after I replay the game itself on the GameCube, of course lol.

I don&#39;t remember them ever saying no to buying something back it was just a matter of how little they would give you. So where did all of these games end up? Did they end up being sold off to other countries in bulk? I&#39;d like to think Gamestop has an Indiana Jones type warehouse full of crates of games but they must not.</p> <p>Gamestop announced maybe last year that some of their stores would start selling retro stuff, I haven&#39;t seen it at my local store.

This Boulder Dash trilogy was created a while ago but has only been beaten by a few players so far. The whole trilogy can be found on lemon64 and as a download on itch.io. You can play it with the Commodore64 or the GDash clone.</p> <p><a href=\"https://captainpollutiontv.itch.io/boulderdash-ux-trilogy\">https://captainpollutiontv.itch.io/boulderdash-ux-trilogy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Captain-Pollution\"> /u/Captain-Pollution </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.lemon64.com/game/boulder-dash-ux-trilogy-vol-3\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1l688uu/boulder_dash_ux_3_large_cave_packs_for_advanced/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Even when I went to the local penny arcade and arcade bars (which are all the rage these days), they are some kind of variant of a 1up or MAME machine inside and so it is emulated. Even at a local retro trade show I attended last year, I was disappointed to find out that all the cabinets they had were emulated.</p> <p>Does it matter? Have you played on a real arcade machine, or do you know of a place where you can still play on those? Are they too old now and are they no longer functional and are retired? Can you tell the difference between the way an emulated machine plays vs the genuine thing?</p> <p>Unfortunately I never got into arcade games before they all got emulated, so I have no point of reference. To me therefore, MAME seems fine, but I know some people claim that the response time is not as good as the real thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
