The spacefaring RPG sequel will release on October 29, 2025.</p><p>The Outer Worlds was a satirical look at corporate culture through the lens of futuristic outer space corporations, and it looks like The Outer Worlds 2 will be no different. We knew from the start it would be getting a big debut at this year's presentation, as Microsoft has already announced a The Outer Worlds 2 Direct presentation following the broader games showcase.</p><p>The second one looks to be bigger in scope than the first. You play as an Earth Directorate agent, trying to uncover the source of rifts across Arcadia, while also running into a burgeoning rebellion against the Protectorate. This will be the second RPG from Obsidian just this year, after having released Avowed in February.

It's true that Konami's landmark original is as good a starting point as any, and Bloober Team's earlier works were often met with mixed reviews at best--<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/\">the team hasn't shied away from its history</a>. To me, it was nonetheless a tall task to live up to a game that so many hold so dear. But if you count yourself among those who are waiting to see if the Polish team can do it again, and with something entirely of its own creation, Cronos: The New Dawn is starting to look like that game.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in October of last year, Bloober Team told me that it's probably always going to be a studio that makes horror games, ",

This showcase has been running for several years now, and it typically offers a broad look at games--big and small--for PC and console. This year's show was hosted by Laura Bailey and Matthew Mercer, and some of the big titles included Supermassive's Directive 8020, Blumhouse's Crisol: Theater of Idols, and a developer presentation for Mafia: The Old Country.</p><p>There were also several world premieres here, as games like Reach showed off energetic parkour action, The Bureau of Fantastical and Arcane Affairs looks like a dream game for fans of arcane admin, and The Expanse fans can get excited for an action-packed exploration of that sci-fi series.</",
