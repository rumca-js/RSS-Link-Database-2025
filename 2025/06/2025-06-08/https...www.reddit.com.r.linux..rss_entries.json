Their environment was full windows devices and mentioned that I run a windows vm through qemu with a gpu passed through. Through the rest of the interview they kept questioning how comfortable I am with windows.</p> <p>My background is 5 years of edu based environments and 1 year while working at an msp as tier 1 help desk.

But since he doesn&#39;t have the time for that I&#39;ll want something similar to the MacOS or Windows that he&#39;s already used too.</p> <p>He mostly uses his laptop for browsing, and apps like pages to make documents from time to time, so the switch shouldn&#39;t be that drastic. The only thing he wants is for his apps and security to be up to date.</p> <p>I was thinking of going with the classic linux mint xfce for perfomance or maybe something like zorinOS, but i wonder if you guys have any good distros that are lightweight, and easy to use.</p> <p>Edit: I think most people misunderstood something.
