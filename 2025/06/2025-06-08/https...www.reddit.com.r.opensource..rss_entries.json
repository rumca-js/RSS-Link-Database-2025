As quantum technologies grow, interacting with them can be complex, so I wanted to create something that simplifies common tasks like quantum job submission, circuit creation, testing, and more all through a simple command-line interface.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what <strong>QShift</strong> currently offers:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Quantum Job Submission</strong>: Submit quantum jobs (e.g., GroverSearch) to simulators or real quantum devices like IBM Q, AWS Braket, and Azure Quantum.</li> <li><strong>Circuit Creation &amp; Manipulation</strong>: Easily create and modify quantum circuits by adding qubits and gates.</li> <li><strong>Interactive Testing</strong>: Test quantum circuits on simulators (like Aer) and view the results.</li> <li><strong>Cloud Execution</strong>:",
