I\u2019ve been slowly moving away from Google over the past year and wanted some advice on some particular services where I am struggling -</p> <ol> <li><p>Mail - I actively use 2 personal gmail accounts, 6 work accounts from multiple companies (all from Google workspace, I&#39;m a consultant so each company has given me an email ID. Don&#39;t have a lot of say here). I recently have setup an email on a custom domain on fastmail and gave it out to people I know but I realised I actually don&#39;t use my personal email for much except logins and billing. The problem is that my personal account has logins for everything. Bulk of my emails are for work and for that i have work email IDs. The only saving grace is that I don&#39;t ever open gmail and I do not have the gmail app because I use Superhuman email client for my personal and work email IDs. My question here is 2 fold - first, do I transfer all my logins and billing and such from my personal gma",
