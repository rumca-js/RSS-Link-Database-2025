The only difference was how they found relevant code. Tasks ranged from find",

I\u2019m the founder of a bootstrapped SaaS company built over the last few years, focused on dropshipping automation and I\u2019m in <strong>survival mode</strong> right now.</p> <p>Since the beginning, I\u2019ve worked with a small offshore dev team. They were organized and generally reliable, but communication was always indirect. I\u2019ve never actually spoken with the developers directly. Everything went through project managers. This quickly became a game of telephone, where important details got lost along the way. Small bugs would eventually turn into much bigger problems. Feature launches were slow and often unstable. And as a non-technical founder, I lacked the context to challenge things early on. I assumed this was just how software teams worked.</p> <p>Even then, I started to notice a recurring pattern: we were cleaning spills, not patching holes. The same bugs and breakages kept resurfacing.",
