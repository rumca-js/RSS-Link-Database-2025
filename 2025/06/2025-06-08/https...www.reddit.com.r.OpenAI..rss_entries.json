However, the current version of Open AI only lets you use voice mode with the screen unlocked, which is not really compatible with this kind of thing.</p> <p>Grok works great, however, making it easy to turn on voice mode, lock your phone, and put it in your pocket and have a discussion about any topic you like using AirPods. Yesterday I was asking for details about different kinds of ketogenic diets and why they work, getting detailed information while standing inside a crowded train.</p> <p>Tl;dr OpenAI needs workout give me a 35 minute timer to make voice mode work with a locked phone quickly, or people who want this feature will become attached to Grok.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/peterinjapan\"> /u/peterinjapan <",

But I\u2019m not sure the outlook is as dire as it seems. Reasoning as we understand it maps more to what cognitive science calls System 2, slow, reflective, and goal-directed. What LLMs like GPT-4o excel at is fast, fluent, probabilistic output, very System 1.</p> <p>Here\u2019s my question:<br/> What if instead of trying to get a single model to do both, we build an architecture where a frozen LLM (System 1) acts as the reactive, instinctual layer, and then we pair it with a separate, flexible, adaptive System 2 that monitors, critiques, and guides it?</p> <p>Importantly, this wouldn\u2019t just be another neural network bolted on. System 2 would need to be inherently adaptable, using architectures designed for generalization and self-modification, like Kasparov-Arnold Networks (KANs), or other models with built-in plasticity.
