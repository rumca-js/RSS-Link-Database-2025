Long story short I found out that SAS drives exist and they don&#39;t fit SATA docks. Unfortunately, I bought it online and though I plan to contact the seller to see if I can return it, that might not be guaranteed. In the meantime I was wondering if I could get some help seeing if there was an economical way to use the drive on my Windows 10 PC. I&#39;ve seen some adapters that look to just be male to female put my Youtube search indicates that they might not work. Apparently, I might need a controller or something.

Initially, my thought was to toss it all and just download em. But then went down a rabbit hole.....</p> <p>- A bit of research indicated that those Blu-Ray rips online aren&#39;t as good quality as what I can do with a dedicated DVD ripper and Make MKV. So I am looking to get the ASUS BW-16D1X-U, which is an external DVD drive for ripping purposes.</p> <p>- After ripping my Blu-Ray, I am contemplating how and where to store these discs/cases/artwork. Ideally, it would be in the garage. So I am thinking putting all these in a Pelican case with desiccant packs. Would that suffice for long-term storage in a non-climate controlled garage? If it matters, I live in NYC.</p> <p>Any thoughts and/or suggestions welcome, including maybe just ripping em and then tossing it lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ming-",
