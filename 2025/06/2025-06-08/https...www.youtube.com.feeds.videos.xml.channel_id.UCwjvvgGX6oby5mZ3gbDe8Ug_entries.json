        "description": "#exam #college #school\nWelcome to a high school in Hengshui, China\u2014where students run instead of walk, memorize textbooks while waiting for food, and live by the second, all for one test.\n\nThis is not just any school. It\u2019s known as the \u201cultimate exam factory,\u201d producing top scorers for China\u2019s college entrance exam, the Gaokao. But at what cost?\n\nFrom military-style routines to 20-minute lunch breaks, this system pushes students to their physical and emotional limits. Some thrive. Others break.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes race shaped by intense pressure, inequality between provinces, and an unforgiving social ladder.\n\n\ud83c\udf93 In 2025, over 13 million students are taking the Gaokao. Only a fraction will make it into elite universities. The rest? Their futures hang in the balance.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what it takes to survive China\u2019s most brutal high school.",
