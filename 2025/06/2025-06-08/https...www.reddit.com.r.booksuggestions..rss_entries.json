It was exciting and fun. I\u2019m also a sucker for the National Treasure movies with the whole \u201chunting\u201d and \u201cpuzzle\u201d and \u201clost/legend\u201d aspect of them. Mysteries and histories and legends coming true. It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s not based in reality, but I do like imagining a world where the things that happened in those stories is true. To think life is a little more extraordinary and exciting.</p> <p>I\u2019m only in my 20s now but reading has been really hard for me for several years and I\u2019m hoping to find a book that I cannot put down. I miss when my fingers itched to pick a book back up so I could keep the story going. </p> <p>Anyone have any recommendations for anything like this? I\u2019m not entirely sure if what I\u2019m looking for has name for this kind of genre or storytelling. I\u2019ll take good mysteries and whodunnits too!</p> <p>Cheers!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

The genre really doesn&#39;t matter, I like all genres as long as they are somewhat grounded in realism. The main things that I hoping to find are a romantic side plot that developed over the course of the book and a group of characters that stay together for the whole plot.

I&#39;m craving suspense and mystery, but offset with humor and friendship. I want a character who may be faced with grizzly murder, but then goes home to a supportive partner, or who has close friendships with co-workers.</p> <p>On TV, I would point to shows like Castle, White Collar, later seasons of Bones, or even Criminal Minds, which can get very dark, but also has that &quot;we&#39;re family and we have each other&#39;s backs&quot; vibe.</p> <p>I enjoyed Iain Pears&#39; Johnathan Argyle series. Preston &amp; Child&#39;s Pentaghast books almost scratch the itch, but I don&#39;t really like some of the characters. A grown-up version of John Bellairs",

I also really enjoyed the political intrigue and how seamlessly it tied into the romance. The side characters, like the Bomb and the others who were with Jude, were amazing too. I adored how the romance felt secondary to the main story, yet it was never absent for too long.

I wanted to get into reading more actual books (i&#39;m an current AO3/former wattpad user) but the only things I&#39;ve read are fanfiction (obviously), warrior cats, and some romance manga. The mangas i&#39;ve read have been short stories, Parasyte, and Love is an Illusion. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking into fantasy books as I&#39;m a DND player and things like dragons, and other worlds/universes interest me. Anyone have any ideas on what or were I could start out at?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bread_txt\"> /u/bread_txt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l62wqv/place_to_start/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1l62wqv/place_to_start/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve asked ChatGPT and googled similar books but I can\u2019t find anything that grabs me. Can I get some recommendations that are similar to the CoMC? Not even the storyline necessarily, but the pace, or the overall atmosphere of the book. Everything about it made me love it and consider it one of my favorites. Please help out if you can! I\u2019m trying my hardest to get back into literature and CoMC made it easy until I\u2019ve hit this roadblock.
