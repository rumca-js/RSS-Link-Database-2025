But i cant play my games with my current setup : i am using an old but strong GTX 1080 TI OC which I have had for years and which has an annoying tendency to freeze the whole computer after 10 minutes of playing any games (on windows or any OS). This is easily solved on windows using Nivdia control panel debug mode (which sets clocks to factory presets, and solves the conflicts with the drivers or whatever) and I can play for hours without any problems. I CANNOT enable debug mode on linux. It seems i have to edit a xorg.conf file which does not exist on my distro. The nvidia xconfig does not have the option, unlike on windows. Am I stuck until I change to an AMD Gpu ???</p> <p>FYI I did not overclock the card it came like this out of the box, and using debug mode i have been gaming for 5 years without any issue.</p> <p>Thanks for your help !!</p> <",

Unfortunately, I have had no luck in getting it to run properly on linux, the issue being an invisible cursor. The game runs, I skip the 2 logos and 1 cutscene by pressing <code>esc</code> 3 times, and from that point, even if I load a campaign I will have no visible cursor.</p> <p>There are several ways to run the game: <code>native</code>, <code>steam linux runtime</code> and <code>proton</code>. The <code>native</code> and <code>steam linux runtime</code> types do not even start the game for me (segfault or generic errors) so I am sticking with proton.</p> <p>Things I&#39;ve tried:</p> <ul> <li>Changing resolution.</li> <li>Switching from full screen to windowed mode.</li> <li>Fiddling with in-game settings UI Scaling and UI resolution.</li> <li>Enabling or disabling in-game setting <code>Lock cursor to window</code>.</li> <li>Mov",

And when I mean ultrabook, I mean as small as I can find. I was looking in the 13&quot;-14&quot; range, and was coming up empty for the longest time. My requirements were: SMALL, Discrete GPU, Linux Support (Official or Unofficial)</p> <p>I thought I had a winner with the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 tablet, but it had a hardware defect with the charging port, so I had to unload it. Acer had a pearl white smaller notebook which came close, but I learned quickly that installing Linux on an Acer likes to break its BIOS. Suffice to say, it was a disaster. I was about to give up and relegate myself to steam-deck performance and having to bring along peripherals.
