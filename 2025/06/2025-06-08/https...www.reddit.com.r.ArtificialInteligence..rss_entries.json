Still, conversational agents remain limited in biology as they cannot yet fully comprehend biological sequences. Meanwhile, high-performance foundation models for biological sequences have been built through self-supervision over sequencing data, but these need to be fine-tuned for each specific application, preventing generalization between tasks. In addition, these models are not conversational, which limits their utility to users with coding capabilities. Here we propose to bridge the gap between biology foundation m",

The AI also predicts &quot;normal&quot; everyday violent crimes that the government isn&#39;t interested in, so Jim Caviezel and Ben from Lost team up to save the ordinary people. My question is: can we actually train AI to be so expert in behavior analysis that its able to predict violent crimes before it happens? Obviously this would mean feeding it all our data.

Housing has become very unaffordable in general (we have thought about moving to a lower cost of living area but are waiting to see when the fallout begins).</p> <p>With the jobs issue, it\u2019s going to be chaotic. Job losses will happen slowly, in waves, and unevenly. The current administration already doesn\u2019t care about jobs or non-elite members of the public so it\u2019s pretty much obvious there will be a lot of pain and chaos. UBI will likely only be implemented after a period of upheaval and pain, if at all. Once humans aren\u2019t needed for most",
