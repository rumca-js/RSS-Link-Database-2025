        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The Graduate is often mistaken for being deeply ambiguous, but this opinion came from Mike Nichols\u2019 decision not to yell \u201ccut\u201d at the end of the final scene, allowing the characters to fade silent and stare at the camera to show uncertain expressions. This tonal shift feels profound, but it\u2019s more of an aesthetic flourish than a true narrative or thematic ambiguity. The story itself is quite clear: Benjamin rebels against a future he doesn\u2019t want, chases Elaine, and gets what he wants, and they laugh happily at each other when they board the bus. They look into the camera because they are looking into their future.</p> <p>On the other hand, Rear Window is more genuinely ambiguous. While the murder is solved, the film raises unresolved ethical questions about voyeurism and whether Jeff&#39;s decisions are ethical or not. Was he a hero for stepping in and helping others solve a problem or was he stepping into peoples&#39; boundaries?</p> </div><!-- SC_O",

It seems many film writers strive to kill off supporting characters that are not integral to the plot. But that also means it is easy to spot the characters that have plot armor. I am always pleasantly surprised when characters survive in a film that I did not expect. Kudos to these writers, and I hope to create a type of list. Spoilers obviously.</p> <p>First some examples. </p> <p>The Star Wars trilogy- As a kid I thought Boba Fett was the coolest, but I loved the Xwing fights so I got attached to the pilot named Wedge. I was pleased when he survived.</p> <p>Aliens- Great storytelling. Did anyone on first view expect Hicks and Bishop to survive? Hicks doesn\u2019t have any prominent screen time in the beginning. As the film went on, I got more attached to Hicks, Hudson and Vasquez and was happy when at least one of them survived. </p> <p>Stargate- some interchangeable grunts surv",

It&#39;s about a couple or a family I think who go on vacation to a tropical place where they meet another couple who they start hanging out with. It turns out though that the other couple are murderers or criminals or something. That&#39;s all I can remember about the plot. The scene I remember is at the end of the movie where the girlfriend of the killer is on a helicopter (I think) with a sniper (probably police or some other kind of law enforcement) and he&#39;s asking her who to shoot because there were multiple people in the place he was aiming at. In the end she decides to give up her husband or boyfriend and says something like &quot;The man who has ruined my life is the guy doing (fill in the blank).&quot; I&#39;d appreciate any help since I really wanna see that movie again.</p>",

They\u2019re also considerably long, clocking in at 3 minutes sometimes. Now I know this isn\u2019t something new. Trailers giving away too much go way back. I mean decades. Films where I figured the director would have more control over their publicity, but they that don\u2019t.</p> <p>I remember some trailers that did it right, though. The \u201cjigsaw puzzle pieces\u201d trailer for David Fincher\u2019s The Game. Stanley Kibrick\u2019s \u201csingle piano note\u201d Eyes Wide Shut trailer. Alex Proyas\u2019 Dark City may be one of the most bonkers trailer I\u2019d ever seen. Less is more. Always.
