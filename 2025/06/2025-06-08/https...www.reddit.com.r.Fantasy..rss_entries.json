Kuang. It&#39;s not only the obvious things - the water dragon, firebird, Alina&#39;s sun summoning powers vs Rin&#39;s fire powers, the whole relationship between Alina and Mal vs Rin and Kitay, Grisha vs Cike, but so many more similarities. It&#39;s getting to the point where I can almost predict what will happen in the book based on what I&#39;ve already read in the Poppy War trilogy.</p> <p>I&#39;m starting to think R.F.Kuang was heavily inspired by Leigh Bardugo&#39;s work, given that the latter was published earlier. </p> <p>Anyone else who read those books see the similarities or is it just me? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iamirinap\"> /u/iamirinap </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1",

Often these are Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. And in a large amount of the books/shows/other media I&#39;ve read they&#39;ve had combinations of these base 4. Some had the same ideas for each combo, going off of what you would get if you mixed them irl. But others went more conceptually, so i went through and put down each that I could remember and some that I made up.</p> <p>In the end my question is, does anyone have anything to add to the list of combos below?</p> <p>Fire-Air -Whispy smoke (smoke carried and spread) -Hotter blue fire (fire empowered by air) -Heat -Light -Explosion -Lightning/Plasma</p> <p>Fire-Earth -Metal (refined earth) -Bigger fire (fire fueled by earth) -Thick smoke (impure smoke, heavy with impurities) -Ceramic (cooked/baked earth) -Magma -Glass</p> <p>Water-Earth -Mud -Overgro",
