Their 3D inserts looked weirdly familiar to ones I have seen online and when looking into it further, I found that this shop has downloaded the free STL files on websites such as Cults3D and Makerworld and were selling it for their own profits. To confirm that this was not given special permission from the creator, I have asked one of the creators who were copied from if they had any knowledge of this and as I predicted, no they do not. They then explained how their files in sites like Makerworld are only legally protected under specific conditions such as more than 2,000 prints in the original version or 500 prints on the infringing version. With board games inserts being a niche industry, it is very difficult to get numbers that high so that the platform would even bother stepping in",

We&#39;ve now started to wonder about ways of keeping solo mode fresh until an official expansion is released as the only real variance between each run comes from the market cards and the order of the Lord Ruler&#39;s deck.</p> <p>Has anyone experimented with any kind of alternative rules when playing against the Lord Ruler. Note that we&#39;re not looking to just make things easier or harder. Once you get a feel for the game and iron out the small details in the rules you might not catch at first, defeating him becomes a manageable challenge that&#39;s always satisfying to pull off.</p> <p>We&#39;re more looking for something fresh to change things up in future runs. The most obvious options are creating new cards to add into the deck and creating a new boos card altogether with a different set of Dominance effects,",

None of us know it, but there one buying it got it recommend at the game store. The only Feld game I&#39;ve tried is Bruges (which I liked) and the others haven&#39;t played any of his games. The most &quot;complicated&quot; games we play in this group are Terraforming Mars, Wingspan/Wyrmspan, Agricola and Scythe. In other genres we enjoy Destinies, Dead of Winter, Chronicles of crime etc.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried watching YouTube videos to judge if it&#39;s a game we&#39;d enjoy, but the reviews seem very mixed. Do you guys have any experience with this game - if so, what do you think of it?

Players use custom slammers to win key moments during gameplay, and the rest is strategy, area control, and champion powers.</p> <p>It\u2019s a weird mix, but it works surprisingly well and feels both nostalgic and fresh. I grew up on pogs, Magic, and tabletop games, and this project is something that&#39;s been in the works for a while now. It\u2019s being made by a small team of artists and designers, and we\u2019re using Kickstarter to help cover production costs for the first print run.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into slammers, collectible-style components, or anything nostalgic and physical in your board games, take a look.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the link to the Kickstarter if you want to check it out:<br/> <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magicdragonusa/p",
