So I installed clipious on the firestick and it seemed to work however all of my videos are only available at 360p making them unwatchable. I have dash set on my server and it seems to work fine, but if I enable it on the clipious client then the videos don\u2019t play, I just get a black screen.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions of alternative tv or firestick invidious clients that I can try? I thought I previously read somewhere that there was a jellyfin plugin however I think I must have imagined this as couldn\u2019t find one anywhere. </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scriminyjickets\"> /u/scriminyjickets </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l6a",

I have had a Synology, but I am slowly trying to just use the Synology for storage and keep the computing power on the Proxmox server that I built. The Synology currently has my *arr stack and a few bobs and bits and I want to keep the file structure that I have on the Synology for things I want to add to the Proxmox such as /volume1/data/media/ect and /volume1/docker/appdata (this is how things are set up on the synology for my docker containers)</p> <p>Here is where I am running into some confusion/problems.</p> <p>I figured out how to map Proxmox to Synology but I am using the mappings above, and I&#39;m not sure how to do that. Right now, I have shares on the Proxmox to the Synology being /volume1/proxmox (for backing up my LXC), and then I made one to /volume1/data but 1. The proxmox thinks there is WAY more storage on the Synoloygy than there is becasue it&#39;s reading volume 1 twic",
