        "description": "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nNintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a charming concept, mixing an interactive instruction manual with minigames and tech demos that show off the Switch 2\u2019s coolest features in a hands-on way. The execution of that idea, however, is a somewhat muddled collection of quaint distractions and missed opportunities dressed up as a completionist checklist without much point. This digital showroom is littered with dry informational slideshows that only occasionally feel like they are actually allowed to share something interesting. And while the minigames can be briefly amusing, it was almost never in a way that made me excited to push my high scores or check every single box. Tie that up in a world that\u2019s cute to look at but obnoxious to progress through, and you\u2019ve got a Switch 2 showcase that I certainly had fun with at times, but left me wishing I had just been exploring my new console with an actual game instead.
