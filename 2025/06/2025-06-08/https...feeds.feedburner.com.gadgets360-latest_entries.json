Investigations will explore muscle cell health, seed germination, algae growth, and the survival of tardigrades in space. They will also study astronaut interactions with electronic displays. These microgravity experiments could help enhance astronaut health, enable fresh food production in orbit, and inform better touchscreen tech. The research supports future long-duration space travel and may even offer insights for improving muscle and nutrition treatments on Earth.",

        "description": "Sharks were long thought to be silent, but a surprising new study reveals that rig sharks can make clicking sounds when handled. Evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder first discovered the clicks by accident during lab tests. These sounds\u2014likely produced by snapping their flat teeth\u2014occurred most often during initial handling, suggesting a stress or defense response. If confirmed in the wild, this could change how scientists understand shark communication. The study opens new questions about the acoustic capabilities and behavioral complexity of these ancient marine predators.",
