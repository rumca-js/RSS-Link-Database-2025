The chances of your product going viral there are slim. Sure, there are alternatives - but most of them are just clones of Product Hunt. Nothing against their UI/UX, it\u2019s actually decent. Other thing is, most users on Product Hunt (and it&#39;s alternatives) are developers or early adopters.</p> <p>You don\u2019t really go there to find a tool to solve a specific problem. The search system just isn\u2019t made for that.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s TAAFT (There\u2019s An AI For That). It solves that exact issue, it&#39;s built for finding specific tools for specific tasks. And unlike Product Hunt, most of its users aren\u2019t developers. But here\u2019s the catch: it only accepts AI-related products. If your product isn\u2019t clearly AI-focused, you\u2019re out.

It helps companies assign clear responsibility for each subscription, sends regular check-in emails, and triggers renewal reminders. There\u2019s also basic reporting to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.</p> <p>This is still very early, but I\u2019d really appreciate any feedback you might have. Does it make sense?

The project actually got some traffic. At the end of its runtime, it counted for over 1500 unique visits per day and got great SEO results in Google search.</p> <p>Then came the policy changes and I eventually decided to discontinue the project. Because you never know how long you can have access to the API. </p> <p>But it was a wild ride. On one day it got even over 100K unique visits after I posted it on a sub around in 2022. That was crazy, seeing so many users on my site. They were so much, that the server of the live project instance even was temporarly unavailable. </p> <p>Now I decided to open-source the project, so if anyone wants some inspiration from the project or want to build upon it, feel free to do so. It&#39;s developed using PHP as backend programming language and uses mariadb as database storage.</p> <p>Here is the project GitHub",
