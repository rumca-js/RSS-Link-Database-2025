And they asked a question, the rule aren&#39;t that clear in the French version so I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ve always played it like it is forbidden to lie. But one of my friend read the rule and there a sentence that could lead to let you think you could lie. Translated in English (French version sorry) that&#39;s the rule:&quot;About honesty: Cryptid gives you free rein to mislead your opponents, while depending completely on the honesty of the players... &quot; For those who have the game how do you interpret this section of the rules? Can player actually lie when they place their token?</p> <p>EDIT: Thanks you all, i always play with game without lying and my friends misinterpreted the rule and i though for a second i might have misinterpreted as well.</p> <p>But you&#39;re right the game fall apart if you lie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

It looks like a good game to have friendly match / tournement in the week-end while not beeing to heavy (beer friendly). And the thematic is really cool, I think we would love to choose a hero each and trashtalk the other heroes all day long.</p> <p>It looks like you can play 1v1, in teams or in free-for-all and it looks fun with strategy and dices.</p> <p>Do you think it could be a good choice? Would you have another suggestion for me? </p> <p>Thanks in advance and I wanted to say that this subreddit community is insane, so much help, passion and fun, I love you all! </p> <p>Have a great day everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_O",

He picks up a good card from the pile, decides to keep it and discard his existing card number 2 (which he did not know what it was). When he opens up card 2 to discard it, he realises it matches his card number 1. He then claims to discard two matching cards.</p> <p>My objection to this move is that he did not KNOW that his card 1 and card 2 were matching, he did not announce that he was discarding two matching cards , and he is pulling this off on the fly. It feels like he is getting an extra move by playing this way.</p> <p>What are your thoughts on if this move should be allowed? (Th",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! I\u2019m in a inner fight with myself about what board game buy. I have to say that I usually have a group to play but this doesnt happen so much, so seeing that JME is more a huge campaign that requires its compromise to play its a hard decision, but it doesnt bother me to play alone, most of my board games I played it on solo. The issue comes with IA which I love that the game comes with two modes so that add some replayability but like I said I dont often have a group to play. I think this game could be more enjoyable with more people. I know about the app, but i have my doubts.</p> <p>What are the pros and con on each game? Which one is adaptable to playing solo and which one offers more replayability?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/snachtj23\"> /u/snachtj23 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lcf5mc/imperial_assault_or_lotr_journeys_in_middle_earth/",
