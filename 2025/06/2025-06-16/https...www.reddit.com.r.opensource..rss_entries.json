Basically, it uses a few line traces to check if the player is about to walk off a ledge, and if so, it stops them from moving forward. Jumping between ledges still works by default (which is easy to change if needed!).</p> <p>This is a bit different from the bCanWalkOffLedges in GetCharacterMovement(), as it doesn\u2019t stop the player right at the very edge of the capsule. Instead, it prevents forward movement just in time, which prevents the player from floating at the ledge.</p> <p>Features:</p> <ul> <li>Lightweight &amp; fast</li> <li>Easy to tweak in the header file</li> <li>No plugins or setup needed</li> <li>Well-commented and easy to drop into your project</li> <li>Great for platformers, action games, or anything where you want to prevent falls</l",

I\u2019m Michael from Verso Industries, and I\u2019m thrilled to share <strong>HighNoon LLM</strong>, an open-source large language model we\u2019re building under Apache 2.0. It\u2019s designed to process language like we do\u2014hierarchically, efficiently, and privately on your own hardware. We\u2019re inviting the community to check out our GitHub repo, contribute, or share feedback to help shape this project! Here\u2019s a peek: <a href=\"https://github.com/versoindustries/HighNoonLLM\">https://github.com/versoindustries/HighNoonLLM</a>.</p> <h1>What\u2019s HighNoon LLM About?</h1> <p>HighNoon uses a unique <strong>Hierarchical Spatial Neural Memory (HSMN)</strong> system to break text into 128-token chunks, process them into a binary memory tree, and understand both fine details and big ideas. Think of it like reading a book: you group sentences into themes, not memorize every word. This makes it great for summarizing long docs, writing code",
