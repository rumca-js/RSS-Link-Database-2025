Thousands of people died in the initial attack, and several more in the immediate area died from smoke inhalation later. Muslims became Public Enemy #1. It began our decades long conflict with the Middle East. However, one of the biggest impacts of 9/11 locally was how the government reacted to it. There have been several new laws put in place to ensure another 9/11 doesn&#39;t happen. Some people believe that these laws came at the expense of our freedoms. However, because we were still effected by the attack, forced Patriotism became normalized. This was the time of Freedom Fries. If you didn&#39;t support this, you were a tree hugging liberal who wanted the terrorists to win. After all, if you had nothing to hide, what were you scared of?</p> <p>Why am I talking about 9/11? Well, Little Brother&#39;s primary story is a social commentary on the post-9/11 hysteria and the Patriot Act. It was also published i",

Although this post is about problems I had with the book, I liked it a lot - I wouldn&#39;t care enough to complain if I didn&#39;t like the book. </p> <p>Dragon Teeth is a historical fiction western about a rich, sheltered man who travels to the western frontier after a childish bet in 1876. He hops onto an academic expedition with a famous paleontologist to fulfill his bet. He soon finds out that the paleontologist is in a bitter rivalry, and the paranoia of the professor leads to many issues for him - but they end up being the least of his worries. Our protagonist contends with Indians, swindlers, gun fighters, and more. I definitely recommend the book to anyone who likes westerns or Crichton. It&#39;s a really easy read. Stop reading now if you may want to read it one day - spoilers follow.</p> <p>I had a few issues (or maybe I just didn&#39;t understand) with some plot points in the book. </p> <ol> <li>",

The book had a surreal cover depicting what looked like mannequins in the desert and a great, wide eyed face looking on in pain. But what really caught my eye was the name on the spine: Frank Herbert. I love Dune, and all the sequel Frank wrote, even if they do get more bizarre and more explicit in his fetishes as they go.
