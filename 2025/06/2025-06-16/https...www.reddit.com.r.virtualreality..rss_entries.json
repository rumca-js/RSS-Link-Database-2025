I got the CV1 in 2017, and I still use it 8 years later. I considered upgrading to the Quest 2, but was turned off after trying it for myself. The headset movement felt less crisp, and the hand movement had a minuscule amount of lag (probably unnoticeable to newer VR users). It also felt like a waste of money because I already have the processing power in my PC (rtx 3070) in addition to a hefty SteamVR catalogue that would feel jankier with the Link cable (plus expensive). The Meta account stuff (from what I hear) is pretty brutal too and, although not a big deal, I do love the passion project feel that the CV1 had as opposed to the corporate Meta b.s. </p> <p>The Quest 3S is running for $270 at Walmart, which seems extremely good on paper. Given that I already have the PC processing power, a Rift CV1 that I love, and a substantial SteamVR library, is it worth upgradin",

Slowly over the past 6 months I&#39;ve been having issues where the quest app on PC has just been freezing and failing entirely from the app locking up and not being able to be shutdown unless I go through task manager then will get stuck and pretty much have to restart PC, issue continues after fresh install of Windows. Due to it being caused by app issues I want to avoid meta at all cost any recommendations?

I have a decent funding for a new headset (\u00a3550) so I was hoping you could recommend me options in case anyone here has experience with this use case? I was thinking I would use something like Unity or Unreal Engine to build what I need, but is there a better software for my use case? In short, I would need to import a model of the brain and its vasculature as a 3D mesh of some sort, then make the blood vessels interactable through either touch or clicking on it and add visual effects to them on interaction. I am brand new to VR so any help would be appreciated.
