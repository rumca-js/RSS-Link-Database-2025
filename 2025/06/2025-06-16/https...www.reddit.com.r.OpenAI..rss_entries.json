Making it longer costs more tokens. So, when a user interacts for the first time, GPT gets the system prompt plus the input and gives a response, then when the user interacts for the second time, GPT gets the system prompt plus input 1 plus its own answer plus input 2. </p> <p>Obviously, making the system prompt long is expensive. </p> <p>My question is: what can OpenAI do to instruct models besides the system prompt, if any? In other words: is ChatGPT built by OpenAI in the same way we would build a conversational bot using the API? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Grindmaster_Flash\"> /u/Grindmaster_Flash </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lczek9/how_does_openai_instruct_models/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Open",

Once released, these models are essentially frozen. Fine-tuning them for specific tasks is challenging, and adapting them in real-time can be computationally expensive and risks overwriting or corrupting previously acquired knowledge. Currently, no widely available models continuously evolve or personalize in real-time through direct user interaction or learning from examples.
