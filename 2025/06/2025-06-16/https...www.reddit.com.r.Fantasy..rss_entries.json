I am not the biggest anime fan outside enjoying Studio Ghibli, and a few others. I am sometimes hesitant to try out animes because some can be seemingly never ending or maybe a little too weird for me. However, we started watching this anime, and I am hooked! The art style is simply beautiful, and I would say it is overall a cozy story about an elf finding the meaning of friendship, love, and humanity. There are battles, though.</p> <p>For the fantasy element, it has an elf main character, a dwarf, classic DnD archetypes, mages, and demons.</p> <p>I think this would appeal to other Studio Ghilbi fans for the artwork, and fans of DnD adventure stories, and anyone who wants something hopeful and cozy.</p> <p>Also, does anyone else have any great fantasy animes they&#39;d like to recommend? One of the ones I loved was Little Witch Academia. I liked the magic school and f",

I grew up on Tolkien, Feist, Jordan, Rothfuss, and Erikson\u2014epic, immersive series that shaped how I understand the genre.

Romance-Fantasy clearly resonates with a lot of readers, and that\u2019s awesome. More people reading fantasy in any form is a win.

(Warning, it definitely has all the downsides to barbarian fantasy: overdramatic violence, all women/men are sexy as hell, machismo cranked to 1000, etc\u2026) But you just have to go in expecting that.

Lately, I\u2019ve been feeling that the kind of fantasy it represents is becoming increasingly rare, or at least underappreciated. It\u2019s not the sort of fantasy built to sell today. It doesn\u2019t offer vast lore or realistic worldbuilding. It doesn\u2019t try to sweep the reader away into epic battles or intricate magic systems. Instead, it belongs to a very different lineage, closer, perhaps, to writers like Francisco de Quevedo or Jonathan Swift, who used the fantastic not to escape from reality but to distort and exaggerate it in order to criticize it. And while it&#39;s unlikely that Ende was directly influenced by Quevedo, he was famously inspired by Borges, who in turn was a passionate admirer of Quevedo. All three of them shared something fundamental: a fascination with the paradoxes and illusions of time. </p> <p>Momo satirizes",

But that\u2019s about it when it comes to characters. I\u2019m not sure if I just read it wrong, but I truly could not care less about anybody in this story.

It&#39;s much closer to the Early Modern period. Here&#39;s why:</p> <p>1 - Most fantasy worlds revolve around trade, currency, and an early &quot;capitalist&quot; economy instead of feudalism.</p> <p>2 - Just having a king doesn&#39;t make a setting &quot;medieval&quot;, and in many fantasy stories the monarch is an absolute ruler, which is more in line with the Modern Age, while medieval kings had to share their power with numerous feudal lords.</p> <p>3 - The fashion we often see in fantasy like corsets, wide skirts and structured gowns for women is also more typical of the Early Modern period, while in medieval times clothing was looser and simpler e.g t",
