I have a servo which has a rod attached to it.. I need it to stop as soon as the rod hits something or have reistance on it. (I cant use external hardware such as limit switches etc.) at the moment. My question is whether if it works if i use a shunt resistor to measure the current taken by the servo and check if it the current is having a steep increase? Is this method safe and does it not break the servo? Is it fast enough so that the servo dont break due to continuos resistance? the image shows a diagram of the set up I s",
