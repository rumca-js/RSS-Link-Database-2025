Over the years, I\u2019ve realized that the problem usually isn\u2019t the concepts but rather just not knowing where to start. Mind you - risk management will put anyone to sleep.</p> <p>So I built a tool called Scatter &amp; Sort. You dump all your messy thoughts into it, click Sort Plan, and it turns that chaos into a structured plan. Grouped, sequenced, and even filled in with suggestions you might\u2019ve missed.</p> <p>From there, you can drag tasks around, snooze tasks, collaborate, save project templates, and a few more pretty cool features. It\u2019s got just enough features to keep you moving, without turning into a bloated \u201call-in-one PM solution\u201d.</p> <p>Free 14-day trial, no credit card",

A lot of the people I work with are launching solo projects and don\u2019t have time (or energy) to figure out what to say in their ads.</p> <p>Some quick tips that might help if you\u2019re DIY-ing your copy: \u2022 Clarity &gt; cleverness: You don\u2019t need to be witty. Just speak directly to the pain point and offer. \u2022 Start with the hook: The first line is everything. Try questions, bold statements, or emotional triggers. \u2022 Focus on one goal: One product. One message. One call to action. Anything more = confusion = scroll. \u2022 If it sounds like an ad, it\u2019s dead: Talk like a human. No \u201csynergy\u201d or \u201csolutions.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re stuck on your ads or need a quick second opinion, feel free to drop a comment or DM. I\u2019m happy to give feedback or share suggestions\u2014even if you\u2019re not looking to hire.</p> <p>Would love to see",

I tried using AI but it always out thinks itself when it comes to repetitive tasks. Too many questions. But I found that if you use AI to train an RPA now you can have the benefit of running it locally for free. I think RPAs should be talked about more. The more advanced ai becomes the better we can reason to create the RPA and eliminate having to use AI API with crazy pricing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Historical-Humor7446\"> /u/Historical-Humor7446 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lcknax/training_rpas_instead_of_using_ai/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lcknax/training_rpas_instead_of_using_ai/\"",
