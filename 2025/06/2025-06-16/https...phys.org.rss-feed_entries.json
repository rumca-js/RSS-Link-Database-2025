Chemists at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU) have developed a procedure during which an in situ-formed organoautocatalyst allows for extremely effective chemical synthesis of bioactive cyclical amine compounds under mild conditions. The findings are published in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition.",
