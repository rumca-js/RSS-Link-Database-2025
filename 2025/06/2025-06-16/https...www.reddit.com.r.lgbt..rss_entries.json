Now I feel that too! </p> <p>In my forgoing heterosexual relationships I thought, I was broken and asked myself why being in a relationship was so damn hard. Physical contact, talking, spending time together took so much of my energy. I knew I was bi or pan but always thought, well I don\u2019t know what I thought but I tried to convince myself I like men too. But the last weeks (since we started getting to know each other) everything feels easy and it\u2019s not the rosy glasses, I don\u2019t feel drained, I\u2019m happy, calm, comfortable and regulated. </p> <p>I started accepting that I like women! I honestly think I\u2019m a lesbian, it feels natural for me. Tomorrow we want to watch some series at my place, I\u2019m nervous and kinda euphoric. </p> <p>Sorry for rambling, I needed to get this out of my system.
