The more you use an item, the more it degrades, until eventually it breaks. There are ways to make this process take longer, such as using Minecraft enchantments to improve the durability of your items, but you can also repair your tools. Here's how.</p><p>By placing two items of the same type and material on the crafting grid or grindstone, you can retrieve one of that item with improved durability. The new item's durability will equal the sum of the two old items' durability, plus 5% of the item's maximum uses, up to the maximum durability of the item. Repairing can help to conserve your inventory space: If you have two almost-broken pickaxes and combine them to get a new pickaxe with better durability, you also save a space in your inventory.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/orig",

While at its core, it feels familiar to what players will expect, Blighted's unique attributes waste no time in shining through, and after my time with the game at Summer Game Fest, I expect souls-like fans will have another incredible experience to sink their teeth into come 2026.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGU",

Get too close and the person driving will spot you; fall too far behind and you'll lose sight of the vehicle. It's the exact kind of mission structure we all decided was tired and needed to go away over a decade ago. The only difference in MindsEye is that you're piloting a drone instead of driving a car, so even the relatively small stakes are diminished by the fact that you can just fly really high to avoid being seen. It's not a positive first impression, especially when you factor in the confluence of concerning events surrounding the game and developer Build a Rocket Boy--from the studio's co-CEO stating that anyone sharing negative feedback about the game was being funded by an ubiquitous source, to the chief legal officer and CFO both leaving the company a few weeks before launch.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Neither is a great look, yet I still went into MindsEye with an open mind.
