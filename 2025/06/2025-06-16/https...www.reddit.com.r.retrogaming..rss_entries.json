But I feel like I&#39;ve hit a bit of a hiccup.</p> <p>I&#39;m gonna be getting a CRT TV. I know VGA CRT monitors are 480p but they tend to be smaller than I&#39;d like. So I found CRT TVs that do 480p. I found <a href=\"https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/Sega-Dreamcast-Component-YPbPr-cable-480p\">these Component cables </a>that can do 480p <strong><em>but</em></strong> it says I&#39;ll need a scaler to do it.</p> <p>But of course scalers are marketed for people without CRTs. They&#39;re also crazy expensive, or at least some of them are. At the very least it is an extra expense on my little retro journey.</p> <p>So what is my best, most cost-effective option here since I&#39;m getting it solely to do the 480p?</p> <p>And thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NikkolasKing\"> /u/NikkolasKing </a> <",

I&#39;ve only played it for about 15 minutes so far to get a feel for it before I really jump in. Is it a decent one? Is it a hated one?</p> <p>My initial impression is I will like it. There are different characters with different weapons you can switch to, just like TMNT. Seems like you have to find clues/items to progress areas.

No one expects a 60 year old lady to be into video games now and it was even less common back then I think. We would sit around and play through games like Startropics and Milon&#39;s Secret Castle while she made us some Southern style sweet tea and tell me stories from when she was a young girl. I think she was just lonely but I enjoyed her stories and appreciated everything she did. </p> <p>RIP Shirley. I think I will play Milon&#39;s Secret Castle again just for you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WangSupreme78\"> /u/WangSupreme78 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lckj01/old_gaming_friends/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><",
