While Patreon currently offers Pro and Premium plans, which carry fees of 8 percent and 12 percent of creators&#39; income, respectively, it&#39;s merging the two into a single option moving forward. The price increase only applies to creators publishing a new page; Patreon says it will continue to honor the lower Pro rate for anyone who has locked it in by August 4.</p>\n<p>Once the change is in place, things will also get a bit cheaper for creators who were operating under the Premium (12 percent) plan. Rather than continuing to pay 12 percent, Premium creators will be shifted to a custom &quot;Pro + merch&quot; plan that will come with an 11 percent fee.
