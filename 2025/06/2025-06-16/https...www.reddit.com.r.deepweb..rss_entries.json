The site looks quite ugly but they have a good selection of products and I wanted to know if anyone had any experiences with this m@rketplace before? Somebody posted on comment in a forum saying they were sc@mmed by Courier M@rket, but that was over 2 years ago, so I&#39;m not sure if it was just another m@rketplace with the same name that has since been replaced. Any help is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JJordan101\"> /u/JJordan101 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1lcv5o1/is_courier_mrket_legit/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dee",
