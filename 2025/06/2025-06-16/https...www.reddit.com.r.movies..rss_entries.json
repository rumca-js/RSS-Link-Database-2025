So many components: the rag-tag group of thieves, the ping-pong dialogue, the editing, the style of the music, the inevitable ending where it appears that the plan is going to fail but of course that is just part of the larger plan; all of these elements seem to be so closely associated with the heist film genre that whenever someone does a parody or pastiche of one, they always reference Ocean&#39;s 11.</p> <p>Obviously, there have been other heist movies since, but none have seemed to leave the same mark on the genre. At the same time, Ocean&#39;s 11 is relatively young in the film timeline (just a little over 20 years old), so what was the movie before it that people used to point to as the perfect example of a heist movie?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",

So many elements that makes this movie great and feels like it should have sequels. So much fun ideas rolled into innuendos and both visual and word puns, you know, fun for kids, fun for parents.</p> <p><strong>Potential 1:</strong> Returning cast, same actor and actresses as before, or same voice actors, either in the same &quot;body/city&quot; of Frank, or maybe a transfer to another body. Maybe a new city/person with different problems, new cast of characters, but combined with familiar characters. Love to see Bill Murray making a comeback or maybe a cameo, Chris Rock&#39;s fun voicing, and so many other iconic voice actors.</p> <p><strong>Potential 2:</strong> The world-building has been established, time to push some more buttons. Maybe a weird flu thing is going on, everyone is kinda coughing, oh god what year is this? Basically if you already introduce the world&#39;s",

Anyway, my dad told us that afternoon that we were going to go see it as our first Christmas gift. I wasn\u2019t expecting it and was so excited. I remember sitting in the theater as the lights went out and turning to my sister and saying that I couldn\u2019t believe we were about to watch it.

It walks a really fine line\u2014on one hand, it\u2019s one of the best films I\u2019ve ever seen, but on the other, it\u2019s so deeply disturbing that I probably won\u2019t rewatch it anytime soon. It had me completely locked in from start to finish, and even after the credits rolled, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a horror film, but it\u2019s terrifying in its own way\u2014intense, unsettling, and filled with powerful scenes that stay with you.

This is the second time Netflix has revived a Del Toro project that most people thought he wasn&#39;t going to make.</p> <p>Let me explain, the first time Netflix has revived a Del Toro Project was Pinocchio. Since, 2008 Del Toro had been trying to get his Pinocchio project off the ground and originally, The Jim Henson Company &amp; Pathe were helping him produce the film and at one point, Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Waits, and Christopher Walken were considered for roles. However the film went into development hell and in November of 2017, Del Toro stated that the film was dead and no studio wanted to finance it until in 2018, Netflix revived the project.</p> <p>Now, Frankenstein is the next film that Netflix has revived.
