Despite this protection, ultrasonic communication has been demonstrated as an effective method for exfiltrating data from such systems. While smartphones have been extensively studied in the context of ultrasonic covert channels, smartwatches remain an underexplored yet effective attack vector.<br/> In this paper, we propose and evaluate SmartAttack, a novel method that leverages smartwatches as receivers for ultrasonic covert communication in air-gapped environments. Our approach utilizes the built-in microphones of smartwatches to capture covert signals in real time within the ultrasonic frequency range of 18-22 kHz. Through experimental validation, we assess the feasibility of this attack under varying environ",

It was an old term from the 50&#39;s but it carries baggage from cultural misconceptions. It does not refer to a type of intelligence as being real or fake, rather it refers to intelligence as being artifice, or simply man-made. It&#39;s realness or fakeness is not in question, but it also does not accurately describe what&#39;s happening. A better term would be something like Simulated Intelligence, which dismisses the notion of it existing as a conscious entity, or even something like Algorithmic Inference if you want to keep the AI acronym. It&#39;s usage model is essentially just an internet interpreter that uses algortihms to determine pattern matching in language and reasoning to simulate our view of the internet as a conversation. it&#39;s not the AI from your old sci fi dime novels.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Actual_Engineer_7557\"> ",

You also have to give very specific instructions to get what you actually want. Even if the tech is familiar, you still end up spending hours or days just guiding the system through every detail. Half the job is explaining things that no one ever wrote down. And even when you do that, things still break in ways you didn\u2019t expect</p> <p>Yeah, some simple apps are easy to replace.

It runs <strong>completely offline</strong> using local LLMs (MLX/CoreML/Ollama) and does things like:</p> <ul> <li>Chatting with LLMs (markdown, code, streaming)</li> <li>System control (open apps, search files)</li> <li>Voice/text interface (coming soon)</li> <li>Extensible with Python agents (LangChain-based)</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s still an MVP. Before I go further, I\u2019d genuinely love <strong>brutal feedback</strong> \u2014<br/> Would you <em>actually</em> use something like this?<br/> Does it sound useful, gimmicky, or just \u201cmeh\u201d?</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to sink months into something no one really wants.</p> <p>Happy to share builds if anyone\u2019s curious.
