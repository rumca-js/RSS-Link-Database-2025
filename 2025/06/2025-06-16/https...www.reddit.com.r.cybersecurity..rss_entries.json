I\u2019ve been able to search the docs and find fixes most of the time, but it hasn\u2019t been a great experience. I\u2019ve occasionally had to wipe the machine and reinstall the VDI which sucks. Most recently, dpkg broke when I needed to install a tool for a HTB machine, and the virtualbox guest additions shit the bed. </p> <p>I know Kali has always had some issues around stability, but I feel like it\u2019s been getting worse recently.
