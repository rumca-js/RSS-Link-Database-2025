Basically it describes the percent adoption of people changing from one technology to another, but it also fits pretty wells with OS&#39;s because it can be described pretty broadly.</p> <p>Whether we&#39;re at 3.5% idk. I tend take statistics with a grain of salt. Whether we&#39;re past the early adoption threshold I couldn&#39;t tell you, but were certainly well on our way. At least the Steam Hardware Survey says we&#39;re at 2.69% (nice). There&#39;s that but there&#39;s no telling the accuracy of non-gaming pcs.</p> <p>Personally, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re all that near the &quot;Year of Linux&quot; because third-party support sucks and I think this is what will hold a lot of people back and what will cause the anti-cheat problem to mostly exist. We have to be well on our way to the Early Majority for that to happen IMO.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
