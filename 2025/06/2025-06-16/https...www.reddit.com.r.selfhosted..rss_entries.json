While building Docucod \u2013 our platform for generating and maintaining technical documentation \u2013 we needed a simple, fast, and flexible way to host the docs.</p> <p>We started with Next.js + Vercel, but it felt like overkill. SSR wasn\u2019t needed, and we ran into vague webhook errors and deployment issues. It felt like too much complexity for a static documentation site.</p> <p>So we built Dory \u2013 a minimal static site generator optimized for technical documentation. It&#39;s built with Preact, Vite, Tailwind, FontAwesome, Mermaid, and Typescript.</p> <p>What makes Dory work for us: \u2022 Reads a folder of .mdx files \u2022 A single dory.json defines structure/layout \u2022 No SSR, no cloud lock-in \u2022 Fast builds, minimal config, deploy anywhere</p> <p>The goal with Dory is to keep things truly simple \u2014 easy to set up, easy to use, and effortless to deploy for anyone building static documentation.
