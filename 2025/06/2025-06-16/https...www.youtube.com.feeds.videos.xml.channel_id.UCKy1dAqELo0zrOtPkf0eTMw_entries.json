        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nCD Projekt wowed the internet after a Witcher 4 demo running on a base PS5 was showcased at an Unreal Engine 5 event. The've has since confirmed it's taking a \"console-first\" approach to the game, and though it may upset PC gamers, dev team CD Projekt RED has good reason. Cyberpunk 2077 was developed with high-end PCs in mind, and then scaled down for last-gen consoles PS4 and Xbox One. Cyberpunk 2077's launch on those platforms was a trainwreck, to say the least, and somethng CDPR wants to avoid for The Witcher 4. In other news, Borderlands 4's standard edition will not make the price jump to $80, instead launching at $70\u2014likely in response to the absolute beating Gearbox's Randy Pitchford took online after his comments on a possible price hike for the game. And finally, Nintendo's Switch 2 is a hit, but a few Pok\u00e9mon fans aren't having a great time after transferring\u2014and losing\u2014decades of Pok\u00e9mon saved game progress.",
