        "description": "In this powerful lecture from the We Who Wrestle With God tour, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson explores why stories aren't just entertainment\u2014but the essential structure through which we perceive reality, aim toward meaning, and shape our lives. From biblical archetypes to everyday struggles, Peterson weaves a compelling argument that our suffering, identity, and moral choices are all governed by the stories we believe and the sacrifices we're willing to make. Drawing on deep psychological insight and ancient wisdom, he reveals that without a unifying aim, we drift toward bitterness and chaos\u2014but with the right sacrifice, we forge a path toward meaning, community, and spiritual alignment.\n\nThis \u201cWe Who Wrestle With God\u201d tour stop was filmed in Reading, PA on October 14th, 2024.\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
