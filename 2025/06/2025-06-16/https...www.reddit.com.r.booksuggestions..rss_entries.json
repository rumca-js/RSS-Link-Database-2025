Most of the books I\u2019ve seen for adults tend to be very spice heavy and seemed to be less of a plot than romance. Are there any historical romances for YA or adults where there is more than just spice and love?</p> <p>I\u2019m open to crossings of different genres with the historical romance. I love fairy tale retelling as well which tend to be historical romances.</p> <p>Some books I\u2019ve liked is Sixteen Scandals by Sophie Jordan (this was just after it came out so it\u2019s been a minute), A Company of Swans by Eva Ibbotson, Olivia Twist by Lorie Langdon, the River of Time series by Lisa T Bergren, Love, Lies, and Spies by Cindy Anstey, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, and the Stalking Jack the Ripper series by Kerri Maniscalco</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Green-485\"> /u/Successful-Green-485 </a> <br/>",

I\u2019m not looking for a textbook, but rather something deeply human. A book that makes you reflect on life, people, and yourself. Memoirs, therapist case stories, philosophical insights, or emotionally resonant nonfiction, I\u2019m open to it all.

There is one exception, Clancy. He doesn&#39;t have to be dead for the necromancer&#39;s to control him.

But i want these questions answered from an evolutionary perspective, analysing each behaviour and emotion we humans possess, and why do we possess them. coz we mostly lived in tribes so our brains still carry the same mechanisms that we developed back then.

Also, really like top gun, risky business or purl harbor (2001). I\u2019ve never been really into reading, but I figured there would be more books like these than movies and I love historical fiction. I would appreciate anything like those movies as a book similar to the outsiders because I did like readying that when I was younger. I remember enjoying the style because I didn\u2019t have a hard time visualizing the story.

Bonus points for books with female protagonists. No smut please because that would be awkward as hell lol</p> <p>Thanks :)</p> <p>Also for context \u2013 I am in my late 20s.
