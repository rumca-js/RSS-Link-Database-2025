On one hand it feels like there are plenty of genuine benefits to Opera and a lot of the things on there do sound attractive and cool. On the other hand I feel like Opera is always at the butt of every joke, even moreso than Microsoft Edge. Like every time I brought up Opera or someone found out I used it I would get ridiculed for it, and eventually got rid of it for chrome. I don\u2019t remember exactly why but Chrome is pretty good I suppose.</p> <p>So I just want an answer, is OperaGX worth using?

Youtube especially was a huge problem, seeing as the websites user interface began turning very choppy/laggy and slow after a while of watching videos. I decided to try yet another browser to see how that would handle these issue&#39;s. So brave was the one I decided on and in terms of just general performance it was very similar to chrome and pretty fast while keeping a clean aesthetic unlike Opera. Sadly after using Youtube for some time I encountered the same lag and slowness that I experiences in the other browsers.
