Q to the continued cool of Andor and a miraculous show about a fungus that can heal all illnesses, here are Guardian readers\u2019 favourite shows of the year to date</p><p>(Disney+) Andor is a cool, intelligent look at how fascism grows and the cost of resistance. It may be set in a galaxy far far away, but it is in an entirely different universe to any other Star Wars production. No lightsabers; no magic space wizards; barely a stormtrooper in sight \u2013 until the grim and horrifying mid-season climax. Who knew committee meetings and wedding parties could be so gripping? It\u2019s as though George Lucas placed the keys to his kingdom in the hands of John le Carr\u00e9 instead of Disney. Remember that fizz of excitement you got as an eight-year-old heading in to see A New Hope? Andor makes this 55-year-old feel the same way. <strong>Russell Jones, Cheshire</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/16/your-top-tv-of-2025-so-far\">Continue re",

Sounds a lot like Die Hard, right? Yippee ki-yay, knock-off merchants. Jon Foo plays a down-to-earth ex-special forces soldier whose day watching cartoons on the sofa is ruined when the villainous Cooper (Clayton Norcross) marches his goons into a downtown bank and rounds everyone up, including Michael\u2019s incredibly annoying wife and child. (In fact they are so irritating that you may find yourself wondering uncharitably if Michael shouldn\u2019t just let the baddies get on with their day in peace.) Cue a man on a mission movie with a couple of twists but very few actual surprises up its sleeve.</p><p>The a",

Short stories are not novels in miniature, or parts of novels pruned to stand on their own. Without the luxury of space and looser pacing, they demand of the writer a linguistic precision and compression that, at its most radical, borders on the poetic, and which across the breadth of a novel would feel wearying. Novels need room to breathe. The writer expanding their scope therefore faces a difficult adjustment: guarding against density while ensuring they don\u2019t get lost in the space.</p><p>For Wendy Erskine, the move to a larger canvas feels entirely unforced.
