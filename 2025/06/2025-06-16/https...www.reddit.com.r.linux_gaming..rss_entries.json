Temps were fine, nothing maxed out - resulting after investigation that it is most likely a driver issue. </p> <p>I had a few questions about linux AMD drivers and the 9060XT</p> <p>A) do the drivers naturally support FSR4<br/> B) is there a 9060 release yet for Nobara?

I&#39;ve tried scripts on steam forums, gamemoderun, and just normally running the game and nothing works. Whenever I am close to another person or some other particle/entity (smoke, explosion, etc.) the game does a weird stuttering thing where everything is clearly still running at high FPS but if I move my camera it freezes temporarily. It&#39;s extremely annoying and remains even with V-Sync enabled. I have the specs to run the game as under any other circumstance it consistently hits 144 FPS even with high graphics enabled, yet the only real way I&#39;ve mitigated this issue is by lowering the graphics which I shouldn&#39;t have to do. What have others done to get CS2 running properly?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nezzled\"> /u/nezzled </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
