After this round everything will go back to normal.</p> <p>Also another problem that occurred to me the last 2 days is the fps drop when im moving my mouse, again it will start at random time and then i will move my mouse the fps from 150+ will go to 10-15, if i stop moving the mouse the fps will continue at 150+. So if will look at a place with a lot going on i will be okay, but if i move the mouse then boom 15 fps and full of tearing. </p> <p>Ps The temperature of the laptop tested and its perfect, repasted it like 2 month ago</p> <p>Not a n",

At the time I purchased them, I was on windows and was riddled with dropouts for them. The windows Xbox accessories app wouldn&#39;t connect to them half the time, and I had so many issues updating the firmware. Even after updating the firmware and purchasing the xbox dongle, they still had frequent dropouts on windows. Got very frustrating for Elden ring boss fights (killed one of my closest Malenia attempts). </p> <p>I&#39;m now on linux and the controllers continue to have dropouts. Do people have a more reliable experience with the 8BitDo controllers, or have recommendations for any other high quality, reliable controllers? My top priority is consistent wireless connection.

I mostly use the 3090 for compute, but sometimes I just want to play some games on it. Issue is, I think EAC games (Elden Ring Nightreign for example) won&#39;t load properly and close immediately.</p> <p>Weirdly enough; this is even the case when I don&#39;t use another gpu, but leave my 3090 in the non-primary pci slot. (I use an X570 Taichi pci8x8).</p> <p>Moving the cards around isn&#39;t exactly an option either since the 3060 is smaller and blocks less airflow compared to the 3090.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried using DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=&quot;NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090&quot; %command%, but that just gives a blackscreen (nvidia-smi does show it being used tho)</p> <p>Also changing my x11 config to render on the 3090 while passing display onto the 3060 does work; but again I think it gets blocked by EAC (?).</p> <p>It does work fine in games that don&#39;t use EAC like Baldurs Gate 3.</p> <",
