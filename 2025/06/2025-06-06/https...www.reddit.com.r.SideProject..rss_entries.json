This inspired me to create MealChaos, an app designed to simplify this process. By simply taking a photo of your meal, the AI analyzes the ingredients and estimates the calorie content, saving you time and effort. My goal is to make calorie tracking effortless and more accurate than just calculating in your heads, helping users maintain their dietary goals without the hassle of manual input. </p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on how MealChaos performs and how I can improve it further.</p> <p>Android: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vanti.mealchaos\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vanti.mealchaos</a></p> <p>iOS: <a href=\"https://app",

Before building anything, I know I should create a landing page focused around that keyword and add a sign up form to see if there is interest. I want to use that as an opportunity to talk to potential users before I build anything to get a solid understanding of the role any given solutions plays in how they work.</p> <p>My question is: what have you tried that worked to get that traffic. I can create a good landing page and know all about the metadata. Just not sure what else to do.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for simple advice to move the needle. The goal isn&#39;t scale.
