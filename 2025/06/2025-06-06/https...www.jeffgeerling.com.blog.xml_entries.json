You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff Geerling</span></span>\n<span class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">June 6, 2025\n</span>",
