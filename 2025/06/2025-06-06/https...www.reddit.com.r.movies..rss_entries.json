He thinks that each trip to the theater should be to see something new, while I\u2019m all for seeing new things, but also like knowing that I\u2019m going to enjoy the experience I\u2019m paying for from time to time. </p> <p>We both have A List subscriptions, and generally I\u2019ll go to the movies alone when I\u2019m going to see something again, while we go together for things we haven\u2019t seen yet. </p> <p>Do you rewatch films? If so do you do so in theaters or wait for it to be on streaming? What are some factors that generally influence your decision to rewatch? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adrian-alex85\"> /u/adrian-alex85 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l4xmn1/do_you_rewatch_movies_in_theaters/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

I would say in terms of cruelty, he probably does the most fucked up things of any villain from the last few years, including to his own men</p> <p>We know very little about his backstory other than that his family was killed early on in the wasteland, leaving him with only the teddy bear to remember them by. As a result, Dementus commits heinous acts just to feel something, anything. While it gives him an initial rush of adrenaline, we see how he has to do worse and worse things just to feel something, until it\u2019s never enough. In his old age, he\u2019s extra unhinged and obsessed with misery. In his \u201cthere is no hope!\u201d speech, I kind of interpreted Dementus as being upset with the id",
