This means that I was able to create a script that simply adds my wpa_supplicant.conf and ssh file to enable Wifi and SSH on the first boot of the OS. Then I boot my device and I am able to immediately use my device over an ssh session without a monitor! </p> <p>Fast forward to me revisiting the PI today and I see this in the wiki:</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: Previous versions of Raspberry Pi OS made use of a wpa_supplicant.conf file which could be placed into the boot folder to configure wireless network settings. This functionality is not available from Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm onwards. </p> </blockquote> <p>I did some research and it seems like the developers did this for no particular reason. It&#39;s pretty much textbook enshittification to force us to use the official Imager in order to set password, enable SSH, and setu",

I\u2019ve mounted the screen on a pivoting arm to make it more functional, but I\u2019ve run into a big problem\u2014those ribbon cables really don\u2019t like to move. They only flex in one direction, and I need the screen to pivot in at least three (up/down, left/right, tilt), which causes the ribbon to twist or bind. I\u2019ve tried a bunch of things\u2014different ribbon lengths, adapters like the 15-pin to 22-pin converters from Adafruit, even tried routing the cable differently or gently twisting it\u2014but nothing works reliably. I also tried using HDMI converters, but of course, this screen only works with DSI, so that was a dead end. I\u2019ve looked into Ethernet-based extenders too, but they\u2019re either out of my budget or too janky for this kind of high-speed signal. What I really need is a super flexible DSI ribbon cable (15-pin, 1",
