The need for speed? Or, if you\u2019re young enough not to get that reference, do you feel the need for vivid colors and perfect black levels on your gaming PC? Then upgrade to an OLED monitor already! Today, you can get a 27-inch ASRock model with a super-fast 360Hz panel from Newegg <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/asrock-phantom-gaming-pgo27qfv-27-qhd-hdmi-30khz-510khz-48hz-360hz-dp-30khz-510khz-48hz-360hz-oled-black/p/N82E16824946006\">for just $575 even</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That 360Hz panel is definitely the standout feature here, as most of the OLED monitors in this price range settle for 240Hz. That makes this 27-inch 2560\u00d71440 panel ideal for fast-paced online shooters. Otherwise, the design is pretty basic. It does come with a USB-C port that supports video, but it\u2019s best for desktop PCs\u2014with just 15 watts of charging, you\u2019ll still have to",

The size of it meant that it was never going to be something I could place on my desk without it looking out of place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was heavy too. But the base was skinny, so it wobbled when I moved it. I figured if it fell off the side of my desk it was going to cause some serious damage \u2014 if not to me, then my floor. So, under my desk it went to live, and it stayed there next to my legs as I played endless rounds of <em>Day of Defeat</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The position worked from a practical point of view, in that I had more space to spread out on my desk. I was glad it wasn\u2019t blowing hot air anywhere near my face, too. Overall, I was happy \u2014 I had a solid, reliable workhorse that wasn\u2019t an eyesore or a drop hazard.</p>\n\n\n",

While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, higher-quality streaming, and just a better all-around experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve tested numerous VPNs and run their servers through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on network averages. My picks showcase the very best with the fastest download speeds, the fastest upload speeds, and more.

It\u2019s a fascinating technology, and there are some experiences that just can\u2019t be had without a VR headset. But VR gaming as an industry is struggling in 2025. Gamers and game developers are largely reliant on Meta\u2019s Quest platform, and Meta is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1348335/meta-doesnt-know-what-to-do-with-its-new-1500-meta-quest-pro.html\">neglecting VR gaming while in pursuit of the metaverse</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only plausible challenger? Valve, who breathed life into the handheld PC gaming space with the Steam Deck. Valve is the only company with enough influence and resources to do the same thing\u2014and if Valve\u2019s long-rumored Deckard headset lives up to its potential, us VR gamers might finally get what we\u2019ve been hoping for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp",
