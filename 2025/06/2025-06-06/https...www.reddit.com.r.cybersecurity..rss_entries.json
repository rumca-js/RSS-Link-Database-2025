I am about to finish my compTIA A+ certificate, I am enrolled in a Cybersecurity Associates program, I am at an internship for tier 3 help desk. I was hoping to see what more I can do. I know cybersecurity is very broad and also not entry level. I am going to be getting the CCST certificate at my school this semester and then possibly with CCNA or Sec+. I am also trying to build some projects to display my skills on a budget. Currently I am using VMs to have windows server 2019 to create an Active Directory server for other windows VMs on my computer. I was wondering what the best way to display this project on my resume would be? Also, do you have any other recommendations on what I could do with a system like this to gain more knowledge and skills? Are there any other basic projects you recommend? Also, is anyone willing to look at my resume and help me know of changes I could make to it?</p> </div><!-- SC_",
