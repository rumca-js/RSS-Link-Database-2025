His radical approach earned him the nickname of \u201cRed Pabst\u201d, and when Hitler was elected to power in 1933, Pabst reacted by taking his family to&nbsp;the United States. He intended to emigrate permanently, but what was supposed to have been a brief trip back to Austria to visit his sick mother saw Pabst detained inside the Third Reich for the duration of the second world war.

It packs plenty of intrigue into 45 minutes. Written by Uzo Oleh, Beth stars Nicholas Pinnock and Abbey Lee as Joe and Molly, an interracial couple longing for a child as they struggle with IVF and ponder adoption (\u201cI want our kid to look like both of us\u201d). Eventually, an apparent miracle happens and Imogen is born. But soon, the circumstances around her conception \u2013 and Abbey\u2019s relationship with her doctor \u2013 become mysterious. Pinnock and Lee do a sensitive job of rendering the retreating intimacies of their collapsing relationship. <br><em>Channel 4, from Monday 9 June</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jun/06/beth-to-fubar-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week\">Cont",
