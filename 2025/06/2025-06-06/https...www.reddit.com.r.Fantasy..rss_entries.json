I appreciated the premise and admired the effort that went into the world-building. I understand what Jemisin is trying to achieve. But for me, it didn\u2019t land, because the novel mostly tells us how to feel instead of making us feel.</p> <p>What surprised me most though was the quality of the prose.

We follow the incredible story of a world-weary colonel in a fictitious medieval Engineering Corps as he uses ingenuity and stubborn pragmatism to defend a city against a bloodthirsty army hellbent on racial extermination.</p> <p>Colonel Orhan is an unlikely protagonist. He describes himself as cowardly, cynical, and deceitful - and he\u2019s not lying. Orhan is a disenfranchised minority who was once enslaved by the Robur Empire but rose through the ranks as a competent engineer and earned his freedom through sheer cleverness.

In fact I&#39;m super slow. For example: I started reading discworld now about an year ago and have read only 6 books so far. And I know I should be reading those in less than a week! Problem is, I get distracted really easily (genuinely concerned I have ADHD atp), or just don&#39;t have the time. I think and dream about reading all day at school, and when it comes down to actually reading I read max 30-40 pages and stop. </p> <p>So, after reading a bunch of discworld, I wanted to get into some more serious and heavy fantasy series (although I love the way Terry Pratchett parodies the genre). I have a bunch I know about in mind, but I&#39;m really concerned I might not finish them or be stuck on them for a long, long time, even if I get hooked, just because I&#39;m just too slow and will get frustrated.
