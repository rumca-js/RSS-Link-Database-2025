To do so, I&#39;ve crafted two virtual journals; one for tarot, one for runes, and I want to share them with you.</p> <p>These simple journals allows you to save your tarot and rune readings (and their context) to your browser, or download them as CSV files. It is made for diviners who want to streamline their practice and claim complete ownership of their data, to store or analyze.</p> <p>No physical tarot cards or runes? No problem, just use the Psykeon Virtual Tarot Deck &amp; Rune Set directly from within the programs.</p> <p>They are both entirely free, and run directly from your browser, even offline.</p> <p>Licensed under the GNU GPL v3, you are welcome to tinker, share, and evolve these journals accordingly.</p> <p>For those interested, you can grab the files on my GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/PsykeonOfficial/psykeon-tarot-jo",
