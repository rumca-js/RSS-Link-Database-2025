        "description": "Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune isn\u2019t just science fiction\u2014it\u2019s science fantasy, and few books have ever blended the two so perfectly. In this video, I explore how Dune uses its iconic sandworms to create a world where sci-fi tech and fantasy metaphor collide.\n\nThe sandworms (Shai Huluh) of Arrakis aren't just monsters\u2014they're dragons, hoarders of power and guardians of transformation. From Paul Atreides\u2019 arc to the religious structures of the Fremen, Dune draws from fantasy more than it gets credit for. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n\ud83d\udcda My Books:\nNeon Ghosts: A Witch's Sin Hardcover: https://shop.wraithmarked.com/collections/standard-editions-1/products/neon-ghosts-a-witchs-sin-hardcover\nBreach of Peace: https://tinyurl.com/BoPTLT\nRebels Creed: https://tinyurl.com/RCTLTDG\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch & Signed Books: https://www.danielbgreene.com\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DanielBGreene\n\ud83c\udfa5 Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-EqiFg67s2Nd0imgRXg5w\n\ud83d\udcac Discord: https://discord.gg/xUzhVv4\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://w",
