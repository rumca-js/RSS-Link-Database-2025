For example I use to simply just click the thumbstick buttons to pop up the steam menu but now they do nothing, same with a few games some bindings just straight up dont work, I&#39;ve tried using the community bindings but all of them are from 2020 or before so Im guessing the bindings have been outdated or something. Ive tried looking it up on what to do but tbh I have no clue what im doing, I tried binding it myself but I have no clue what goes where. I&#39;m just completely lost if anyone is out there whose better at navigating this than I am, Im beggin ya please helppp. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Joebebs\"> /u/Joebebs </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality",

I love that it&#39;s affordable price of entry has introduced VR to a huge number of people and greatly swelled our ranks to where AAA developers should pay attention. Emphasis on the &quot;should.&quot; More people in the Steam Hardware Survey literally own a VR headset than own AMD graphics cards, but you don&#39;t see _ANY_ game developers ignoring AMD graphics cards, let alone AAA developers. Which takes me to the downside...</p> <p>As a mostly PCVR enjoyer I absolutely _hate_ how badly it&#39;s driven down the <strong><em>lowest common denominator</em></strong> as far as performance. Unlike flatscreen gaming where console gamers will inevitably &quot;graduate&quot; to PC and demand more from their hardware and games, or at the very least move to the latest and greatest console, too many Quest buyers accept that it&#39;s phone quality performance is all there is and all there will ever be",
