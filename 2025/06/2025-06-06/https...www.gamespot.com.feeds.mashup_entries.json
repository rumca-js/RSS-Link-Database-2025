The trailer showed a wide variety of party games, promising 60 in all, featuring a wide array of Lego brick styles from across the brickiverse.</p><p>Lego styles shown include Space, Pirates, and Ninjago, with settings and styles to match those through the various minigames. Like any good party game, you're always challenged with something new, so that meant different perspectives and types of games, from racing around a track to avoiding monsters, to painting the floor and more.</p><p>The announcement promises both Challenge Zones and minigames, cross-platform online play, and tons of minifigure customization. In fact, given all the permutations, you could make more than 1 billion minifig configurations.

At its beating, mechanical heart, however, Lies of P's first DLC expansion is a tale of personal tragedy and vengeance. While developer Neowiz hasn't implemented any drastic changes to the game's underlying mechanics in Overture, its storytelling has improved, further building on the atmospheric Belle Epoque-infused world it created as a much darker and more twisted spin on Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio. \"Most unfortunately, in the lives of puppets, there is always a 'but' that spoils everything,\" is a popular quote attributed to the Italian author. In the case of Overture, this is fortunately not the case.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than being a conventional prequel, Overture sees Geppetto's eponymous puppet travel back in time alongside his faithful companion, Gem",
