        "description": "*RED BAND* This trailer is not for the faint of heart so put on your big kid undies and strap in for a violent, expletive-ridden good time. After being pulled through a portal to Mojoworld, Deadpool sees a chance to get rich\u2014like really rich. He signs a sketchy contract without reading any of the fine print and then it\u2019s off to visit a bunch of locations from across the Marvel Universe, battling against iconic (and not-so-iconic) villains.\nFeaturing the franchise\u2019s unique blend of parkour and combat: If you can imagine it, you can probably do it. Sure, you can simply stab or shoot your enemies, but where\u2019s the fun in that? Punch someone while holding a grenade? Check. Take your recently exploded-off arm and throw it at the bad guys? Gross, but also check. The limit does not exist!\nFeaturing Neil Patrick Harris as Deadpool, experience parkour and combat with over-the-top moments like only the merc with the mouth can pull off.\nMarvel\u2019s Deadpool VR incoming Late 2025. Only on Meta Quest ",
