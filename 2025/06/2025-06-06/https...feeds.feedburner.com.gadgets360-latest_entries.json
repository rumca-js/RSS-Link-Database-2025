        "description": "At WWDC 2025 next week, Apple is expected to preview its upcoming OS iterations. While the rumour mill has suggested big changes coming to iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and most recently, visionOS 26, watchOS 26 may not be too far behind. As per a report, the Cupertino-based tech giant could finally introduce support for a highly requested feature on the Apple Watch \u2014 third party Control Centre widgets.",

        "description": "The Realme GT 7 and 7T deliver a powerful performance in terms of battery, display, and overall capabilities. The 7000mAh battery, combined with 120W fast charging, sets a benchmark at this price point, while 6000 nits of peak brightness makes them brighter than the iPhone 16. The camera department is not the biggest highlight of the GT 7 series, though. For gaming enthusiasts, the phone can deliver on every front. Keeping in sync with market trends, the GT 7 and 7T feature a host of AI enhancements, which is a welcome addition.",
