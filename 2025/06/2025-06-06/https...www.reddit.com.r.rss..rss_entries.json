So people should keep building on RSS.</p> <p>Infected by 2010s SaaS thinking, the first version of my curation app (Banquet) used custom data types. It did <em>read</em> RSS feeds. But the internals and output were custom. So when a user wanted a weekly email digest, I had to prioritise building that myself (I didn&#39;t).</p> <p>I rewrote Banquet as &#39;Zacusca&#39; for a few reasons. But one was that it should be RSS in, RSS out.</p> <p>When people asked me why I was rewriting to make better use of a dead protocol, I did feel a bit silly.</p> <p>But then when demoing Zacusca last week, I was asked about email digests. So I went to <a href=\"https://feedmail.org/\">https://feedmail.org/</a> (found via this sub), pasted in a Zacusca URL, and bang we were getting email digests.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t just about RSS. It&#39;s the underappreciated power of protocols:</p> <ul> <",
