I\u2019m mostly self-taught and would say I\u2019m pretty decent with it, especially on the backend. I usually rely on AI or online templates for the frontend since I have very little experience with CSS.</p> <p>Lately, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m really slow when building apps. For example, there\u2019s this one app I\u2019ve been working on since February. I feel tired and burned out, but I can\u2019t drop it because someone is interested in it. The problem is\u2014it\u2019s holding me hostage. I\u2019ve got other ideas and projects I want to start, but I feel stuck.</p> <p>I want to speed up my development process without sacrificing learning. I\u2019m aiming to really master Django deeply\u2014not just use it, but understand how it works under the hood.</p> <p>So how do you balance learning with building efficiently?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Butterscotch_7930\"> /u/Ok_Butterscotch_7930",

I understand the code and can make changes, if needed, but somehow I felt like this is just all? Or now is just work smarter not harder? I\u2019m sure this project that took me 2 months, would have take 8 months or more without AI. The App have been in use for some months and had no issues at all. I mean you need to understand things and what they do, but still this felt soo strange. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Perfect_Low",
