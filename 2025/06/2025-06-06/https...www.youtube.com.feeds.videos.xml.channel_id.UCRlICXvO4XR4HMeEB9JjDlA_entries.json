        "description": "Beneath the moon\u2019s south pole lies a colossal, unexplained lump of metal\u2014so dense, it warps gravity. Scientists believe it\u2019s the buried remains of a giant asteroid, now entombed beneath the massive Aitken Basin\u2014the largest crater in the solar system.\n\nWhat makes this region even stranger? Parts of it have never seen sunlight. Thanks to the moon\u2019s odd tilt, some craters are in eternal darkness\u2014cold enough to trap water ice for billions of years. And we\u2019ve confirmed it\u2019s there.\n\nThis makes the south pole the moon\u2019s most valuable real estate. NASA and China are in a race to establish colonies here. Not just for the science\u2014but for the money. Helium-3, a rare isotope ideal for fusion energy, is abundant in lunar dust. One gram of it? Worth over $1,000. All of it? Potentially $4 trillion.\n\nSo yes, the moon may look peaceful. But in the next few years, it could become the site of a very real lunar turf war.\n\nWhoever controls the moon, might just control Earth\u2019s energy future.",
