I am wondering how to start and what to do. My biggest concern is online safety, as I only have one computer. For as long as I can remember, I&#39;ve always wanted to go on the darknet/web, but I have no idea how to start and what precautions I should take. I understand that the darknet may not be &quot;hacking,&quot; but it is commonly associated with it. I am not interested in buying anything on the dark net, but it just seems so interesting that a network of underground crimes is so active and accessible; I just want to see what it&#39;s like. I am also interested in any other type of beginner hacking there is. Please leave recommendations on how to start hacking and/or how to access the darknet, and also, safety precautions I should take.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thick-Passage-3901\"> /u/T",
