I set up Gluetun in Docker on the VPS to connect to my custom VPN provider. I then ran Tailscale in Docker on the same VPS, using the Gluetun network, and advertised it as an exit node. To lock things down, I created Tailscale ACLs so that this tagged docker tailscale instance can only access my Pi-hole DNS servers \u2014 and nothing else in the tailnet.</p> <p>And voil\u00e0 \u2014 it works! \ud83d\ude80</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts on this",
