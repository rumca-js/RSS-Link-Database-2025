Has anyone solved this or have an idea?</p> <p>I use Bose QC and Sony WX ANC headphones atm.</p> <p>My idea to solve it is to use some form of gaming headset with a microphone that can be placed near the mouth with a windpuffer. The downside with this is looking absolutely crazy. \ud83d\ude02</p> <p>The second idea is to attach a usb-c microphone with puffer to the frame directed towards my head. Could probably be almost invisible if done right.</p> <p>Anyone already solved or have had the same problem? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlarBlip\"> /u/AlarBlip </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1l4ly1q/talking_with_gpt_on_commute_bike/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1l4ly1q/",
