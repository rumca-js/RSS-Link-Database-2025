        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m excited to introduce a new open-source project developed using Java and Spring Boot: a modular monolith backend application built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, Ports &amp; Adapters, and event-driven architecture. It&#39;s a great resource for backend enthusiasts looking to explore clean architecture principles and real-world application structure.</p> <p>This project offers a valuable opportunity for developers looking to deepen their backend development skills through hands-on experience and collaboration in a real-world codebase.</p> <p>It&#39;s already received positive feedback and stars from senior developers around the world, and is growing day by day.</p> <p>If you&#39;re curious, check out the project! Feel free to clone the repository, explore the codebase, and start contributing. All contributions are welcome, and I greatly appreciate any support.</p> <p>Let\u2019s build something awesome together!</p> <p>\ud83d\udd17",

Our approach is different, anyone can help improve the map, and every update gets rewarded.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in trying out a people-first, community-powered map (for free!), drop a comment below. We\u2019re looking for real feedback from developers to make this the best alternative out there.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s unique?</strong></p> <p>Instead of a closed system, our map is open to improvements from anyone. Users can add POIs, fix data, and update the map directly from our app. In return, contributors earn rewards for making the map better, especially in areas other platforms ignore.</p> <p>The result: a truly living map that\u2019s always evolving, accurate, hyperlocal, and built by the people who use it.</p> <p>You can check the first phase of our map here <a href=\"http://www.mapatlas.xyz\">www.mapatla",
