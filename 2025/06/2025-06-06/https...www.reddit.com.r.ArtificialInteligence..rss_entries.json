The effect has been that we have employed even more poeple. For many (including our upper management) this is counter intuitive, but it is a well known phenomena in the automation industry. Basically what happens is that only a portion of an individual employees time is saved when we deploy a new automation. It is very rare to automate 100% of the tasks an employee executes daily, so firing them is always a bad idea in the short term. And since they have been with us for years they have lots of valuable domain knowledge and experience. Add some new available time to the equation and all of a sudden the employee finds something else to solve. Thats human nature. We are experts at making up work.
