Not because I hated the game, I loved it, it was so fun and unique, but it is like I felt entitled to fun and enjoyment and gameplay and story this game gives me because I installed it, but I don&#39;t want to waste too much time with it,</p> <p>Compared to games K have purchased with my own money, like Luigi&#39;s Mansion Dark Moon for the 3DS, I have spent like a hundred hours in this game playing online and the story mode and I loved it and never felt rushed to finish this game so I could move on to the next game,</p> <p>Other games I have bought played and felt similar to Luigi&#39;s Mansion is stuff like Cuphead and Celeste and Far Cry series and ",
