Normally, boron, in the form of boric acid, is passively absorbed by plant roots and transported throughout the plant via diffusion. However, boron is often scarce in soil, particularly in arid regions, making passive absorption impossible. To combat this, plants have evolved proteins that actively transport boron from the soil into the plant.",
