Everything builds and runs fine, but even after updating the CSS files inside the <code>web/css/</code> directory and rebuilding the image, the browser keeps using the old CSS styles. I\u2019ve verified the updated files are present in the image (<code>docker exec</code> into the container shows correct contents), and I\u2019m not using any CDN.

It contains only 18 entries instead of the 29 in the native version. As far as I could see, no other environment variable differs between the two consoles.</p> <p>To explain it a bit more and how I get around it, I would like to present you an example. I installed Git on my Windows host. The location is added to my PATH variable and I can run it from the native PS console. This is not the case in Docker Terminal. To work around this, I edit my Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file ($Profile) and run a piece of code to add the location to the PATH variable when it is not included. </p> <p>Why do PATH differ in both consoles?
