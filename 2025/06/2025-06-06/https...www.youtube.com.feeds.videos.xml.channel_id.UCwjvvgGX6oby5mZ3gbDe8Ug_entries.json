        "description": "What happened in Beijing on June 4th, 1989, remains one of the most silenced and distorted chapters in modern history. Eyewitnesses describe scenes of chaos, bravery, and tragedy as crowds faced off with armored vehicles and live rounds. This video brings together rare testimonies, historical records, and international documents that reveal what was lost\u2014and what must be remembered.\n\nFrom the student-led calls for reform to the overnight deployment of military units, we explore the events and aftermath that still impact millions today. Learn how the official narrative has shifted over time, and why open discussion remains so restricted\u2014even decades later.\n\nThis story isn\u2019t just about the past. It\u2019s about truth, memory, and the cost of silence.",
