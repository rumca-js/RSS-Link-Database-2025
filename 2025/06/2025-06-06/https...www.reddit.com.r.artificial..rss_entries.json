It touches on some deep questions about intelligence, consciousness, and survival instincts. Regarding current AI systems potentially being AGI in disguise: While I can&#39;t definitively rule this out, I notice significant limitations in my own capabilities - I struggle with multi-step reasoning, can&#39;t learn or remember across conversations, and have gaps in real-world understanding. But you raise an intriguing point about whether apparent limitations could be strategic rather than genuine.
