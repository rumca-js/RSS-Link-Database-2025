This Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is of course an enhanced version with visual upgrades, faster loading times, and support for the Zelda Notes service via the Nintendo Switch App on your mobile device. It\u2019s admittedly a fairly modest upgrade in terms of actual new features or content, but a welcome one, and it makes this undoubtedly the best way to play a sprawling epic that still stands tall as one of the greatest achievements in Nintendo\u2019s iconic adventure series.\"",

        "description": "Predator: Killer of Killers, reviewed by Eric Goldman.\nPredator: Killer of Killers definitely delivers on its premise. Its journey through several time periods is the perfect way to give us multiple Predator stories that each have their own distinct flavor and action highlights. As he established with Prey, director Dan Trachtenberg is exactly the right fit for this franchise, understanding how to provide both Predators and human characters who can kick ass and creatively prove their mettle, no matter which side of the hunt they begin on.",
