PC manufacturers will need to implement Microsoft\u2019s specifications for USB-C ports in a standardized manner. Previously, these specifications already existed but were optional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, PC manufacturers have been able to customize the performance of USB-C ports and didn\u2019t have to fully utilize the technical possibilities of the hardware. As of right now, USB-C supports a maximum charging throughput of 240 watts and a maximum data transfer speed of 80 Gbps (or even 120 Gbps for monitors). DisplayPort and Thunderbolt are also fully supported through USB-C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Howe",

It\u2019s a great turn-your-brain-off-and-blast-things kind of game. But at this point, I have to say the original looter shooter has come a long way down from its height, which was <em>Borderlands 2</em> waaaay back in 2012. If you don\u2019t have it yet, somehow, you can <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/\">get it for free on Steam this weekend</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Borderlands 2</em> is a big leap forward versus the original game, with far better graphics, more interesting abilities, better multiplayer support, and a much, <em>much</em> better story and more vibrant world to putter around in. If you\u2019ve remained unfamiliar with it: <em>Borderlands</em> is basically a blend of <em>Halo</em> and <em>Mad Max</em>, with a focus on finding the best randomly generated guns among a ridiculous variety of bang-sticks.</",

But getting your hands on one involves more luck than sense\u2014it\u2019s insanely popular and going out of stock everywhere. Fortunately, if you don\u2019t care about the latest and greatest, this is a great opportunity because the older Switch stuff is going on sale!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a rare deal to jump on: the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Neon-Joy/dp/B098RL6SBJ/\">Nintendo Switch OLED is down to $318 on Amazon</a> (was $350). Use the cash you save to grab a few games from the eShop! The OLED version of the Switch is ideal if you plan to play in handheld mode most of the time, with its larger screen size and more vibrant graphics and improved kickstand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re mainly going to play in docked mode\u2014hooked up to your TV\u2014then you might opt for the <a href=\"",

And don\u2019t worry about sacrificing performance! Mini PCs may be tiny, but they pack <em>more</em> power than you\u2019d get in a comparably priced laptop. Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GMKtec-mini-computers-core-i9-12900hk/dp/B0DJ7957QT/\">this GMKtec M3 Plus mini PC is only $440 on Amazon</a>, an amazing 25% off (was $590).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201c$440 isn\u2019t exactly cheap.\u201d And you\u2019re right. But when you see the specs inside, you\u2019ll be tempted for sure. You can\u2019t find this kind of config in a laptop under $500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, I\u2019m talking about an Intel Core i9-12900HK processor, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. Yep, that\u2019s a fast mobile CPU and a ton of memory for the price, plus ample storage space that also boots up your system a",
