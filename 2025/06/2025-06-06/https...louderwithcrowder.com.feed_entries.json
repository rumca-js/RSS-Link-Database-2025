This is because of the very obvious biological advantages. And instead of acknowledging this blatant fact, the left has decided they would rather destroy the integrity of women\u2019s sports, while trashing the girls who dedicated so much time and energy to the game. </p>\n<p>And despite national efforts to make gender a thing again, some woke states have yet to get that memo. Subsequently, a girls' Minnesota High School softball team has qualified for the state championships, despite having a man on their team. So, while we can confidently confirm that they would have never made it this far had they stuck to biological reality, this is the adversity many girls are now facing, and it\u2019s all thanks to a deranged ideology that finds universal truth inconvenient. </p><p><br/></p><div ",
