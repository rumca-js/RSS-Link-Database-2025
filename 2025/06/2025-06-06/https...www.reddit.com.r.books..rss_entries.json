The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth</em> is an investigation by agnostic historian Bart Ehrman into the evidence for the historical Jesus. This is a topic that has interested me periodically throughout the years - and once you begin researching it, Ehrman&#39;s name is everywhere. He&#39;s the world&#39;s foremost expert on this topic. Boy was it fascinating.</p> <p>The short answer is yes*, Jesus existed, with a gigantic asterisk. Ehrman goes through the evidence here, starting with the non-Christian early sources - Tacitus, Josephus, Pliny the Younger, etc. Then he moves on to the Christian sources - principally the gospels and Paul&#39;s letters. Ehrman is convincing that you can&#39;t simply discount the Christian sources out-of-hand. They&#39;re still historical sources, even if they&#39;re sources with hu",

I&#39;m just curious to know from other therapists what&#39;s your opinion on what&#39;s real and what&#39;s romanticized about that dynamic (apart from the obvious unethical interest in the patient). Like the whole countertransference, therapist talking about their personal life, etc. To me it just sounds like someone who did very little research on psychology and decided to put it in a book, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s reasonable given that it is a work of fiction.

A brilliant book that perfectly explains what&#39;s going wrong in the world at the moment.
