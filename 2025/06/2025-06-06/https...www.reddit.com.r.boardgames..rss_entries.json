I like the thickness of the cards from the Pandasaurus version and the game is cheap enough that I would just buy it again if they get enough damage on them. We don&#39;t sleeve any cards and no one is sitting their trying to identify marked cards. We&#39;re all here to have fun and enjoy each other&#39;s company. Winning a silly card game (or any board game for that matter) isn&#39;t going to make our week.</p></li> <li><p>The game has been criticized for having too much luck. The reality is that the game has incredible depth and the skill needed to win is up there with any of the top games ",

Unlike last year I didn&#39;t have to spend two days playing war games, which meant we go through a much larger variety of activities. Before diving into this year&#39;s download of every thought in my head about the games we played (yes this post is that long), it&#39;s a good moment to reflect on how <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1d7r76c/ukge_games_games_games/\">last year&#39;s games</a> have held up.</p> <p>Our top three were Kapow!, Star Wars Legion and Ark Nova. And they&#39;re still three of our top games today. Ark Nova&#39;s now our second most played game at home despite my scepticism we&#39;d get to play it much (behind Legion, which has - inevitably - taken over a room of our home and emptied my wallet...). For a superficially light, fun game Kapow! holds up really well a year on thanks to the variety in chara",

It was a game in which you had random things inserted into one tournament bracket much like college teams in March Madness. You would start the game by deciding who you would think would win, and then have to make arguments about who should advance to the next round. </p> <p>For example, you could have Superman vs. Jelly Beans in the first round, and then have to decide who you think would win, before the prompt was revealed. If you chose Superman you would try very hard to get him into the next round, a feat made harder if the prompt ended up being, \u201cWhich do you think would taste better.\u201d </p> <p>That\u2019s about as much of the game as I remember.

I remember that there were equipmentcards that gave your character some bonusstats and possibly abilities. </p> <p>The only specific card i remember (very darkly) was some kind of exoskeleton. Either it was giving a bonus to movement or more arms, but i might be conflating some things. </p> <p>Appreciate the help.</p> <p>Edit: Seems like it was Frag or some kind of version of frag cuz the thing looks quite new in my memory and the board was (im pretty sure) made from sturdier materials than what is shown on bgg.

Recently he was describing how he wants to play a game with mini figs, cover (bushes, trees, half walls), a map, etc. Essentially a fake mini battlefield where he needs to \u201cline up\u201d shots and things of that nature. Think DND but war? This is really not up my alley, and I don\u2019t even know what to call this sort of game or hobby. He said he\u2019s always wanted to play something like this, but that he\u2019s never met anyone who\u2019d want to play. I don\u2019t think it would be my thing, but I wanted to look into this more for him, maybe I can buy figures and a map and things to give it a shot for him. I don\u2019t know what to look up to find this stuff out, please help!!!!! I\u2019ve been trying to find youtube videos or reddit posts but all I am seeing are actual board games like risk and things like that. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right subreddit.
