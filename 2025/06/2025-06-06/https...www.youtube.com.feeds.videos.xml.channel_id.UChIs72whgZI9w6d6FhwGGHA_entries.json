We already posted a review of the 16GB card and will be working on a special / full feature on 8GB cards in the next few weeks with extra depth beyond our normal reviews. In the meantime, this disassembly looks at how the cards are built and the differences in memory layout on the PCB.\n\nWatch our AMD RX 9060 XT review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9u3UPkqp_0\nWatch our RTX 5060 review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0jjxWRcp_0\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
