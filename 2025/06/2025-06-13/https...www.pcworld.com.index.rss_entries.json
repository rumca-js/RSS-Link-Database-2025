That magical tipping point for mainstream adoption has always hovered as a hope in Linux fans\u2019 minds. And indeed, 2025 seems ripe with opportunity, especially with Windows 10 facing its end in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topic has come up more than once on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@thefullnerdpodcast\">The Full Nerd</a>, PCWorld\u2019s weekly hardware podcast. So when surrounded by scores of nerds at the recent opening of Micro Center in Santa Clara, co-host Adam Patrick Murray did what any reasonable person would: He sought out Linux users in the crowd to get their take.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"I Tried To Find Linux Users At Micro Center\" widt",

Windows 11 has a bunch of hidden features that I consider unrealized gems \u2014 utilities and tools that aren\u2019t widely used, but when Windows users do discover them, most are duly impressed by what they find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such gem is the Windows 11 Voice typing tool (a voice-to-text dictation tool). I\u2019d known about it previously, but I only really realized its potential when I got a bad case of RSI in my mouse hand and thought I\u2019d have a go at dictating an article sans keyboard to give it a rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My impression after a few minutes of voice typing was that it\u2019s surprisingly accurate, despite me giving it no training. I was outputting my laptop\u2019s display to an external monitor at the time and wasn\u2019t even directly speaking into the microphone, yet the tool managed to reproduce what I was saying with near-perfect accuracy in Notepad.",
