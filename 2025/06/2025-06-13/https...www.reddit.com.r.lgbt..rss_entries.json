He&#39;s dating my best friend, he&#39;s really nice, and he&#39;s kind of like my brother. But over a few months, he&#39;s made so many homophobic and transphobic comments, and he even started talking about politics relating to the LGBTQIA+ community. I&#39;ve been friends with him for a while, but I&#39;m starting to think that he won&#39;t like me if he finds out who I am. Me personally I&#39;m pansexual, asexual, and genderfluid, and I&#39;m also part of a few different communities, which he&#39;s made comments about as well. I&#39;m just really not sure what to do because sometimes I don&#39;t like when he calls me a girl, &#39;cause I might feel like a boy that day, but I don&#39;t want to tell him in fear that he&#39;ll hate me.

I was choring around the house today and noticed our pride and US flags were looking a bit ratty so I got me some replacements.</p> <p>I spent about 10 years of my life in the Boy Scouts and know that the way to properly dispose of a US flag in a respectful manner is fairly complex, but I&#39;ve done it enough times to know how to do it by heart.</p> <p>But then I looked at our old pride flag and thought it would just be disrespectful to throw this away. Is there some sort of ceremony I can do to give it a proper send off? I&#39;ve scoured the internet and didnt really get much concrete options. Any advice would help!</p> <p>Pic attached is the new flags!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kegman83\"> /u/kegman83 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1la2oen/how_does_one_properly_dispose_of_a_pride_flag/\">[link]</a></span> ",
