I want to say it was a cereal company because Im pretty sure it had something to do with cutting the gym badges out of a cereal box and sending them in. But part of me wants to say it was a Burger King promotion for some reason. I just remember being on summer vacation and being really excited when my mom helped me the badges in one day and then kind of forgetting about it for a while until I randomly got a copy of pokemon gold in the mail. And it\u2019s not like we had Amazon packages showing up every day back then so the memory stands out. </p> <p>I\u2019ve tried googling it but there was so many pokemon promotions back then I can\u2019t find anything about this exact one. But I definitely remember it happening. I just can\u2019t remember what",
