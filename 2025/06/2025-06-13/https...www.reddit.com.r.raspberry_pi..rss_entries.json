Anyways, I&#39;m just about to build my first pi cluster and I was wondering what sizes of Minecraft servers would a 8GB Pi 5 be sufficient for hosting. I know that the pis are fully capable of running small MC servers (which will be my main use case) but would they work for larger community servers? I also know that just making a cheap PC or getting one off of Facebook is much more cost efficient and powerful but I&#39;m still curious and i really like the small form factor of the pi. Also, might be some other cards of a similar form factor (Such as the espresso panda) that would be more ideal for the task. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tacowolf238\"> /u/tacowolf238 </a> <br/> <span",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I produce a live, weekly YouTube broadcast ( <a href=\"https://EmersonAvenueSalons.com\">https://EmersonAvenueSalons.com</a> ) using 8 cameras -- mostly Canon SLRs, which I like very much except I can&#39;t change settings (too disruptive) after setup. Sometimes, a camera is slightly out-of-focus, angled wrong, etc. So I&#39;m investigating being able to Pan/Tilt, Zoom and focus (and possibly set aperture) remotely (10-20 feet away.) The RasPi HQ camera looks basically fine and PanTilt tripod bases are available, so it&#39;s down to the lens. I see many e.g. Fujinon automated TV lenses that look awesome (e.g., search T16x5.5DA-R11 on eBay or T14...). They look serious -- how could they not be great? And they&#39;re C mount -- perfect? I&#39;m not even slightly worried about electronics. But I hate to spend $200 just to be disappointed. How would these lenses work in my application (fixed mount, no recording, natural/artificial light, very little motion)",
