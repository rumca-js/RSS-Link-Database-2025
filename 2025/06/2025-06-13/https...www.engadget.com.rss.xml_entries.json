The NES's original rectangular controller was awfully unergonomic, but I still loved it, and it set me down the path of being a lifelong gaming and gadget geek. The <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-16-nintendo-snes-switch-controllers-available.html\">SNES's rounded gamepad</a> practically defined my childhood. It's so iconic, you can still see echoes of its layout in most controllers today. I didn't have much love for the Nintendo 64's triple-armed monstrosity (or that system in general), but the Gamecube's cartoonishly quirky controller was fantastic, especially when Nintendo's WaveBird finally made wireless gaming a reality. And while I didn\u2019t like the Wiimote or Wii U tablet much either, I can respect the swings Nintendo took with both of them.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"c4a0756f387849f7916f37094f2188aa\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.b",
