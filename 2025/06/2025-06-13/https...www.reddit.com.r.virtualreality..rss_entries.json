I\u2019ve been thinking about getting the Valve Index but I know it\u2019s starting to get a bit old. Was just wondering if it\u2019d still be worth getting in 2025 ? Or should I opt for a different headset ? Also I\u2019m not looking to spend a whole lot if money. If I were to get an index it\u2019d be used.

And for everyone else they can just add the multiplayer aspect as well. Besides zero caliber which visually was crap is the only fps with a campaign and isn\u2019t focused on just teams vs teams. Wish someone in the vr development community could make more of these titles. Or mod some call of duty over to vr. And another type of game I would really love to see vr take on even if it\u2019s a mod without motion controls would be assassins creed style games. I know they have nexus but it could\u2019ve been so much better. Or even just mod the flat assassins creed games to vr would be epic.

While its an almost universal improvement over Steamlink thus far, i have noticed that in some games (Into the Radius especially) the controls are almost doughy. My once trusty weapon now feels like a pool noodle more than anything, swinging from left to right everytime i try to get her on target. I&#39;d assume this would be caused by some degree of in-built controller smoothing in Virtual Desktop, i cant however seem to find any option that would cause this, would any of you happen to know what might be causing my problems?

I&#39;m looking at a 300ish price range though I wouldn&#39;t go much higher than 300.</p> <p>I am very new to VR and currently don&#39;t own any Headsets or have had any experience with them. I&#39;m looking to use it mainly for flightsim (Dcs world, etc...) </p> <p>I&#39;ve looked into the topic a bit and am contemplating the purchase of one of two headsets I&#39;ve found that seem to match what I am looking for. The HP reverb G2 and the meta quest 3 and I can&#39;t decide which I should pick or if there are any other better alternatives. </p> <p>I would appreciate any advice!
