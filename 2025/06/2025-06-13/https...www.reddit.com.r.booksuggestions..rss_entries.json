Girls that are whimsical, dreamy, and a little otherworldly. Girls that see the world through a lens that others don\u2019t fully understand. And he\u2019s while this would lean more towards soft kind fmcs, there\u2019s always a gentle rebellion to them that is badass in my opinion, They challenge norms quietly not with aggression, but with authenticity. Their refusal to conform is a kind of soft defiance. I want girls who are unapologetically their weird selves, and mmc that love them for it and don\u2019t think they\u2019re weird! </p> <p>Some examples of characters i love for reference:</p> <p>Luna lovegood from Harry Potter Anne Shirley cuthbert (the Netflix versions of her because i have not read the books) Mabel pines from gravity falls.

Recently finished the Licanius trilogy and the Bloodsworn trilogy and really enjoyed those. I&#39;d say a favorite book of mine is Kings of the Wyld if that helps as a reference. Not interested in A Song of Ice and Fire since it&#39;s not finished and likely won&#39;t be soon. Not that I&#39;m against a ongoing series just prefer to know at some point I can have a conclusion.

I want to start to read fantasy books. I really like characters or creatures such as mermaids, fairies, dragons, unicorns/pegasus, and princesses. I\u2019m okay with romance but I like it to be respectful. I am looking for a book with themes related to kindness, hope, identity, imagination, inspiration, magic, nature, peace, and/or emotions. I would also prefer a book with a \u201chappily ever after\u201d and/or positive ending. Thank you to anyone who\u2019s read this and has input. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/brianna_plautz\"> /u/brianna_plautz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1la227h/please_suggest_me_a_fantasy_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1la227h/please_suggest_me_a_fantasy",
