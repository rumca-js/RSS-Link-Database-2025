For normal video editing I&#39;ve been keeping to <strong>mod-8</strong>. But recently, for DVD archiving I moved to <strong>mod-16</strong> (it seemed a &quot;safer&quot; choice&quot;...). So I crop pointless black / cover noisy edges leaving up to 6/8 pixel borders at edges.</p> <p>However... I recently discovered x264 blurs edges if there are black bars + picture contained within a 16x16 macroblock... the black borders I retained or added.<br/> <em>(...apparently x264 assigns a higher quantizer to the whole macroblock due to the static black, so the valid picture content gets encoded with a lower quality and becomes slightly blurred within those 16 edge pixels. This is more noticeable when the picture at the edges has a uniform color/texture etc).</em></p> <p>So... asking some pros... what are the actual benefits of cropping black/noise to anything ",
