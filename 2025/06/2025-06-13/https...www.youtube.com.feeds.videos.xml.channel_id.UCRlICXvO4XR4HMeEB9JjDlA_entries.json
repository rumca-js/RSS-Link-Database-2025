        "description": "Kevin and his friend Lewis hijacked a McDonald's drive-thru speaker using a hacked two-way radio, pretending to be employees and delivering outrageous messages to customers. They played a prank involving fake promotions like free apple juice, accompanied by audio of urination, and even told one woman she'd get a free Big Mac if she exposed herself. Her furious response involved a baseball bat and a storm into the restaurant. In another instance, a baffled employee inspecting the speaker was startled by Kevin yelling at him through it. The prank duo sat across the street, intercepting orders and replying through the drive-thru system, putting their hacking skills to wildly mischievous use.",
