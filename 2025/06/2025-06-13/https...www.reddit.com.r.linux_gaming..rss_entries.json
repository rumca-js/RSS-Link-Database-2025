I&#39;ll try my best to explain what is happening, because the issue is very strange. I have installed the driver new-lg4ff together with the software to actually do some config, Oversteer. For Oversteer, I have also installed the permissions to rules.d as described in the github page and restarted my PC. I have done some configs and saved them to a profile , which works in game, but every time I change the app and alt-tab to the browser for example, the config goes back to default and the steering wheel becomes very stiff with the centering spring strengh set to max. I have to go back to the app and change the profile to the empty one (default) and then back to my profile everytime I alt-tab out of the game. How can I fix this? I point out that I never close Oversteer app, just let it run in the background and I am using Fed",

I went for this GPU as it seems like this generation&#39;s RX 580 and seems capable of handling the job for which I require, and I figured AMD driver support nudged me the rest of the way. This should last me the next 3-5 years without any need for major upgrades.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently deciding between which OS distro to try",

This especially happens more often the more activity happens on the monitor itself, like if I am alt-tabbing or watching a video or whatever.</p> <p>Note that I can get more noticeable frame rate fluctuations if adaptive sync is on in KDE setting, e.g fps going up and down rapidly if watching a video in fullscreen.</p> <p>The ",
