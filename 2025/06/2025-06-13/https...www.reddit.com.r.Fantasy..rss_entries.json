I had a good think about it, and a couple came to mind but I thought the exercise a whole was very intriguing. I identify as male, but I have related to characters all across the gender spectrum. I wondered if there are certain characteristics that I prefer in male characters that I don\u2019t in female characters and vice-versa. Is that a problem in of itself? I think it\u2019s an interesting discussion and wanted to reach out here to get other people\u2019s thoughts. I do think I\u2019ve worded this in a super messy way but I hope you all kinda get what I mean. So\u2026</p> <p>Which characters with a different gender to yourself have you really felt a connection to, and why? Do you even relate to these characters?

I&#39;ve heard that the Liveship Traders Trilogy is most people&#39;s favorite. I really enjoyed them both, I think Hobb does a good job wrapping up her books in a way that&#39;s satisfying but not really idealistic (if that makes sense). I&#39;ve got a lot of books on my to-read list so I&#39;m curious, would you recommend I continue onto The Tawny Man Trilogy? I think my concern is that, if The Liveship Traders Trilogy is a unanimous favorite, I won&#39;t continue to enjoy her books as much. Let me know if you think the rest of her work is worth reading!

You follow a reasonably linear pathway through the story of a changing cast of characters, as they fight to defeat evil and restore balance to the land. Nothing new there.

How could the creators mess this up?&quot; And honestly, I find it kind of absurd. I mean, neither dragons nor wyverns actually exist, so getting upset over how a fictional creature is depicted seems a bit pointless. If a movie replaced a tiger with a lion, that would make sense to complain about \u2013 those are real animals with clear differences. But dragons? They&#39;re fantasy creatures. If someone wants to design them with two legs and wings, why not? Especially in a self-contained universe where that&#39;s just what a &quot;dragon&quot; is. What&#39;s also strange to me is that nobody seems to argue about orcs, even though their appearances vary wildly between universes \u2013 sometimes they&#39;re big and green with tusks, sometimes they have horns, s",

Just sticking to wars between kingdoms, stories about mages, kings, evil overlords, whatever, as long as its not universe spanning abstract god entitities. </p> <p>Good examples I liked where there&#39;s practically no interactions with gods are the First Law books, Locke Lamorra, Name of the Wind.</p> <p>For example, i really enjoyed the first books of <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Storm Light archive, but by the end it&#39;s mostly just literal gods fighting gods and i couldn&#39;t care less about it.

Dominant themes include world-weariness, innocence, idealism, entropy, heat death of the universe, exhaustion or depletion of many or all resources, and the hope of renewal.

I just went back to gemmel and read winter warriors and I loved that book more than the others, nogusta was a badass and a smart insightful character, and I thought other characters were great too. The story was much more detailed and mysterious than the other stories. One thing I don\u2019t like about Gemmell is he uses the magic system in his world to spoil future events which is a boner kill for anticipation in a book. So for those who have read Gemmell who is your favorite character? I liked Druss (obviously) and decado the most and antics-carios secondly and there\u2019s others who are",
