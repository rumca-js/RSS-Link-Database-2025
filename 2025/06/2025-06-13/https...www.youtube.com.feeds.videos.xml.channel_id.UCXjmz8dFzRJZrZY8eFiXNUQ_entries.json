        "description": "28 Days Later wasn\u2019t just a hit \u2014 it redefined the zombie genre and helped kick off a new wave of horror that dominated Hollywood for over a decade. With its raw intensity, gritty realism, and fresh take on infected apocalypse storytelling, it felt like the perfect foundation for a massive franchise.\n\nYet despite the success of 28 Weeks Later, the series stalled \u2014 with no trilogy, no spinoffs, and no universe to rival the likes of The Walking Dead or Resident Evil. So what happened? Why did it take nearly two decades for 28 Years Later to finally enter production?\n\n#28dayslater #28yearslater #dannyboyle #zombies",
