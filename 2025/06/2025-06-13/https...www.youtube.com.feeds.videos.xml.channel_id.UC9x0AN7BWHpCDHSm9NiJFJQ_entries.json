        "description": "Thanks to Cisco for sponsoring me to come to CiscoLIVE 2025. This trip would not have been possible without them! Check out CiscoU: http://U.cisco.com/tutorials \n\nI went to Cisco LIVE 2025 to answer one question, \"Is there a future for network engineers?\"...are we going away? Is AI finally going to replace us? The theme at Cisco Live this year was definitely AI...you couldn't turn a corner without being bombarded by AI marketing. Answering these questions was my mission; I interviewed Cisco employees and network engineers attending the conference to get down to the bottom of this.\n\n\n\n\n**Sponsored by Cisco\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORT NETWORKCHUCK\n---------------------------------------------------\n\u27a1\ufe0fNetworkChuck membership: https://ntck.co/Premium \n\u2615\u2615 COFFEE and MERCH: https://ntck.co/coffee \n\nCheck out my new channel: https://ntck.co/ncclips \n\n\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98NEED HELP??
