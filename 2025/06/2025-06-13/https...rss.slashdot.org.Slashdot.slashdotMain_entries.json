Consumers are urged to stop using the affected devices, check their serial numbers, and request a free replacement through Anker's website. From the report: According to a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the lithium-ion battery inside certain \"PowerCore 10000\" made by Anker, a China-based electronics maker, can overheat. That can lead to the \"melting of plastic components, smoke and fire hazards,\" Anker said in an announcement. The company added that it was conducting the recall \"out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety of our customers.\"\n \nThe recalled \"PowerCore 10000\" power banks have a model number of A1263. They were sold online at Anker's website -- ",

        "description": "Apple's macOS 26 \"Tahoe\" introduces a new disk image format called ASIF, designed to dramatically improve performance over previous formats like UDRW and sparse bundles -- achieving near-native read/write speeds for virtual machines and general disk image use. The Eclectic Light Company reports: Apple provides few technical details, other than stating that the intrinsic structure of ASIF disk images doesn't depend on the host file system's capabilities, and their size on the host depends on the size of the data stored in the disk. In other words, they're a sparse file in APFS, and are flagged as such. [...]\n \nConclusions: \n- Where possible, in macOS 26 Tahoe in particular, VMs should use ASIF disk images rather than RAW/UDRW.\n- Unless a sparse bundle is required (for example when it's hosted on a different file system such as that in a NAS), ASIF should be first choice for general purpose disk images in Tahoe.\n- It would be preferable for virtualizers to be able to call a proper API r",

He added that the collectibles could have potential for high profit margins. \n\nPokemon cards have a seen a gigantic resurgence recently. Stores regularly sell of sets, including the Destined Rivals set that launched on May 30.

Multiple Apple engineers reportedly learned about the feature by watching the keynote alongside everyone else.

The company says the features will arrive \"in the coming year\" -- which Apple confirmed means sometime in 2026. \n\nApple is essentially arguing that internal development milestones matter more than actual product delivery.

The retail giants, along with Expedia Group and several airlines, have recently discussed launching corporate stablecoins that would allow them to circumvent the existing payments infrastructure dominated by Visa and Mastercard. \n\nThe companies' final decisions hinge on passage of the Genius Act, legislation currently moving through Congress that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. These digital currencies maintain a one-to-one exchange ratio with dollars and are backed by cash or Treasury reserves, offering merchants the potential for faster payment settlement and significantly reduced processing fees compared to traditional card transactions that can take days to clear.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a ",

America produces less nuclear power than it did a decade ago and abandoned uranium mining and enrichment capabilities, leaving Russia controlling roughly half the world's enriched uranium market. \n\nThis strategic vulnerability has triggered an unprecedented response: venture capitalists invested $2.5 billion in US next-generation nuclear technology since 2021, compared to near-zero in previous years, while the Trump administration issued executive orders to accelerate reactor deployment. The urgency stems from AI's city-sized power requirements and recognition that America cannot afford to lose what Interior Secretary Doug Burgum calls \"the power race\" with China. \n\nCompanies like Standard Nuclear in Oak Ridge, Tennessee are good examples of this push, developing advanced reactor f",

Instead, the northern state will turn to open-source software to \"take back control\" over data storage and ensure \"digital sovereignty,\" its digitalisation minister, Dirk Schroedter, told AFP. \"We're done with Teams!\" he said, referring to Microsoft's messaging and collaboration tool and speaking on a video call -- via an open-source German program, of course. \n\nThe radical switch-over affects half of Schleswig-Holstein's 60,000 public servants, with 30,000 or so teachers due to follow suit in coming years. The state's shift towards open-source software began last year. The current first phase involves ending the use of Word and Excel software, which are being replaced by LibreOffice, while Open-Xchange is taking the place of Outlook for emails and calendars.<p><div class=\"share_submis",

The hybrid embryos survived for 21 days, during which the fingertip-sized hearts began beating, according to findings presented at the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting in Hong Kong. \n\nResearchers -- led by Lai Liangxue at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health -- reprogrammed human stem cells to survive in pigs and introduced them into pig embryos with two heart development genes knocked out.

That tactic is limited by natural geography, however, and the US gets around half a percent of its electricity from geothermal sources. Startups including XGS are trying to change that by making geothermal energy more accessible. Last year, Meta made a separate 150MW deal with Sage Geosystems to develop new geothermal power plants.

You can watch the teaser trailer on YouTube. IGN reports: A trailer for the sequel to the classic '80s sci-fi Star Wars parody arrived today. Although it mostly comes with a special message from Brooks himself and a familiar text crawl that pokes fun at the long, long list of sequels that have come to theaters in the last 38 years, this is the most official look at Spaceballs 2 we've seen yet.\n \n\"After 40 years, we asked, 'What do the fans want?'

Scale co-founder Alexandr Wang will join Meta's \"superintelligence\" unit, which focuses on building AI systems that perform as well as humans -- a theoretical milestone known as artificial general intelligence. \n\nWang will remain on Scale's board while Jason Droege takes over as interim CEO.

        "description": "Japan must stop being overly optimistic about how quickly its population is going to shrink, economists have warned, as births plunge at a pace far ahead of core estimates. From a report: Japan this month said there were a total of 686,000 Japanese births in 2024, falling below 700,000 for the first time since records began in the 19th century and defying years of policy efforts to halt population decline. The total represented the ninth straight year of decline and pushed the country's total fertility rate -- the average number of children born per woman over her lifetime -- to a record low of 1.15. \n\nBut public and parliamentary dismay over the latest evidence of Japan's decline was intensified by the extent to which the figures undershot population estimates calculated by government demographers just two years ago. The median forecast produced by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (IPSS) in 2023 did not foresee the number of annual births -- which doe",

        "description": "During this week's Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple unveiled a secure import/export feature for passkeys that addresses one of their biggest limitations: lack of interoperability across platforms and credential managers. The feature, built in collaboration with the FIDO Alliance, enables encrypted, user-initiated passkey transfers between apps and systems. Ars Technica's Dan Goodin says it \"provides the strongest indication yet that passkey developers are making meaningful progress in improving usability.\" From the report: \"People own their credentials and should have the flexibility to manage them where they choose,\" the narrator of the Apple video says. \"This gives people more control over their data and the choice of which credential manager they use.\" The transfer feature, which will also work with passwords and verification codes, provides an industry-standard means for apps and OSes to more securely sync these credentials.\n \nAs the video explains: \"This new process is fund",
