Then I realized that there are a ton of people using it and they&#39;re thinking that it&#39;s a computer with access to huge amounts of information, so it must be reliable - at least more reliable than people. Now, ChatGPT keeps getting more impressive, but there are some things about how it actually works that most people don&#39;t know and all users should be aware of what GPT is really doing. A lot of this stuff comes straight from OpenAI themselves or from solid reporting by journalists and researchers who&#39;ve dug into it.</p> <h1>Key Admissions from OpenAI</h1> <p><strong>The Information It Provides Can Be Outdated.</strong> Despite continuous updates, the foundational data ChatGPT relies on isn&#39;t always current.
