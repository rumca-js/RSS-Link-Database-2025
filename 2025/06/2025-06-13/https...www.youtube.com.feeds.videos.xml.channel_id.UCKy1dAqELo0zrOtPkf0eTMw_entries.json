Take a look at the new featurette going over the making of the technological monster that is M3GAN. M3GAN 2.0 is releasing in theaters on June 27.\n\nTwo years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently destroyed, M3GAN\u2019s creator Gemma has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma\u2019s niece Cady, now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma\u2019s overprotective rules.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia, the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia\u2019s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

Trading cards\u2014Pok\u00e9mon specifically\u2014are a huge market for collectors, but scalpers often prevent most fans from purchasing cards at retail prices. Maybe GameStop can find a way to prevent scalpers from buying up huge stocks of inventory. In other news, Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World is outselling Switch 1 launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild by about 4x over a similar 4-day period in Japan. Mario Kart World has so far sold nearly 800,000 units in four days in Japan's retailers, not accounting for online sales.

        "description": "How would you romanticize the end of the world? IGN sat down with The Life of Chuck writer and director Mike Flanagan, as well as cast members Tom Hiddleston, Mark Hamill, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan and Benjamin Pajak to discuss the film, the core memories that would occupy the center of their universe, joining the Flanagan family and more! \n\nThe Neon film expands the Flanaverse, featuring an incredible Tom Hiddleston performance alongside the rest of the cast. In our interview with Tom Hiddleston, we also discuss how Chuck and Loki manage to be two sides of the same coin when it comes to multitudes and multiverses, and discuss how Mike Flanagan continues to successfully adapt the unadaptable.\n\nThe Life of Chuck follows the life and multitudes of Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Krantz. It adapts the Stephen King short story of the same name, of which originally appeared in the story collection If It Bleeds. Thanks for 39 great years, Chuck! \n\n#IGN",

        "description": "Directive 8020 leans into themes of paranoia, isolation, and fear of the unknown \u2013 which makes for an excellent setup for a Dark Pictures game. The developers were particularly inspired by sci-fi films like Event Horizon, Alien, and John Carpenter's The Thing, which helped establish the style of horror and sense of dread that Directive 8020 goes for, and with the focus on giving players more direct control of the action while also heightening the sense of distrust in your dwindling party of survivors, it looks to offer one of the more unique and game-changing episodes the series has seen yet.

Nintendo is touting the launch as their most succesful, outselling the original Switch over the same four-day period. Some analysts are already hailing the Switch 2 as the fastest-selling console of all time, which is great, but the common criticism, is there's not exactly a \"killer app\" akin to Breath of the Wild for the Switch 1.

Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\nWhen its performance is stable and you\u2019re explosively blasting your way through robots, MindsEye can masquerade as a serviceable action shooter for a few minutes at a time. However, its flashy graphics and cinematics can\u2019t hide its distinct lack of substance. High on ambition but low on original ideas, MindsEye\u2019s rigid mission design renders its open world largely pointless \u2013 and it\u2019s consistently undermined by vanilla combat, janky AI enemies, and its sloppy frame rate and bugs. Throw in its insultingly unfinished free roaming component and it\u2019s clear it was simply not ready to be released. If you had your sights set on MindsEye, think again.",
