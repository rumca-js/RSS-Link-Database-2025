It force opens if she swipes all the way to the left and ad pop ups pop up with viruses (which i know) it has those pop ups that say (Your phone is infected) or something.It also causes her to get ads on normal apps like Whatsapp. I do not know what to do or how to help her so if anyone knows anything about this app please let me know soon and if there are any fixes. Thank you. Also, she says the app has managed to get onto her ipad aswell somehow (she does not know how it got on there she says) and if it is a malware it may be able to gain access to her banking info so it is quite serious.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",
