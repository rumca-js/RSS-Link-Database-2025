I\u2019m planning on longer \u201cday time\u201d rounds maybe with some food or drinks or even some mini tasks. I want to play one long game rather than playing the game multiple times. My only concern is that murdered people will be out of the game and a bit bored. Does anyone know of any adaptions of Mafia (or similar games) that help solve this problem?

The Survivors win by first repairing four generators, then repairing one of the available exits. The Killer wins by injuring and hooking Survivors, generating Blood Points. They win immediately if they collect eight Blood Points. Survivors cannot truly die, but players do not get to participate while they&#39;re hooked.</p> <p>In Terrorscape, three Survivors must escape one Killer. The Survivors win by repairing the radio, then surviving five additional rounds until help arrives. They can also win by finding five Keys and starting the turn at the normal or, if they&#39;re able to, secret exit. The Killer immediately wins if they kill any Survivor.</p> <p>I",

I have learned that there are over a thousand board games released every year. I watch YouTube videos by Watch it Played and others and I just feel like I&#39;m perpetually on the outside looking in. There are sooo many games! I have played a few and liked a couple but there&#39;s got to be a better way to find my favorite game. So I ask....</p> <p>What kinds of games are out there? I don&#39;t mean the official subdivisions like Euro game and Ameritrash and other big broad categories that don&#39;t really tell you what the game is. Those tell you how it&#39;s played. It they don&#39;t tell what the game is. Something about the presentation on watch it played leaves me feeling cold and uninformed. I need information that lets me see the story behind the game and what the interesting quirky details of gameplay might be. I like interesting and quirky. </p> <p>When I go to",
