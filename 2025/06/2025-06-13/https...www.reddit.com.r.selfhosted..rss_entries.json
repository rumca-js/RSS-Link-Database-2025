I&#39;d love to expose some services to be accessed by specific people outside my LAN who aren&#39;t savvy enough to use Tailscale, however, the biggest piece of advice I&#39;ve adhered to here is that if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, then don&#39;t open ports (Which is me! I know I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know!).</p> <p>From what I&#39;ve gathered, if you&#39;re going to expose a port, then it&#39;s better to use a reverse proxy because people will use IP scanners to find open ports and try to find vulnerabilities in whatever service you&#39;re using. What I don&#39;t understand is - how is exposing NGINX or Caddy better then? Doesn&#39;t it just bump the problem up a level? Scanners would still find the reverse proxy. Wouldn&#39;t there still be a concern about someone trying to exploit vulnerabilities in the reverse proxy itself, which is the problem of ex",

No server used in between, it just uses the router capabilities to signal subscription on multicast/broadcast addresses thus computers running the program become aware of each other. The user interface is TUI for now and works on Windows and Linux. Tested on WindowsXP (with hardware from that era) and under VM for Windows95(can&#39;t make hard guarantees though, this is kinda iffy), and of course works on more modern Windows systems too.

This way, I\u2019ll have a nice-looking control panel and unified configuration across all networking devices.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already built my shopping list, but I have a big question regarding the UniFi Controller I\u2019ll be installing on a local machine\u2014specifically about privacy and security.
