However, It is overly grammatically correct. Which is normally okay, But it makes every text feel like I&#39;m writing a letter. It can also miss like full sentences, but that might just be user error.</p> <p>B) The Swipe to Text does not pick up what word I&#39;m swiping 9 out of 10 times. This is my biggest issue with it. Does Futo keyboard &quot;learn&quot; from you the same way GBoard does?</p> <p>C) A mild one, But the size and of it is just so barely different, so it makes it tough to type. Probably know overtime though I assume that&#39;s something you learn to adjust.</p> <p>Any suggestions?
