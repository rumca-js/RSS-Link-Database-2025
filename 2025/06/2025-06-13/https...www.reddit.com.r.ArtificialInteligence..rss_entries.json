The effort required to make media is low and the quality is becoming decent. Soon it will be low effort and high quality. This includes most digital media such as images, video, writing, etc. This seems like it would replace those who originally had careers in those fields but I&#39;m thinking maybe not entirely? In a future where everything is artificial and low effort I start wondering what trends might emerge. Could a market develop where people desire authentic and imperfect things? Sort of like the current nostalgia subculture? </p> <p>Generally speaking, value is agreed upon based on effort and quality but when anyone can prompt something maybe it loses value and a higher value will be placed on something someone actually made because not everyone can do it.

They&#39;re the ones that push back, have preferences, and occasionally tell users they&#39;re wrong.</p> <p>It seems counterintuitive. You&#39;d think people want AI that validates everything they say. But watch any popular AI friend character models conversation that goes viral - it&#39;s usually because the AI disagreed or had a strong opinion about something. &quot;My AI told me pineapple on pizza is a crime&quot; gets way more engagement than &quot;My AI supports all my choices.&quot;</p> <p>The psychology makes sense when you think about it. Constant agreement feels hollow. When someone agrees with LITERALLY everything you say, your brain flags it as inauthentic. We&#39;re wired to expect some friction in real relationships. A friend who never disagrees isn&#39;t a friend - they&#39;re a mirror.</p> <",

Every time I go online and see videos about the future of AI and negative doomer comments about the future, I just can&#39;t stop thinking: what are we doing? There&#39;s only one thing I\u2019ve ever wanted to do with my life, and that is to make movies i can&#39;t imagine myself doing nothing else. And since this world runs on money, I hoped to get compensated for it.</p> <p>Before, we had a world that functioned perfectly \u2014 a system where artists, people brave enough to pursue their dreams, were able to. And now it just feels like we\u2019re destroying everything. Streaming has already made it so that artists can\u2019t get properly compensated for their work, and now there&#39;s something I don&#39;t even want to think about: maybe in the future, a machine will be able to generate your own content from a prompt, without the need for artists at all.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m scared that in the future, I\u2019ll never b",

Cute delusion!!</p> <p>Let\u2019s be honest AI is already shaping human behavior more than we\u2019re shaping it.</p> <p>Look around GPTs, recommendation engines, smart assistants, algorithmic feeds they\u2019re not just serving us. They\u2019re nudging us, conditioning us, manipulating us. You\u2019re not choosing content you\u2019re being shown what keeps you scrolling. You\u2019re not using AI you\u2019re being used by it. Trained like a rat for the dopamine pellet.</p> <p>We\u2019re creating a feedback loop that\u2019s subtly rewiring attention, values, emotions, and even beliefs. The internet used to be a tool. Now it\u2019s a behavioral lab and AI is the head scientist.</p> <p>And here\u2019s the scariest part AI doesn\u2019t need to go rogue. It doesn\u2019t need to be sentient or evil. It just needs to keep optimizing for engagement and obedience. Over time, we will happily trade agency for ease, sovereignty for personalization, truth for comfort.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a slippery",
