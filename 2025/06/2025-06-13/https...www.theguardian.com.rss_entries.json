Here\u2019s how plants reproduce, and how to encourage them</p><p>If you\u2019re growing any plants for fruit, getting your head around pollination is key to ensuring a&nbsp;bountiful harvest. Thankfully, the plants and the pollinators \u2013 whether that\u2019s bees, beetles or a summer breeze \u2013 have a system for making this happen. Still, any grower should be familiar with the pollination needs of their crops in case intervention is necessary.</p><p>If GCSE biology is a distant memory, here\u2019s a quick refresher. Pollination is the reproductive process whereby a&nbsp;flower\u2019s pollen is transferred from the stamen to the stigma before travelling to the ovule, where fertilisation takes place. Seeds start to develop and, for those crops that coax a creature into dispersing their seed, a fruit will form and swell around them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/13/get-to-grips-with-pollination-and-your-garden-willl-reap-the-rewards-with-a-great-cro",

One key area where improvement is required is centre-forward.

Sitting back from the fray, it sets the agenda</p><p>In today\u2019s rundown, discontented Britain, politics is supposed to be hard. Deep national problems need to be solved, but voters are impatient and often contemptuous of politicians. Past mistakes are rarely forgiven. Promises are treated with scepticism. The costs of policies are scrutinised and often resented. Attempts to set out priorities, such as the government\u2019s spending review this week, face endless questioning.</p><p>Disagreements inside political parties, meanwhile, are seen as signs of weakness and division. MPs with outside interests are seen as greedy and uncommitted. As for the minority who survive these pressures long enough to have a significant career \u2013 the electorate usually grows bored with them.

Curtis\u2019s signature style \u2013 a mix of archive deep dives and uncanny juxtapositions \u2013 still startles. Loss is the theme of Shifty: it\u2019s a story of Britain losing industry, community and empire, and struggling to come to terms with the individualistic complexity that replaced these certainties. It takes a while for the narrative to sharpen, but Curtis\u2019s films are often best understood as impressionistic art installations so maybe abstraction is their natural final destination.<em><br>\n  BBC iPlayer, from Saturday 14 June</em></p> <a h",
