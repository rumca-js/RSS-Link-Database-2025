The site has a preexisting catalog of ~4,000 information rich pages. My weblogs show that google bot has been indexing these pages constantly with at least 1300 visits. Google search console shows that the full sitemap was fetched and they are aware of thousands of pages on our site. Where I&#39;m confused about is google search console shows 25 indexed pages, 145 pages not indexable and the rest are just unaccounted for? My weblogs also show 2 visitors coming in from google, so I do think google likes the site at least a little?</p> <p>Anyways should I expect to see google site console reflect the status of all pages in a few days or is something off? Is there some queue that happens in the background at google after it crawls a site to rank it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EverythingElectronic\"> /u/EverythingElectronic </",
