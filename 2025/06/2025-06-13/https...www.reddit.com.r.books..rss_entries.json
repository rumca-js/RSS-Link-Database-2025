I picked it up on the shelf without knowing what to expect, but it ended up being exactly what I needed at this time.</p> <p>I\u2019m torn because honestly I would love to meet the author. Talk to him. I am in recovery myself and I could relate with a lot of themes in this book. I loved how it was written. Going back and forth between perspectives, it felt like the author was writing his own biography bc of how seamless it was.</p> <p>However. I found Cyrus to be super unlikeable and way too self absorbed, especially considering he\u2019s worked the 12 steps of AA. Also, as much as I believe the author has been in recovery from how he writes, and as much as I have thought the main character\u2019s thoughts, it just seemed a little unbelievable at points.</p> <p>It just seemed like this book was rushed if anything. Like \u201cI was an addict, I yelled at my sponsor.",
