I currently work for a very large defense contractor supporting a DoD contract and I can&#39;t stand it. I hate it and I&#39;m looking for the nearest exit. I hate how combative, political, and cut-throat everything is.

At the same time it&#39;s so bloated, so for that many people often move to Ubuntu or any clean distro installing tools as needed. I also just love Arch linux (I use it as my main os) so more often than not I end up creating a Arch VM. But the problem is installing and configuring Arch everytime is a tedious process (OFC I can use something like Manjaro or anything but Nah, I don&#39;t like) So I created a custom distro based on Arch.

We&#39;ve looked into PagerDuty, did a demo and found it kinda overkill for what we need. We&#39;re a team of 8, and want a tool so our team can triage and manage alerts, and also assign on-call schedules, nothing too fancy.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked into The Hive, VictorOps and others, and recently stumbled upon Zenduty. Liked their UI, it was surprisingly simple to set up, and, besides not having a dark theme, overall really liked it. The pricing is also good.</p> <p>The thing is, everytime I search in Reddit for feedbacks, there are only (what I assume) employees, or people getting paid, posting &quot;reviews&quot; about how great Zenduty is, and how much better than others it is. And I find this to be a major red flag. So can anyone that *actually* uses Zenduty provide me some truthful feedback?
