I&#39;m looking for self-hosted software that follows the same philosophy to replace Google Drive. I want to keep full control of my files. I don&#39;t want S3 storage, even if it means reduced performance as I don&#39;t intend on hosting that many files. Having Syncthing handle the syncing seems like a good solution, but what&#39;s missing is the UI on top to interact with the files. I basically need to be able to search for files and read their content. Bonus points if it: 1. allows editing files (docs, spreadsheets, etc.) 2. has an Android/iOS app. 3. implements hierarchical tagging.</p> <p>Alternatives I&#39;ve considered:<br/> - Nextcloud: too clunky/slow for my liking<br/> - Seafile: S3 only<br/> - DEVONthink: MacOS only</p> <p>Please share your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

I followed Rclone&#39;s instructions regarding the API key but unfortunately I just couldn&#39;t figure it out. The user interface of Google Cloud must have changed because the instructions seemed inconsistent with the website, and other sources online didn&#39;t help.</p> <p>As a result I am looking for an alternative to Rclone for downloading files from Google Drive that circumvents the API key creation, or at least simplifies it.

It&#39;s a simple, private file-sharing app that you can host yourself. I just dropped v2.0, which is a complete overhaul from the ground up. What&#39;s cool about it: * Host it yourself: Your files, your server. No third-party snooping. * New UI: Modern look inspired by Material You. * It&#39;s a PWA: Feels like a native app on your phone or desktop. * Fast &amp; light: Rewritten for much better performance. * Fully open-source: MIT licensed, so do what you want with it. I built this because I wanted a simple, private way to share files without the hassle. Would love for you all to check it out, maybe even break it!</p> <p>GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/Phoenix-XShare\">https://github.com/codedbysoumyajit/Phoenix-XShare</a></p> <p>Let me know what you think.

I self-host also a password manager, Immich for cloud photos backup and other services regarding sensitive data.

When I run through the list of commands individually the connection error I&#39;m having in Nebula Sync goes away, but the script doesn&#39;t appear to load upon reboot of the raspberry pi. I checked to make sure the chomd +x worked on the script according to a web search on how to tell. I&#39;m no expert with this so relying on the web, but just can&#39;t figure out why it won&#39;t work. I&#39;ve found a few similar posts to the one linked and all are similar in creating the script and service file.</p> <p>In the script file I&#39;ve added the sudo to all commands as that is how I entered them individually at the beginning and that didn&#39;t help, I&#39;ve then removed the sudo from the script and still no luck.</p> <p>Anyone point me in a direction to look?",

It is a Python library that specializes in PDF form manipulations, providing essential functionalities such as inspect/edit form fields, filling forms, creating form fields, and many more.</p> <p>The project received some very positive feedback from the community and has been evolving since then. Right now it&#39;s at about 14k monthly pip installs and I&#39;m constantly getting new issues opened for different requests for the library. And because of the rise of its usage there are some groundbreaking major changes needed to happen to the library in order to address some of its legacy problems.</p> <p>So it is my pleasure to announce that, just this morning, PyPDFForm has released its v3.0.0 major update.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone. I have been working on this project for a few months, and I am at the point where I would love to share it with the world. I found myself getting increasingly frustrated by the guardrails and memory limits imposed by large cloud-based models, and how they lock you into their tools. This is where Atria was born.</p> <p>Atria is a fully self-hosted / offline AI building platform that puts the power back into the hands of the user. No memory limits, no censorship or arbitrary guard rails, and the best part is that it ships with plugin extensibility from day one (comes with a starter template)! You can build and save your own AI mind, fine-tune it using customizable user feedback parameters, iterate and version track to your hearts content! I am looking for some beta testers and those of you who like to break stuff or even make a plugin or two!</p> <p>I have a discord you can join here: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/z7v2F7r6Jw\">https://disco",

Great software, however, it has not been in active development for some years now, so I really need to make an effort to move onto something else. It is also my last remaining service running on Windows, so will be great to finally be free of Microsoft.</p> <p>My current email design is to have mxguarddog as the inbound SMTP service which forwards onto my email server. For outbound I have been using the Socketlabs free tier as a smarthost, however that seems to no longer be an option (they only offer paid plans now) so will likely need to look at going directly out from my own service again (I have a static IP) as my ISP does not provide an SMTP relay service. I am running a Proxmox setup, so my preference for platform would be LXC so it integrates with my backups. </p> <p>Current options I am looking at which I&#39;d be really thankful for any feedba",
