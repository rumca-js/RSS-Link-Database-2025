Most notably, there will be a new activity within them called Horadric Strongrooms. Described as a \"potent micro-dungeon,\" strongrooms will be found more frequently on higher Torment difficulties and can also be reliably found by using a Nightmare dungeon sigil that guarantees the appearance of a strongroom.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once players are inside the dungeon, players can discover a portal that will take them to the strongroom.
