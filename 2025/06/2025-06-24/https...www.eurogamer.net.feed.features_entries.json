Rematch, Sloclap's 3/4/5-a-side football game, is what <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league\">Rocket League</a> would have been based on if the world made any sense. It's not, which has resulted in a bizarre situation where you have to describe Rematch as Rocket League with people instead of cars&hellip; so, just football, then. Anyway, I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate\">Read more</a></p>",

But I don't always love games that are firmly <em>about</em> climbing. Games that are firmly about climbing are often too technical for me - they tangle me up with ropes and pitons and tricky physics systems. Too many systems. Too many meters to manage. When climbing games are at their most arcadey - say something like Jusant, or <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grow-home\">Grow Home</a> - I'm in, thoroughly in. But the best climbing I've ever had in a game was probably in Crackdown, and that's an action game that just happens to let you stick to walls and ledges. The best climbing until now, anyway.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession\">Read more</a></p>",
