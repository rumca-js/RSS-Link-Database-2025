In this review and benchmark suite of the RTX PRO 6000, we test the card for gaming performance on an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D (mostly to see if there's still scaling room), our first suite of LLM benchmarks with LM Studio, and we run thermals and acoustics. The review also includes a tear-down of the RTX PRO 6000 with comparisons vs. the NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition.\n\nOur source we bought this card from operates a custom PC building website: https://veratu.com/\n\nGrab our Large Anti-Static Modmat on the store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\nCheck out our project and soldering mat: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-project-soldering-mat\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
