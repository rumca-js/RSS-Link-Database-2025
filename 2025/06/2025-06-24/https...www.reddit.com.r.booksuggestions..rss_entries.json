The basic plot was that there was a teenage girl who can see who someone&#39;s soulmate is by touching them (??) but she can&#39;t figure out who her own soulmate is. but basically she meets a boy and they start hanging out and she really likes him but she knows she&#39;s not his soulmate and one day they come across the boy&#39;s soulmate and I don&#39;t remember what happens after but the cover was pink blue and purple and it was a relatively long book (over 300 pages). If someone remembers this book or something please lmk!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious-Western-3\"> /u/Suspicious-Western-3 </a> <br/> <s",

I used to be a huge reader as a tween was absolutely obsessed with the Percy Jackson series - still am. Back then, other series that really had me were the Hunger games and The Janie series by Caroline B. Cooney- The first book was the face on the milk carton.</p> <p>I got back into reading in college but I&#39;ve mainly been reading the books of show and movie adaptations all of Jenny Han books, Crazy Rich Asians series, some of the outlander books, the hating game, the flatshare, Heartstoppers, ect.</p> <p>I want a book series to obsess over. Something like PJO but a little more adult. Like an adventure/fantasy series with a romance subplot that is strong but isn&#39;t the absolute center of the story.</p> <p>A deal breaker, I am not into dark romance whatsoever. I LOVE enemies to lovers or rivals to lovers things in that realm. Violence, death, and gore I can handle, but any roughness/nonconsental behavior",
