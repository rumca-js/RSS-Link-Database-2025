I set up a few MotionEye cameras a few years ago but from what I understand, it&#39;s been deprecated. I&#39;m thinking about setting up a Frigate system at my house but all I can seem to find from the website is for the OS that monitors the feeds but not the actual individual RPi OS itself. Any reccomendations?</p> <p>As far as the actual RPi goes, POE hats for both the RPi 5 and the Zero 2W cost about the same and I&#39;m going to be 3D printing my own cases, so should I just go with an RPi 5 4GB for all of my cameras or go with the Zero 2W?

I&#39;ve written a lot of libraries for Arduino which talk to a long list of sensors and displays. The code is written in portable C and would be easy to port to the Pico SDK, but... there doesn&#39;t seem to be a coherent way to publish/share such code. Is this an oversight? Do people struggle with displays/sensors and constantly re-invent the wheel?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Extreme_Turnover_838\"> /u/Extreme_Turnover_838 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ljdsox/question_for_pico_mcu_developers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ljdsox/question_for_pico_mcu_developers/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So I built my own setup using an INA219 sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi 2040 Zero, powered separately, so it wouldn&#39;t interfere with the Pi&#39;s power line. That part works fine \u2014 I can read current and voltage without issues.</p> <p>The problem came when I tried to physically insert the INA219 between the power source and the Pi. I used a generic USB-C breakout board, but it doesn\u2019t support Power Delivery (PD). As a result, the official Raspberry Pi power supply won\u2019t deliver power \u2014 there&#39;s no PD handshake. I tried third-party chargers, but none of them could provide enough stable power to run my application reliably.</p> <p>So here\u2019s the question: is there a USB-C PCB or breakout board that passes through all pins \u2014 including CC1/CC2",
