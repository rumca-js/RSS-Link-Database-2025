I am wondering because you have the AI models able to shift through research papers and conferences at a rate way faster than humans, surely people now save a ton of time in Literature Review, which in turn should shorten PhD durations? Potentially also makes it more accessible to people? I also imagine that it would make the standard of research needed to get a PhD higher as well?

AI has hidden the gems, and passion competes by generating sloppier and sloppier content, just so it doesn\u2019t completely die out. AI is now being used to create slop\u2014to create soulless pieces of art to push out money. And that is bad. Because when you don\u2019t work for anything, you don\u2019t learn how to w",

What are you going to do now? Are you going to build apps like ChatGPT and give it to the masses. Maybe, like some people think, to gather trillions of information about peoples behaviours and thinking? If it was for me, I would have stayed under the radar. I would go on with the research until I have an AI that builds me my own T 800. Before this isn\u2019t possible, I\u2019d give a shit about sharing this valuable thing so that now everyone can play with it and maybe develop something that I didn\u2019t see before. So what do you think about the theory that this AI that we got presented today in our little apps is nothing more than something that was already there years ago - secretly moved on and developed - into something much bigger.
