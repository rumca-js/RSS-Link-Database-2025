        "description": "Over 300 million years ago, Earth experienced powerful bursts of carbon dioxide from natural sources\u2014like massive volcanic eruptions\u2014that triggered dramatic drops in ocean oxygen levels. These ancient \"carbon burps\" led to dangerous periods of ocean anoxia, which stalled marine biodiversity and potentially reshaped entire ecosystems. In a groundbreaking study, scientists combined high-tech climate models with deep-ocean sediment analysis to pinpoint five such events. The alarming part? Today's human-driven CO\u2082 emissions are skyrocketing at speeds hundreds of times faster than those ancient upheavals\u2014raising urgent questions about how modern oceans, particularly coastal zones rich in marine life, might react.",
