After a while I started to realize that I could use Gemini as my &quot;professional advisor&quot;, giving me suggestions on how to improve my resume and my Linkedin profile. I can&#39;t express how much this has helped me up till today. I still haven&#39;t found a new job, but I&#39;ve been called to more interviews ever since I started tweaking my resume. Knowing how much this was positive for me, and learning Java back then, I built a tool to analyse resumes with Artificial Inteligence. It&#39;s not sophisticated, but it gives valuable feedback. Here&#39;s the tech stack I used + the link:</p> <p>- TypeScript</p> <p>- NextJs</p> <p>- Java</p> <p>- AWS (Lambda, SES, Dynamo, SQS)</p> <p><a href=\"https://resume-refine.com/\">https://resume-refine.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UpbeatF",

About five years ago, I decided I wanted to demystify the process and make it fast. I built a flat-fee service that gives people same-day answers to their biggest architectural questions.</p> <p>I work live with the client in one focused 90-minute session. No disappearing to brainstorm for weeks. Just a real-time collaboration to solve things like:<br/> Where can I fit an extra bathroom?<br/> Can my kitchen layout be reworked?<br/> Is there space for a home office?<br/> How do I lay out a basement MIL?<br/> Where is all my storage supposed to go?</p> <p>If I have a Matterport scan, I can redesign any house from anywhere. Floorplans and photos work too, but Matterport makes it much more effective.</p> <p>I work within the existing footprint of the house to find all the home you need in the space you already have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
