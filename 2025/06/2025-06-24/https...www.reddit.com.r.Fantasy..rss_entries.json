I know this has been asked a million times, but I was recently reading A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (the compilation of the three Dunk and Egg novellas) for the Knights square of the bingo, and just realized how the view of ASOIAF has been distorted on the popular mind in the last decade or so thanks to the series and Martin not publishing Winds. Every person I see asking for recommendations based on ASOIAF wants the realism, the cruelty, the no magic-approach... and this book made me remember all the other things I liked about ASOIAF when I read it. The fable-like quality of the houses and how much weight it has on the characters (<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">the green and the rotten apples on the first novellas, the little lion on the second, and of course the million examples from ASOIAF</span>), the magic so subtle that makes you think it isn&#39;t there but actually permeates all the books and they would be totally diffe",

Overall I had fun with the book, but was left with more plot quibbles than is normal, most of which are spoilers - hence the spoiler tag on the post.</p> <p>What I enjoyed:</p> <ul> <li>Magic school from a teacher POV: This is <em>great</em>. I love this mix of magic and absolute down-to-earth practicality. I loved Magic for Liars by Sarah Gailey for the same reason, I&#39;d been wanting something like this, and it delivered. </li> <li>Professional life: fantasy tends to be bad at portraying how professional adults actually think and behave (often making even nominal adults act like eternal teenagers) and this book nailed it for me. I&#39;m not a teacher, but I believe the protagonist is a good one, in part because the aspects of work life that do translate across professions rang true. Workplace",

In response, the city\u2019s bankers concoct a desperate plan to smuggle out their wealth to a distant branch. That task falls to Cithrin, a young ward and student of the bank. This is one of the most deliciously structured fantasy novels I\u2019ve read in a while. Every character feels carefully placed to uphold the book\u2019s central tension between trade and war\u2014two forces locked in balance. The opening captures this perfectly: the Anteans may invade Vanai, but their military triumph is instantly undercut by the bankers&#39; foresight. That single act triggers a domino effect that\u2019s thrilling to follo",

It shaped politics, daily life, war, morality, family structure. The average person believed what the temple or church told them. People were deeply religious not just out of fear, but because that was the framework they had to understand life, death, suffering, fate, and community.</p> <p>But in so much fantasy fiction, religion is weirdly absent or superficial. Sure, there are gods, temples, and clerics, but they often feel like background dressing. You rarely see characters who actually live their faith, pray, do rituals, avoid taboos, or fear divine punishment. Despite the fact that gods are often literally real and active in these worlds. And somehow, even in worlds where deities walk the earth, there are still atheists or characters who just... don\u2019t care. </p> <p>For the most part, characters just go about their lives as if t",

Around this time, the infamous Sword of Truth series was also selling big (Remember, this was the 90&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s), and I absolutely adored the Richard and Kahlan stuff- I think that&#39;s part of why I endured so much of the series&#39; bullshit otherwise.</p> <p>So what does this have to do with Kushiel&#39;s Dart? Well, when asking for romance in fantasy books, this is one that often gets recommended.</p> <p>Let me be blunt in my takeaway: there absolutely is PASSION... but that passion borders more on lust rather than love and romance. If my understanding of what &quot;romantasy&quot; these days means- namely, a romance-style novel that is simply set in a fantasy world, or at least a world that isn&#39;t our own- then Kushiel&#39;s Dart is basically Romantasy.

A couple of examples of this kind of character that I enjoyed:</p> <p><em>The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice:</em> At least for the first few books, Will is juts a normal kid who does well by being observant, clever, and by training REALLY hard to get good as what he does. </p> <p><em>Spellslinger:</em> I like the fact that in this series Kellen is basically a terrible wizard who survives by cunning, bravado, and help from his friends. He gets better, but mainly through cunning. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions for other books that follow this &quot;normal person who has to work hard and be clever to make it through the story&quot; idea?

The (b)romance between Arthur and merlin is so good.
