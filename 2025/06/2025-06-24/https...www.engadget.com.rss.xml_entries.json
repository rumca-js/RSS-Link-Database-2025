On Tuesday, the company announced the Tacx Alpine, an indoor gradient simulator for its family of NEO smart trainers. The accessory can replicate inclines of up to 25 percent and declines of up to -10 percent, with adjustments made either manually through a built-in control panel or automatically when using the device with a compatible apps like Zwift and Garmin\u2019s own Tacx Training software.</p>\n<p>In those same apps, the Tacx Alpine also allows for real-time virtual steering adjustments. Naturally, Garmin Connect support is also included for stat tracking and more.
