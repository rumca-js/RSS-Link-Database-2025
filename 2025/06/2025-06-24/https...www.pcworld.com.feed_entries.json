If the answer is always \u201cmore,\u201d then you might be satiated by Samsung\u2019s OLED G9. This behemoth is 49 inches wide, essentially two 1440p displays crammed into one massive, curved panel. Normally $1,300, today Amazon is selling this monitor (new, not refurbished) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSGJRKCR\">for $899.99</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few different 49-inch Samsung monitors, but this G91SD OLED model was first launched late last year. While it\u2019s not the fastest OLED around at just 144Hz, you\u2019ll still need a beefy PC to hit that mark across 5120\u00d71440 resolution. You\u2019ll want to use a desktop PC for sure, since the USB-C port on this big fella doesn\u2019t support video or charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular model goes a little less on eBay as a refurbished or open-box unit, but this is about as good a",

The idea is that by filtering blue light, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/394952/how-to-enable-blue-light-filter-windows-better-sleep.html\">you might be able to sleep better</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1796506/how-to-tweak-windows-to-help-your-tired-eyes.html\">ease on eye strain</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you have one of those newer computers with Snapdragon chips, you won\u2019t be able to run Night Light on an external display. Why? It\u2019s due to hardware limitations in Arm-based chips. Specifically, it\u2019s \u201ca limitation of the Qualcomm Oryon chipset\u201d as confirmed by Dell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, according to <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/24/dell-says-windows-11s",

Today he\u2019s checking out the last update, which comes with a full benchmark mode to test full path tracing lighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you caught <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2777253/why-doom-the-dark-ages-feels-so-buttery-smooth.html\">Will\u2019s earlier coverage of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>, you know that micro-stutter (or a lack thereof) is a key part of the smooth movement and shooting in the game. Does turning on the intense, super-pretty path tracing lighting engine mess that up? Well\u2026a little. Running at 85-90 frames per second, you\u2019ll see microstutter of up 10-13 mi",

The 145W output is faster than most consumer-grade portable batteries, with one of the USB-C ports able to deliver up to 140W of charging power when used on its own. That\u2019s fast enough to recharge a MacBook Pro more than halfway in 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this power bank has three ports in total\u2014two USB-C and a USB-A\u2014and you can fast-charge on all three ports at once.
