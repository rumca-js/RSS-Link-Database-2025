I remembered it being good, but I had forgotten just how immersive and intense it is.</p> <p>From the very first scene the world feels completely lived in. The long takes, the grime, the handheld camera work. It doesn\u2019t feel like a movie, it feels like you\u2019re there. That car scene in the woods is still one of the most jaw-dropping sequences I\u2019ve ever seen.</p> <p>What really surprised me is how relevant it still feels. The fear, the hopelessness, the way people cling to whatever\u2019s left. It\u2019s all eerily familiar now. And yet there\u2019s something deeply human at the heart of it. That moment with the crying baby floored me.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a loud movie but it says everything it needs to. Just pure cinema.</p> <p>Curious if anyone else has revisited it recently.

The snowy landscapes, the way every shot is framed, it all feels very cinematic. The action is insanely violent but so over the top that it becomes kind of fun. There are scenes that had me laughing out loud just from how absurdly badass they were.</p> <p>The main character barely speaks but says everything with his presence. It\u2019s simple, efficient storytelling that works. If you go in expecting gritty realism you might be thrown off because it leans heavily into fantasy action territory but if you let go and enjoy the ride it\u2019s incredibly satisfying.</p> <p>Would love to hear what others thought.

Then, she quit or temporarily retired, and Jennifer Tilly got massive with Bound, Bullets Over Broadway, the Chucky movies and Liar Liar. </p> <p>It&#39;s hard to compare the two since Meg wasn&#39;t in a lot of movies but Meg definitely was the better dramatic actress. Jennifer is better at comedy. Both women got one Best Supporting Actress nom and I still think they should have won. </p> <p>I always wish they had made one movie together, though. Meg has made sporadic returns, she even wrote a script for a Hilary Swank movie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_Peartree\"> /u/PM_Peartree </a> <br/> <span><a href=",
