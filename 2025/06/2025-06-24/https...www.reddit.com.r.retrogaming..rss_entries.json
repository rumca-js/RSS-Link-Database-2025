You get a fucking sword to do combat with instead of just being able to throw apples and jump on an enemies head. Sure the SNES had better sound, but the Genesis version wasn&#39;t that far off in the sound department. Graphics are basically identical. If the SNES version has better graphics it&#39;s just by a very very very small margin. Genesis held it&#39;s own it&#39;s against the SNES with this one, something that happened quite a bit more then people tend to think. </p> <p>Another LETS ARGUE! topic I was thinking of was Robocop vs. Terminator but that&#39;s a land slide win for the Genesis due to all the uncensored gore in the Genesis port. SNES really shot themselves in the foot censoring all the gore in that game. But we&#39;re here to talk about Aladdin so let me know your thoughts on which port you think is",

Ive been wanting to do it for a while, and decided im going to start with the Sega Saturn. Here&#39;s where I am now confused.</p> <p>Since I live in the UK, naturally I would assume it would be best for me to collect PAL region consoles. Apparently its even cheaper and sometimes easier to find PAL games, though I doubt that is always true. Either way, I have only just discovered that a lot of retro PAL games run slower due to a 50/60hz difference between regions.</p> <p>This is a huge bummer, because there is no way id want to start a collection of the worse version of games if there wasnt some form of workaround. I wondered if anyone knew how easy (or if it is even possible) to somehow play these PAL games at a 60hz equivalent speed on native hardware, or if it would be smarter to just collect American instead?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
