(?) I am asking for some assistance on why that is. </p> <p>The game I tested it on is Until You Fall, running Meta Quest Link and WMR. While I was able to run the game on a similar resolution (upping the Render Resolution to 1.7x) with the Quest, the game started lagging, and my understanding is that they should run the same, since both are powered by my PC. The lag starts around 1.5x Render Resolution (3616 x 1952), which is not close to the resolution of the HP. (4 320 x 2160)</p> <p>I do understand that Meta Quest Link is not the best option, and I am planning to change to ALVR or VD, but before I start setting those up, I thought I would learn some about this stuff. So any link to articles explaining this or advice is much appreciated. </p> <p>Specs if they count:</p> <h1>MSI H81M",

Essentially is wont charge when powered off, it will show the orange light and the charging icon but wont actually go up at all. The solution is to simply not power it off, and charge it in sleep mode. I had an issue where I played until it turned off, and it got stuck in a loop of showing it was charging, but when i tried to turn it on it just showed the critically low battery symbol and wouldn&#39;t turn on. If this is your issue, hold the power button and the volume down button for 10-30 seconds, or until it shows the old looking menu. Then just tap the power button again on the &quot;boot device&quot; option, where it will turn on and be at 1%, then just let it charge. Also have it plugged in during all of this. </p> <p>Hopefully this helps someone, because it was very frustrating to deal with last night, and I couldnt find anywhere online with this issue and a solution.<",

Think spray-painting walls or sculpting in mid-air together, with the real room respected (occlusion, obstacles, etc). So far, everything I\u2019ve tried is frustratingly far from what seems like a reasonable baseline in 2025.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried:</p> <p>\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f MultiBrush (by far the biggest disappointment)</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Co-location: Basically nonexistent. There\u2019s no automatic syncing between headsets. You have to manually align the space, and if you scale the world, you\u2019re done \u2014 no way to resync or reset. \u2022 Meshing / Occlusion: Doesn\u2019t exist. So if I draw \u201cbehind\u201d a table, I still see the paint on top of it. No spatial awareness = immersion killer. \u2022 Undo button? Nope. Why? \u2022 Positive: The brushwork itself is fluid, but that\u2019s it. </code></pre> <p>\ud83c\udfa8 Figments XR</",
