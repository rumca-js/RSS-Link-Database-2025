        "description": "Elden Ring Nightreign Duchess Build - Divine Duchess (Non-Status Effect Build)\nIn this Elden Ring Nightreign video, I'm going to be showing my nonmeta Duchess build. This is a build that doesn't focus on poison or frostbite. Neither of those are in the build. The reason I created it is a lot of people need a build with Duchess that will take on the last boss, which is immune to both of those status effects, and I wanted to showcase a build that you can play even against other bosses that work really well.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Divine Duchess Build\n0:30 How this build work\n1:53 Relics\n4:57 Other Relics and Concept\n6:56 Dormant Powers and Passives\n8:19 Weapons\n9:48 Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https://www",
