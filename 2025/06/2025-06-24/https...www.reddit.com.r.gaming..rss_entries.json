I\u2019ve heard good things about the Xbox Series controller and the PS5 DualSense, but I\u2019m also curious if there are any lesser-known options that might be even better.</p> <p>What\u2019s your pick for the best PC controller in 2025? Bonus points if it\u2019s wireless and works well with Steam or Game Pass titles.</p> <p>Are there any downsides to the fancy ones like the Elite or SCUF? Or are they really worth the price for PC gaming?</p> <p>Would love to hear what you all are using and what you\u2019d recommend as the best gaming controller for PC, especially if you\u2019ve tried a few different ones.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!--",

Jak 2 and 3 both have this but only once per game. </p> <p>The second is a double whammy in final fantasy 12. In that game you have two levels after the first act and before the final act where the MC walks around a big city talking to random people to solve a puzzle to advance the story.
