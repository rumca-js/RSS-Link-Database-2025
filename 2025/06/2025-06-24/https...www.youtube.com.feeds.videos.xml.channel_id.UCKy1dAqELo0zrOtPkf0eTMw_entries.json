Especially after that Season 2 cliffhanger!\u00a0\n\nThe Korean series has been a cultural phenomenon from the jump, created by Hwang Dong-hyuk and starring Lee Jung-jae. The simple act of pitting hundreds of players against each other in an effort to pull themselves out of poverty sparked endless conversations amongst fans and across the creative world. The games, from the popular red light green light to the viral dalgona cookie, have kept fans on the edges of their seats since Squid Game Season 1.\u00a0\n\nSquid Game Season 2 kept the story going, but offered an added layer of complication that we\u2019ll avoid going into in this description for spoiler reasons. Dive into the video to learn everything you need to know before Squid Game Season 3 hits on June 27.",

Some fans like it, others don\u2019t. While 28 Years Later had a great weekend start, Pixar\u2019s Elio did not. The movie had disappointing numbers for a Pixar movie, making it the lowest performing debut that the company has had in years. \nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort.",
