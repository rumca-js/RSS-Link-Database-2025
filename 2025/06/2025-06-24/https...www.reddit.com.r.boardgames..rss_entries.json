I&#39;ve recently played and enjoyed a few games of Shikoku 1889 due to recent posts in this subreddit, and naturally I&#39;ve started researching into all the different 18XX games. One things that I&#39;ve noticed is that there&#39;s another genre of 18XX focusing on operations i.e. &quot;run good companies&quot;.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;m struggling to understand the appeal of playing a operational-style 18XX game instead of a solid heavyweight euro game. Is it simply nice to play a similar system without having to fully learn a new game and/or without having to deal with the cutthroatness of a financial-style 18XX? But, for example, why play a game of 1846 instead of maybe 2 games of Brass Lanchasire/Birmingham? I&#39;m assuming all players in this scenario are experienced at board games and euro systems, which I assume most 18XX players would be.</p> <p>Hope some folks c",
