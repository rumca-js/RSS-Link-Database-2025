Use code ECHELON at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/echelon\n\nLLM tools (like ChatGPT from OpenAI) are rapidly creating a society of idiots. While those words seem to be against the wishes of MIT researchers, their findings, and their actions in the wake of those findings, suggest a deep concern for not only the effects that LLM usage has on developing minds, but the near future actions of governments and education institutions with regards to how they are used. \n\nIn simple terms, the ChatGPT style tools that you use (like Grok, and other similar programs) make you an idiot. They erode your cognitive processes, and are especially impactful on younger developing minds. \n \n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\nTHE RESEARCH: https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/your-brain-on-chatgpt/overview/\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/suppo",
