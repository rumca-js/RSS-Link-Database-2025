For example if I see that I am already showing up for a phrase, should i double down and build more webpages and blogs with the queries incorporated into titles? Or is this backwards thinking, should I look at phrases and queries I&#39;m not showing up for very well and build content with them in mind and not worry about what I am showing up for since I&#39;m already showing up for those searches?</p> <p>I know thats a mouthful so hoping I described that right and it makes sense.

These were all being picked up by the homepage.</p> <p>Recently, those rankings dropped across the board. Service pages are still ranking well. Some even improved.
