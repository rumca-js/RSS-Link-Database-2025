A friend recommended it as a way to make a bit of extra money while traveling. The idea is pretty simple: if you\u2019ve got extra space in your luggage, you can carry small items (like cosmetics, accessories, snacks, etc.) for people at your destination and get paid for it.</p> <p>I gave it a try, delivered some tech accessories and chocolates. Everything went smoothly, and I got paid without any hassle. No shady items, and customs didn\u2019t ask anything since it was all lightweight and legit.</p> <p>It got me thinking could this model scale as a proper side project or even something to build on? Or are there just too many friction points like trust, customs, or inconsistent demand?</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts not affiliated with the app or anything, just genuinely intrigued by the concept and where it could go.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
