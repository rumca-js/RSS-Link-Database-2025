I\u2019ve always enjoyed the history of the California gold rush but most stories are about the gold seekers that got there too late and didn\u2019t hit their jackpots. This story begins in San Francisco in 1848, population 900. Rumors of gold discoveries in the hills came down to the city but by and large most residents were doubtful.

There were moments at the beginning where I thought the book was thicker than it needed to be but the farther I got into and at the moment I finished it, not a single line of this book was a chore to get through, except a certain memoir but that&#39;s too be expected. This book packs quite a few gut punches in it without feeling too overwhelming or contrived in itself, you can understand each characters motivations and realize the biggest antagonist in this book is a lack of understanding between everyone.

They are characters that speak by themselves and have a 3D shape, with their own opinion and a strong personality. The hallways twist and turn in unexpected ways. There are random, unrecognizable smells, sounds and emotions. Voices echoing down the stairs, doors that lead to strange places and unrecognizable shapes in the shadows of the corners that make you feel a certain way. And sometimes you cannot find the way out, and even when you finish the book you keep &quot;trapped&quot; inside this house, trying to figure things out. Trying to understand where all the hallways lead to and if there is an undiscovered perspective in a character you hadn&#39;t discovered. </p> <p>Other times, books that seem just as well writen, feel like a well-built house, but all the doors are just shallow closets that lead nowhere.
