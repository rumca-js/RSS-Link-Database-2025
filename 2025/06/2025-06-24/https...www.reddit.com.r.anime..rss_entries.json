I searched through MAL but found nothing close.</p> <p>Some main elements of this anime include: girl student, pixel style, school, a rabbit teacher (or other small animals), comedy.</p> <p>The girl students are in pixel style, and they transform into regular size to finish task. They need to finish tasks to graduate.</p> <p>In my limited memory, in one episode, the (rabbit?) teacher turned into a different colour, claiming that it&#39;s not (rabbit?) teacher and aims to stop the girls from graduating.</p> <p>Honestly, I have found exactly no record of the thing I described and I start to suspect that I dreamed of it and assumed it actually exists.
