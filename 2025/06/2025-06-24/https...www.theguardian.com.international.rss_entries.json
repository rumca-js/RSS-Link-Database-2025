Our aim is to highlight, via a series of subterranean dives into each football season, how it went from being a \u201ca slum sport played in slum stadiums and increasingly watched by slum people\u201d \u2013 as a Sunday Times editorial called it in 1985 \u2013 to a multi-gazillion pound industry.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/24/nessun-dorma-podca",
