I&#39;ve noticed that when i enter a search query on the native api it returns a lot of irrelevant posts. If i were to use the same search query on the actual site, the posts are more relevant. I&#39;ve tried using other scrapers and the results are as bad as the native api.</p> <p>So my question is, what&#39;s your best advice at structuring search queries to return relevant results. Is there a maximum number of words I shouldnt exceed? Should the words be as specific as possible?</p> <p>If this is just the nature of the api, how do you go about scraping as many relevant posts as possible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shoddy_Ad_9107\"> /u/Shoddy_Ad_9107 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1lbvzx3/why_does_the_native_reddit_api_su",
