Unlike temples (which have a round temporary FP token placed during setup - see rules p.4 &quot;common setup&quot; in latest rules), no Fame Point token is added to the Sanctuary during setup.

This meant that when the first player took control of the temple (in the day phase) they removed that token and added it to their FP track.

Me and my gf are going on a 2+ month campervan trip and we&#39;d like to take some great games with us so we are looking for suggestions for new games. </p> <p>Requirements: - Since space is tight in a van, we need games that are small or smallish both when put away and also when in play since table space is also limited. - The games will mostly be played in two. Bonus points if it&#39;s also good solo because I play solo as well or for higher player counts for meeting people (this is more of a nice to have). - The complexity up to somewhere around 3.0 bgg maximum. Preferred around 2.0 - 2.5 range. - Since a lot of van life is outside, it would be great if the game can take a bit of wind so a lot of cards on a table is a negative thing most of the time. - In terms of taste we enjoy 7 wonders duel, Critters at war, Sky team, Codenames, Exit series... </p> <p>I hope I gave enough information for some meaningful suggestions.

We noticed however that the river strategy seems a bit too easy to perform in relation to the amount of points it gives. Since it also fills out the board with only 1 brick per tile, it contributes to the game ending condition of filling the board at lightning speed at the same time.

All miniatures are different and you can collect them all, plus, you can choose which ones you want for the match.</p> <p>I ask this because most games I see are ultra complex, lots of rules, items, dice, lore, etc, and in this TikTok era I would love for something light, fun and collectible.</p> <p>Most players I know love long and complex games, but maybe, some players enjoy more light games?

It&#39;s a two player game simulating the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Tuscany (in case the title didn&#39;t give that away). It is also part of Volko Ruhnke&#39;s Levy &amp; Campaign series.</p> <p>The game took roughly 7h 15min and ended with a win for the Ghibellines with 10 VP vs 8.5 VP for the Guelphs. I am sure we made a few rules mistakes but these things are bound to happen for the first few plays of a game such as this.</p> <p>For anybody unaware of the L&amp;C series, it shows different medieval conflicts with a big emphasis on the logistics of medieval warfare.
