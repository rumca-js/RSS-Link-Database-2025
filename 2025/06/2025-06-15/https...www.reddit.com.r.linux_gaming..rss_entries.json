Changing FSR options doesn&#39;t alter FPS - but if I set the resolution to 1440p then it&#39;s a stable 60 FPS.</p> <p>This is on Manjaro with mesa 25, GE Proton 10-4.</p> <p>When I play the same game on Nvidia I can set the DLSS option and it <em>does</em> have an effect. Of course this is with proprietary drivers, on Ubuntu 24.04 with GE-Proton 9-25. Spoiler alert, FSR does work with my 4090!</p> <p>Is this a known issue about this game?</p> <p>Thought about using gamescope and <em>force</em> it, ",

I play all kinds of emulators such as Playstation 1 and 2 and others, various older games in Bottles/Lutris and new titles that will work on the Ryzen iGPU (only playing on iGPU). Am I gonna face any issues playing on a screen like this?</p> <p>The thing I worry the most is that these are hiDPI screens and to get better performance I will have to set the game resolution to exactly 4x less pixels, so to 1440x900 or 1440x960, so that 4 pixels correspond to 1 pixel - no loss due to imperfect scaling. These are very non standard resolutions, I worry they may not be an option or something else may be an issue.</p> <p>These are very popular laptops so and I&#39;m sure many here have a 2.8K screen, so I hope this will be easy to answer.</p> <p>PS Is 90hz supported OOB on Linux on the Thinkpad 2.8K OLEDs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",

Otherwise on both the campaign and battle layers the game runs fine. I know this isn&#39;t an issue of insufficient hardware as my system (9800X3D, 7900 XTX, 32 GB RAM) runs far more intensive games like MH Wilds with minimal issues, so it may be due to my choice of Proton or launch options. Alternatively, I have heard about the Steam Deck having memory leak issues with the game, so it could possibly be a similar issue on my own computer. Nonetheless, if anyone else has had similar experiences and managed to resolve them, your advice would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SWAZZBOOM0131\"> /u/SWAZZBOOM0131 </a> <br/> <span><",
