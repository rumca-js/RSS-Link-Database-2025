It didn&#39;t do anything and so I deleted it straight away. Nothing odd has happened since, but now I&#39;m deeping how risky a decision it was and the potential consequences. I ran malwarebytes and it says its clear but idk. Is there anything I should do to mitigate the risk other than obviously not doing stupid shit like that again. Thank you in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WindowEasy4647\"> /u/WindowEasy4647 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1lcb1xe/potentially_malicious_apk_what_do_i_do/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1lcb1xe/potentially_malicious_apk_what_do_i_do/\">[comments]</a></span>",
