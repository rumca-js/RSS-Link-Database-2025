For fun, I decided to figure out what games they were based on what little memory I have of them. I&#39;ve figured out most of them: R-Type 2, Amnios, Elf, Winter Games, Arcticfox, Mercenaries 2. But there are a couple I can&#39;t figure out on my own.</p> <p>The first may have been more of a tech demo than a game. Picture a screen from a platforming game, with multiple levels on the screen, and the environment is a beige/tan color palette. Under the platforms are some metal wheels with round slots. Balls keep spawning from the top and roll along the top platform and fall into the top slots of the wheels, which then rotates and drop them down. And that&#39;s all I can remember, I think maybe you control when the wheels rotate, but I&#39;m not sure, like I said it may just be a tech demo.</p> <p>The second one isn&#39;t a game at all, it&#39;s more of an easter egg on w",

As I&#39;m sure many know, the dimensions that he worked with on the Amiga were 320x200, using rectangular pixels.</p> <p>I recently had the tremendous honor of communicating with Mr. Sachs briefly, and he gave me permission to use any images of his that I found on the web. He asked only that I preserve the original aspect ratio while printing them.</p> <p>I&#39;m planning to pull images from the web using my PC via Google Image searches. (Unfortunately, I don&#39;t currently have a hardware Amiga.)</p> <p>Based on my understanding of this earlier Reddit thread (and let me know if I am mistaken), it sounds like the proper dimensions that I should use to maintain the aspect ratio modern monitor would actually be to resize the 320x200 images to 320x240 or 640x480:</p> <p><",
