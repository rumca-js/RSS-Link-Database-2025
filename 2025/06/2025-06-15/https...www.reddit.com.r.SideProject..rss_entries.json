Others allow uploading to FTP servers, but setting up FTP servers, storage management, handling redundancy, disk space monitoring. you become a sysadmin instead of doing work on your community.</li> </ul> <p>So I made ObsidianVault - a specialized backup solution that just works.</p> <h1>What It Does</h1> <p>Install a lightweight plugin, run <code>/backup create world</code> or <code>/backup create plugins</code> and your data is safely stored in the cloud.

No more guessing if that jacket actually fits your vibe or that dress looks WTF on you, or t shirt fits good (my case).</p> <p>\u2022 How it works <strong>-</strong> snap a pic of yourself and use the virtual fitting room to try on clothes in real-time. The app uses AR to fit the clothes on your body, letting you see how they look from different angles.<br/> \u2022 Why it\u2019s dope <strong>-</strong> aves you from returns, makes online shopping feel less sus, and gives you legit peace of mind.</p> <p>I\u2019d love for you to rate it and let me know what you think, bugs, ideas.</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zoltangoviral\"> /u/zoltangoviral </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

So, I built this thing called Risero. Basically, it&#39;s an AI helper for posting on Reddit (and soon, Discord/other stuff). The idea is you write one post, and it figures out <em>where</em> to put it and even tweaks the wording so it sounds right for each subreddit, and Saves a ton of headache trying to navigate all the rules and vibes. But here&#39;s the kicker: I used Risero <em>to market itself</em>. Like, seriously... Threw up just two posts using it, barely touched a thing, and boom \u2013 21 signups in 48 hours... Kinda blew my mind, tbh... Hopefully that number&#39;s even higher by the time you&#39;re reading this. I mean, it&#39;s pretty neat because it handles the annoying bits: figuring out the best subreddits for your post (and actually checking the rules, thank god), then it kinda rewrites your message to fit that community&#39;s t",
