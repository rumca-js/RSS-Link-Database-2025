So what I don\u2019t want is someone(s) coming along with more time and resources than me to simply fork and make it closed source and sell. AGLPv3 would help me with this concern. </p> <p>Now the issue with AGLPv3 is companies then won\u2019t touch it. I want companies to be able to integrate it into their company. So I want to offer a dual license AGPLv3 + commercial license. But I understand if I were to offer a commercial license with AGPLv3, then I must also attach a CLA to any contributors. Which I know is controversial. </p> <p>What do you guys think of this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zZurf\"> /u/zZurf </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1lc",
