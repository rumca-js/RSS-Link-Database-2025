I do believe I have feminine features and I like to wear crop tops, skirts, but also pants. For me, no rules, wearing whatever makes me happy. Recently at raves and parties guys would flirt with me, hug me from behind and then act rude or completely shaken when they realize I am actually a boy. Should I write it in my face? I am not even trans, or should I tell every guy who shows interest that I am not a girl?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently discovered that someone I follow on Instagram (not close friends, just a former coworker I met once in a social setting before we worked for the same company) is a MAGA gay. He follows and occasionally likes some of 45/47\u2019s posts. He\u2019s a white gay man in his thirties who is wealthy, has a husband, is friends with all of the \u2018hot\u2019 white gays where he lives, and he has a supportive family. We both grew up in conservative religious (Mormon) homes, so I\u2019m guessing he hasn\u2019t deconstructed his political beliefs.</p> <p>I saw him post on his IG stories that he was in New York with his husband. One of the stories was a playbill and the stage of \u2018Oh, Mary!\u2019 I don\u2019t know why, but for some reason I felt very annoyed and it made me think about other MAGA gays who seem to like the benefits and some aspects of participating in \u2018the culture,\u2019 but simultaneously support presidents/parties who actively fight to take away LGBT+ rights.</p> <p>AITA for wantin",
