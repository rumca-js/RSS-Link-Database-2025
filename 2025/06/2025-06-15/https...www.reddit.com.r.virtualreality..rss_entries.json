One of the highest one is htc vive pro 2 and they have pretty good deal for 860 eur till june 30, but many people say that they are out dated and thay cam be true because they was are released in 2021..</p> <p>My next options is valve index and pimax but i dont have a clue which one is better. Because i was always user of quest since quest 2, now have quest 3.</p> <p>What can you guys recommend for best option for price that is not astronomical. I understand that we speaking about 000 zone, but i wish that first digit wont go beyond 1. Is it possible? Maybe i will find something used. And i also sell my quest 3 so i will add a bit (around 400). </p> ",
