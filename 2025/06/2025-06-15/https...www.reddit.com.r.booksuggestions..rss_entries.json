I ask because I know Amazon sometime delivers books a little beat up or torn. Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s worth the extra $10 at B&amp;B.

I\u2019m heading to Japan for three weeks this summer and I\u2019m on the lookout for a long romance book to keep me busy while I\u2019m there. I\u2019m open to pretty much any theme or trope, but some of my favorites are dark romance, sports romance, cowboy romance, and enemies to lovers. That said, I\u2019m definitely open to suggestions outside those genres too!</p> <p>What I\u2019m really looking for is something lengthy\u2014ideally 400ish pages or more\u2014so I can really get lost in the story and characters. I love books with strong emotional arcs, great chemistry, and engaging plots.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations for long, immersive romances that fit the bill (or even surprise me with something new), I\u2019d really appreciate it! Thanks so much in advance\u2014can\u2019t wait to hear your recs and get reading on my trip!!!

I want the kind of whimsical where the FMC is a fae or elf or something, where she walks barefoot in forests, is connected to nature. I\u2019d prefer if the love interest is obsessed w her (but like it can be enemies to lovers).</p> <p>Also, I recently watched H2O: Just Add Water (a childhood fav of mine) and I was wondering if anyone had mermaid recs \u2014 like scenes of the FMC running and diving into the water, descriptive moments of her swimming through the water. Idek. </p> <p>Any recommendations would be appreciated \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aelin_fireheart2234\"> /u/aelin_fireheart2234 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lc79oo/whimsical_romantasy_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggesti",

The MC can tell that something is very off as the people appear to be performing like a 1950s Americana sitcom, housewives cooking dinner and people opening their shops but it&#39;s obvious something strange is happening in the town, such as how there is a wall around it and he can&#39;t seem to leave etc. When he asks about it, he basically gets non-answers or it&#39;s like they&#39;re being watched.</p> <p>A similar vibe I can think of is the way the characters say &quot;doesn&#39;t look like anything to me&quot; in the Westworld TV show when presented with information that suggests something strange is going on.</p> <p>I&#39;m just really looking for that &quot;what the hell is going on here and why won&#39;t anyone acknowledge it&q",

Only answer if you&#39;ve read through the post and understand my point.</strong></p> <p>My memory is shitty and it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been actively reading, but back when I was reading through the whole riftwar saga I remember being fascinated by it, it started out feeling a bit like a kids book then it got more and more epic and serious. If my memory serves there were challenges and big bads but the atmosphere was generally upbeat throughout.</p> <p>As a stark contrast, I&#39;ve read through the Wheel of Time series too, and I remember hating the atmosphere. I loved the plot and the epic battles but I only finished reading the series because I had to know how it ends even though I hated it.

I just finished Bill Bryson \u2018a short history of nearly everything\u2019. I\u2019m obsessed with learning as much random but important (relatively), interesting stuff so this was a great start. Was wondering what others you guys would suggest? I\u2019m thinking of doing Hawkins A brief history of Time or maybe Sapiens. Would love some suggestions! Also was thinking something Einstein but I fear his actual work may be a bit too intense to follow clearly. That may have to be a YouTube video job haha.

It talks about how inner eulogy values (Values that talk about personality instead of selfish external values) are more important and that humbleness is the most important part of building character. Throughout the book it talks about 8 different figures and how they developed character throughout their lives. I thought the writing was interesting but repititive and boring at parts. However the problem came in the last chapter. This chapter was a summary for the book and talked mostly about the transition from the little me cultures of the 1950s and before to the Big Me culture 1960s to the present. Brooks talks how he feels that the transition was a downgrade of society.</p> <p>He talks about how the ideas of self love and pursuing individual dreams is something to avoid and that you should pursue things that can help others.

I love a story where the main character gains some sort of fantastical affliction and has to somehow deal with it whilst either pulling through or giving in. I love something that can get dark. I love a good story with unique world building. I don\u2019t mind anything mature as long as it isn\u2019t just 100% graphic smut. </p> <p>On the other hand, I\u2019d rather like to avoid books that center on romance. I don\u2019t dislike romance, but if the plot is eventually consumed by the romance I won\u2019t be into it. I once read a book where the main protagonist was a very intelligent and independent individual. But upon meeting her love interest, who she couldn\u2019t use her special main character powers without, she became this mess who couldn\u2019t do anything without being in his ",

For those who haven&#39;t read, it is non-fiction, written by a journalist who, from wikipedia, put together a &quot;collage of interviews&quot; of women who served in the Soviet army during WWII. It has been a few years since I read it but from memory some of the stories from the women are less than a page, others span several pages. I think there are pieces of interviews from 200 women in the book.</p> <p>Are there other books like this?
