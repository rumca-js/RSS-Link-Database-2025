Many initiatives, fueled by the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), appear to pursue a leapfrogging approach to AGI and &quot;world models&quot; without sufficiently delving into the intricacies of brain science and the foundational role of consciousness. This essay argues that a more robust and sustainable path to AGI necessitates a return to biomimicry, by deeply understanding consciousness as an evolutionary outcome and by designing AI systems that experience evolutionary pressure. The Evolutionary Roots of Intelligence and Consciousness To truly advance AGI, we must first confront the nature of consciousness. All animals possess some form of consciousness, and human intelligence, particularly our higher cognitive functions, is a direct result of evolutionary pressures. Our ancestors dev",

I find this notion profoundly misguided.</p> <p>This idea that creativity must spring from nothing is a romantic myth. Every creator, every artist, every thinker is part of a grand tradition of taking, filtering, mixing, and remixing the concepts of the past. There is nothing new under the sun; this was said in Rome in the time of Plautus, whose comedies were themselves clever reworkings of older Greek stories. Every new thing is born from something that came before. Think of philosophy; how many have said something entirely &quot;original&quot; after Plato and Aristotle?
