I thought this is the best place to get an advice on this, hope you can help with a direction. </p> <p>I&#39;m lost a bit at the moment as I researched the topic. Current options seem to be: 1) cloudflare tunneling, easy to setup but I&#39;ve read that privacy as an issue 2) pangolin on public VPS, still easy to setup, but people are wary since this is new and open source direction not yet clear. I think privacy is better here, though I&#39;m sure they have some cooked in telemetry. And as well VPS provider might snoop at your data, Technically speaking 3) tailscale + VPS, same as 2 as I understand. Though tailscale seems to have been around for longer. </p> <p>Any other suggestions? I don&#39;t mind for a higher complexity in exchange for more privacy, as my webhook payloads will post some financial data, and I&#39;m not comfortable just completely disregarding the privacy aspect. so if you can share what you do for this scenario, that",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve set up some services in Docker containers (Portainer, Nextcloud, HomeAssistant, Immich, and Technitium) and set up Tailscale on all my devices. Now, I can access all my services via Tailscale, but obviously only via HTTP when I choose to access from the browser. For Nextcloud AIO, I followed the setup using Caddy as a sidecar (<a href=\"https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439\">https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/5439</a>) which works well. Now I wanted to explore using Caddy as a sidecar for my other services (mainly by failing to adapt the docker-compose.yml and Caddyfile) without success while managing to break my Nextcloud access via Tailscale domain in the process. Defeated, I come here for help. Is there a more idiot-proof way to achieve this or some more guidance? </p> <p>Many thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Velcorn\"> /u/Velcorn </a",
