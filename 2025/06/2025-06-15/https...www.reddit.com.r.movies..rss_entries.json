I\u2019m thinking about it now, you can say it was the peer pressure, he mentions that he\u2019d never be able to walk around the neighborhood, that he\u2019d be looked out as a mutt, chicken, punk, but in reality, he was essentially Sonny\u2019s son or at least he was tight with Sonny. Sonny had the most respect in the neighborhood &amp; he was feared, so I think his logic while he was in the car sort of didn\u2019t make too much sense, but I\u2019m noticing it now lol.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the ending as it is, where he walks out and we get nothing else, is perfect. The ending I remembered wasn&#39;t nearly as good, but I&#39;m struggling to figure out why I have such a vivid memory of a different ending scene.</p> <p>I remember a scene after Truman has left, where he is with Sylvia, and they are watching TV. The TV reveals that a reboot to the Truman Show has started, this time with a little girl as the main character, and Marlon is playing her father. Truman and Sylvia shake their heads and turn off the TV, and *that&#39;s* when it goes to credits.</p> <p>Does anyone know where I might have seen this? Was it some fan-made thing, a post-hoc scene for something else that was referencing TTS, a deleted scene I can&#39;t find, or did I straight up hallucinate this ending?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

To me the characters of Leroy and Montgomery had the best character development. The film also does a really good job with the music.
