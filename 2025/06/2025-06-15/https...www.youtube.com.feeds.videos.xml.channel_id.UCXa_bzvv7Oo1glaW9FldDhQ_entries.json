        "description": "Developing a game can be a really tricky job. Video games take a lot of time and effort to make, and there are a lot of moving parts involved in the process. While it\u2019s majorly clear what makes a game tick, sometimes it happens that developers make worse decisions and develop something that isn\u2019t innovative in the slightest. \n\nIt can occur due to a disconnect between what the fan base expects and what the developer delivers, or maybe iterating without innovation, or maybe just a poor development cycle. \n\nWith this video, we will be taking a look at 15 such cases of games where the developers actually ended up \u201cmaking it worse\u201d!",

        "description": "For numerous reasons, player perception of games prior to even a minute\u2019s play can be damning. This isn\u2019t a video on how you should all give Marathon a chance though, no. Instead, we\u2019re aiming to highlight games that visually might look unimpressive, or mechanically may appear shallow, or conceptually or thematically might seem repetitive or over-explored. \n\nThe games featured here harbour more beneath their presentation. Furthermore, they\u2019ve delighted legions of fans \u2013 some of which into the millions \u2013 via their innovative gameplay, engrossing stories, wonderful characters, inventive mechanics, or a combination of them all. \n\nTo bottom line: first impressions can be deceiving, and it\u2019s in playing these games that their true power comes to the fore beyond what they initially appear to be about.",
