The congress gets quickly derailed by various skirmishes involving government officials, rebels, and attendees of other conventions being hosted in the same hotel. The solution to quelling the riot? Spiking the hotel&#39;s tap water with a drug of course!

(no spoilers) I couldn&#39;t say that I walked away with the mind-blown feeling the author wanted me to experience, rather more of a feeling that I read the cliff notes version. All info, none of the fun that comes when the twists land. Don&#39;t know how people listen to a massive series like Lotr, stormlight, or asoiaf and understand a lot of what is happening in a satisfying way. Simple ones, sure. I do like to listen to the audiobooks after I finish reading the text as to enjoy the narrator performances, but I rarely pick up more story morsels than I did the first time like I would on a reread.

I liked the irreverent tone, the lighthearted take on the fantasy world, and the main characters. But the overarching story didn\u2019t really do it for me. It seemed basically like the literary equivalent of a road trip movie (maybe there\u2019s a better term) where the overarching story is pretty slim and it\u2019s really just an excuse for a series of unrelated things to happen. In the end, I found myself not really caring about what was going on, as most of what happened was just so fleeting. But since this is the first book in a large body of work, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s just on the weaker side for being the first?

If my memory serves there were challenges and big bads but the atmosphere was generally upbeat throughout.</p> <p>As a stark contrast, I&#39;ve read through the Wheel of time series too, and I remember hating the atmosphere. I loved the plot and the epic battles but I only finished reading the series because I had to know how it ends even though I hated it. It was dark, everything was depressing, hope seemed to be lost ",

Dr Saffy Walden is an alumni of Chetwood Academy, where she now teaches, and her career is her life. We follow her as she goes about her job, battles arcane invasions, deals with her troubled past and has a metaphysical mid-life crisis about who she really is.
