To me, it\u2019s obvious that this game is being pushed as a gamepass game, as more potential risks come about to buying these games, especially at launch. I think it\u2019s a microcosm of not just the elimination of physical games, but the elimination of you actually owning your game in general, as physical standalone games become more expensive and broken, and everything shifts more towards subscriptions, with companies being able to take your game away whenever they want, making actual renting of a game harder to do. </p> <p>To me, this makes services like GameFly more valuable and the common response I see regarding GameFly is how many people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s still around as a service. So I\u2019m using this platform to inform others not because I\u2019m sponsored by them because I\u2019m not, but because I think it\u2019s a genuinely useful service. </p",
