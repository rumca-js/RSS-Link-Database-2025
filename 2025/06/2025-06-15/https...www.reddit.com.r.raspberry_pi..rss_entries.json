It receives messages from telegram and displays them. and in the case of video, plays them back. I can see it being a power hungry project, with a 7 inch touchscreen display, and a decent speaker for quality playback. It&#39;s also doing double duty as a retro gaming box, and I want to be able to power it via batteries so it&#39;s at least somewhat portable. I&#39;ve looked into several audio amp hats but I&#39;m getting stuck on how best to power the pi, and the amp with a power module that also charges the batteries. Has anyone worked on a project with similar needs that could provide some insight?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bilbosmoped\"> /u/bilbosmoped </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1lbzz94/pairing_an_audio_amp_hat_with_a_battery_capable/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
