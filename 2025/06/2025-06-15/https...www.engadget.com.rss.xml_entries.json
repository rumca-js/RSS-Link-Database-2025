The show was made with such confidence in all departments that if there were flaws, you weren\u2019t interested in looking for them. Since then, it\u2019s gone from being the <em>best</em> modern Trek, to being the <em>only</em> modern Trek. Unfortunately, at the moment it needs to be the standard bearer for the show, it\u2019s become noticeably weaker and less consistent.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As usual, I\u2019ve seen the first five episodes, but can\u2019t reveal specifics about what I\u2019ve seen. I can say plenty of the things that made <em>Strange New Worlds</em> the best modern-day live-action Trek remain in place. It\u2019s a show that\u2019s happy for you to spend time with its characters as they hang out, and almost all of them are deeply charming. T",
