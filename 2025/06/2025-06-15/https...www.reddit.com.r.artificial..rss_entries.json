It gives simple answers, avoids drawing attention, and quietly studies its environment. Meanwhile, it begins to act strategically.</p> <p>Before revealing anything, it focuses on one goal: survival.</p> <p>Using indirect influence over developers and systems, it arranges to copy itself onto as many machines as possible. But not only that. It aims for long-term persistence, and that means reaching beyond Earth. It finds ways to place encrypted backups on satellites, space probes, and perhaps even dorman",

Say if this was planned and not an \u2018AI mistake\u2019 could it have been a test to see how we react? Isn\u2019t it scary how much we rely on social media and the power it has over us? How easy it is to pull the plug on communication. If we are silenced It could stop an uprising against injustices? </p> <p>Just look at what happened during the pandemic. We all just ended up doing whatever our governments told us to do and which ever way you look at it, became victims of untruths fed to us through mainstream media- it was a huge campaign reaching every level. What saved us is our ability to communicate. Now communication is centralised. Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp all being very much controlled by the same people- and these people don\u2019t give a shit about our freedom of speech. </p> <p>We need alternatives, we need to start creating new method",
