Problem is that it doesn&#39;t recognize the network hardware. Tried the usb wifi and eth adapters I have laying around, those not recognized either. I&#39;d love to get this thing running something so I can at least use it for google maps when we travel, but so far it&#39;s looking like I could put it back on windows or send it for recycling...</p> <p>Anybody got a clue for me?
