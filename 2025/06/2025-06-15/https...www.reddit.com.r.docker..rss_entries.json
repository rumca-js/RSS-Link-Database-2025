I noticed that certbot failed to renew certs recently and eventually nailed it down to the container not being able to perform any domain lookups. Any container running on the raspberry pi seems to have the same issue, but the pi itself does not seem to have any issues with lookups. Anyway the PiHole instance running on the same pi still works fine as far as I can tell, but PiHole would use the configured DNS servers anyway, hence this does not really count. Containers on the other host don&#39;t have any issues with lookups.</p> <p>I restarted the containers as well as the host, just in case, but to no avail. It seems to me as if the network configu",
