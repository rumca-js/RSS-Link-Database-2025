Is there a way to kind of work backwards from a larger category to find the most popular keywords? I&#39;ve used keyword search tools to check on search volume and competition of specific keywords, but I only have seen this broad category search in Google&#39;s trends email. I want to see the most search health topics and then also check for the most searched for words within several categories like women&#39;s health, brain health, and pelvic health. Is that possible?

My brand dropped to 30 and then to 70, and there is absolutely, and I mean absolutely, no tail to my posts in the SERP. However, they were achieving good rankings in the first week. My new posts are being indexed, and I have not received any messages or warnings from Google, nor have I been subject to any manual actions or penalties (that I&#39;m aware of). I have only 13 backlinks. They are all good-quality backlinks mostly from websites like Medium.</p> <p>So my question is, What the ",
