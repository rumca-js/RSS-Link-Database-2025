Both are extremely prominent and influential figures in the American hate group movements. According to Black&#39;s memoir they- Duke, her dad, and herself- played a pivotal role in strategically re-branding the various hate groups from hateful fear mongering and violence, to a more civil and intellectual discourse around an ideology to make it more palatable to the general public. </p> <p>Adrianne gained national attention (outside of hate groups and their watchers) shortly after Trump&#39;s first election because of the Washington Posts journalist, Eli Saslow, who first wrote an article, ",

We sometimes think of books as being objectively great/good/bad, but it&#39;s the interaction with each reader that matters. </p> <p>The book was great for Me Minus 20, mediocre for Me Now.
