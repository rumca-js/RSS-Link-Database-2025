I feel I need to understand the red team side a little more cause that\u2019s my weak spot right now. I also feel this would help me understand attacks a bit more. I\u2019m leaning towards eJPT, then moving to the CCD afterwards to further improve in Blue Team. What do you guys think? I know there are a lot of experienced security professionals in here and I would love your feedback. Right now I\u2019m a cybersecurity analyst for a local government but I want to get a new job in either a SOC Analyst or Security Analyst type roles. I want to definitely stand out in this crazy job market as well as be ready for the next role.
