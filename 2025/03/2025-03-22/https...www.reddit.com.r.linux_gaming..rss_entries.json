I tried to look for some solutions online, but so far I could not find a thing. I am wondering if any of redditors uses this controller under linux, or have any suggestions what I can try to make it work?</p> <p>Many thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/strategos81\"> /u/strategos81 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jhiwli/turtle_beach_stealth_ultra_controller/\">[link",

I&#39;ve been told that the problem is that my Graphics card is bad, but what I don&#39;t understand is why is it that it used to run so smoothly, Why is it that now the graphics card runs so slowly.
