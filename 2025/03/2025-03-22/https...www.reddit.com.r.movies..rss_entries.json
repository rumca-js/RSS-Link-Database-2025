This is instead the story of us making our machines human enough that we just use it as an excuse to treat them as how we already treat ourselves (which is like shit).

Watching Soylent Green (1973) was a long overdue, but how that went from futuristic antiutopia (2022, lol) to classic noirs is a mystery to myself. Namely, Double Indemnity (1944) And, well, by the end of this I discovered something bizarre. What do those two films that are three decades apart have in common? Yeah, I know, the title spoiled it, but still. By pure coincidence the two movies I spontaneously decided to watch share an actor, Edward G. Robinson. And, well... He&#39;s great</p> <p>Soylent Green doesn&#39;t really give his character a lot of screentime, but when it does - he did his part perfectly. To me he selled the idea of a man crying over a cut of true natural beef. Not because he got it and he&#39;s happy, but rather because the world went down so bad it&#39;s even a problem to get some meat in the first place</p> <p>And then there&#39;s Double Indemnity.
