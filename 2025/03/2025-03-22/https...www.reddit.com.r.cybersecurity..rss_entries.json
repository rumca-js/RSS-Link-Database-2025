I checked the email filter and it blocked it because it failed DKIM. I checked the domain on MXtoolbox and they had no DKIM records. Spf passes and they did not have a DMARC policy. Due to recent breaches in customer companies sending phishing emails to ours, our current policy is strictly enforced, and without exception, to quarantine all DKIM failing/missing emails. I let the salesperson know and asked if they wanted me to reach out to see if I could help them fix the issue. It was a potential whale according to him that he needed to land so he said yes. As far as I am aware, there is not a good reason to not have DKIM unless you are changing the email in transit. I don&#39;t know of any non-nefarious reason you wouldn&#39;t have it.
