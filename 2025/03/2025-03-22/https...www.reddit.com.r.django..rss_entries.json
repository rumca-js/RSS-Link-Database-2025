I&#39;m a senior engineer who specializes in web development. I mainly use Django, React and PostgreSQL as well as Docker with a few other components to build web applications and small services. I have 8 years of experience in the industry and I&#39;m looking for a new role due to a cultural shift (as best I can describe it). Unfortunately, I&#39;m not sure where to look. I&#39;ve only ever had one job and not many I know work in same field &amp; tech stack. I was hoping some of you could point me in the right direction. I&#39;ve tried LinkedIn but it seem hard to find Django jobs specifically. How do you all find jobs?
