In some cases, though, they get cancelled after a trailer has already been made public. So, we pulled together some trailers for games that never came out, whether due to cancellation, studio closure, a massive rebranding, or because they\u2019re still supposedly in development. From infamous unreleased games like Blizzard\u2019s Starcraft Ghost and Ubisoft\u2019s Beyond Good & Evil 2, to games that didn\u2019t resemble their original trailers at all, like Duke Nukem Forever or Bethesda\u2019s original Prey 2, which had nothing to do with the eventual Prey sequel developed by Arkane Austin. We delve into some of the many licensed games that got teased prior to cancellation, like Marvel Chaos, THQ\u2019s Avengers game, Star Wars 1313 and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings. While we did eventually get a few of the games on this list",
