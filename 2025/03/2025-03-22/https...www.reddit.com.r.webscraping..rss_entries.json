It is not considering each visit as a new visit. </p> <p>I checked for other fingerprint rotation plugins and could not find anything. Camoufox is not suitable for JavaScript it seems. Although it can be used with Playwright, many people report issues with clicking buttons, etc. Plus I am working on a node.js app, so not sure if it would play well.
