Clicking the DLC title on the title screen of the game did not teach you how to start it (I believe the PS version can show the details when you interact with it ?). Also, on the Steam page, it seems the DLC is still protected by D (a mistake of theirs?). Anyway, I think it should be easy and direct to trigger the DLC, but it just doesn&#39;t happen.
