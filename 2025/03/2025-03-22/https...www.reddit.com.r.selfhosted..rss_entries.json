Have gitea and simple workflow that when i change image version in the repo of compose files it stops and starts that service pulling new image. I do this manually of course do not like automatic updates. Since 5 days ago it always fails and brings down all of my containers. I started upgrading manually but sometimes when pulling new images finish it gives EOF error and all of my containers go to Exit status everything stops working. It&#39;s so frustrating. I deleted all of my images uninstalled docker deleted it&#39;s root dir. (I use bind mounts for my data) And started from scratch. Exact same problem.

I&#39;m fairly Linux savvy, have no problem with standard desktop distros.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked at Unraid, but don&#39;t love the idea of having to boot from a flash drive. I&#39;ve looked at TrueNAS, but I&#39;m not clear on CORE vs SCALE and the possibility of bugs due to Scale not being stable?</p> <p>Basically I&#39;m looking for something as simple as possible, so once I get it up and running I don&#39;t have to spend much time fiddling with the damn thing.</p> <p>Is jumping into TrueNAS the best way to go? Or can I get away with any old Debain or Ubuntu-based distro, with or without Docker on top?</p> <p>Any advice is appreciated.</p> <p>Hardware - HP elitedesk 800 G4 sff, 32GB RAM, i5-8500, 2x 12TB storage</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
