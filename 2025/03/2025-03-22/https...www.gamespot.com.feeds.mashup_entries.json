Minecraft is adding downloadable content from the film, as well as a live event and even a free skins pack so you can look like the movie's characters.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The live event transports you to a custom Minecraft realm that is the home of Midport Village, where you interact with the movie's characters, going on missions and earning exclusive loot for use in the game. The event features voiceover from Jack Black, who plays Steve in the film, and sees the user teaming with the characters played by Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, and Sebastian Hansen to play through a series of minigames.

With the latest Minecraft Live event, we now know what 2025's first game drop, Spring Into Life, contains. Get ready for a bunch of animal variants and some really cool new plants being added.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Starting with plants, players are getting something they've wanted for quite a while. After first being teased a number of years ago, firefly bushes are being added to the game. The bushes will grow in swampy biomes and near water, offering the twinkling lights of fireflies to add a little brightness to the night. Additionally, per Mojang, you'll be able to place the bushes, which are plant blocks, underneath other blocks to make your builds shine.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Other plant-based additions:</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-first-game-drop-of-2025-brings-animal-variants-and-new-plants/1100-65302",

If you've been playing Minecraft long enough and have been to The End, that might not sound all too valuable while you whip around the map with your elytra wings. However, for newer players, the process of getting a happy ghast begins in the Nether--a location you visit long before you venture into The End. That brings flight to users much",

The move allowed creators, modders, and the like to turn the block worlds they build into visually stunning landscapes. However, in that time, there has seemingly been little forward momentum in terms of officially created visual improvements. Now, though, Mojang has taken things one step further with the newly announced Vibrant Visuals update.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">GameSpot recently visited Mojang's Sweden-based studio to test the new update, and it's not hyperbole to say Vibrant Visuals is a game-changer for the 14-year-old title. And it's not just for those with PCs that support ray tracing. When Vibrant Visuals launches for Minecraft Bedrock, it'll also be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and some iOS and Android devices. And for those that play Java Edition, Vibrant Visuals is also in the works for that platform.</p><p dir=\"lt",
