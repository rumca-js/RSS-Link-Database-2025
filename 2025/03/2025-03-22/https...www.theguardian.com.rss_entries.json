Ministers have spent the past week arguing that these cuts do not technically constitute austerity because they will not be as deep as some of those made during the Conservative years. However, what label you put on these cuts matters far less than their impact.

As part of my ongoing mission to use up every part of any vegetable, I dehydrated some celeriac leaves to use as a garnish for a savoury cheese and mushroom porridge (see next week\u2019s column), and was astounded by their rich, umami flavour. It was then that I realised they could be ground with sea salt to make that old kitchen staple, celery salt. Celery salt can be used to replace regular table salt and as a flavour enhancer for just about any savoury dish, from soup to salad; it\u2019s also delicious as a seasoning for meat or fish and, of course, makes a sublimely savoury bloody mary.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/22/how-to-turn-excess-celery-leaves-into-celery-salt-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\">Continue reading...</a>",
