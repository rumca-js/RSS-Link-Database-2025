And it has become my favorite work by Philip and while others may disagree. I believe A Time Of Dragons is a superior series to Echoes and an incredible take on the chosen one and Dark Ones. </p> <p>With it being book 2 I can&#39;t dive too much into it because this isn&#39;t a spoiler review but man.. reveals on top of reveals!!! This is also Philip&#39;s longest book but his writing is such that you will read 200 pages or more without even realizing it because you just want to read more . </p> <p>None of the POVs are boring or makes you want to skim through them to read the ones you want.

There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s stuck around this long. But it\u2019s also kind of the default at this point, and because of that, it sometimes ends up feeling more like a pastiche of tropes than a living, breathing world.</p> <p>What has been fascinating me as of lately is how some creators are breaking that mold by grounding their settings in other kinds of historical inspiration. A standout example for me is Disco Elysium. That game doesn\u2019t just pull from medieval or ancient myth\u2014it twists early 20th-century ideologies, revolutionary politics, decaying modernity, and blends them into a deeply weird, deeply human setting.

Now I&#39;m looking to get immersed in the theme before the game starts and thus looking for suggestions for things to read. Bonus points if the book has a large nautical theme or a lot of sailing involved since it&#39;s going to be an age of sail game. I would also accept just high fantasy age of sail suggestions as well.</p> <p>So far, I found Frostgrave: Second Chances as something that seems like I would enjoy reading, albeit it lacks the sailing focus. </p> <p>I love all the Discworld novels, Gideon The Ninth, Mistborn, The Divine Cities, Codex Alera, Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, and of course LoTR. My favorite book is The Traitor Baru Cormorant. I hate Wheel of Time. </p> <p>TL;DR - Looking for age of sail treasure hunts but with wizards</p> <p>Thanks for any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
