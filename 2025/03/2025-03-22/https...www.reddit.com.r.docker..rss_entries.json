I tried multiple OS like Alpine, Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04 and Rocky 9 - everywhere the same behaviour.</p> <ul> <li>Compose stacks (approx. 15 with each 2-3 containers) initially (after very first OS setup and Docker installation) come up pretty fast, as it should be, but then stuck in stopping/starting (done manually, off course). The job gets done, but it takes 10min or so per container.</li> <li>Docker CLI often takes 10-20 seconds to respond.</li> </ul> <p>The base OS is naked beside Docker daemon. Strange thing is, this weird behaviour was not always the case, it just came up the last weeks or so.
