I&#39;m looking to move away from Spotify because of this, their latest experimental version 9.0.30.242 doesn&#39;t work with Android auto. I would like help knowing what is a good alternative out there, because to my understanding pirated Yt music requires root right? so id appreciate if you could direct me to which alternative you suggest and a trusted place to download it \ud83d\ude4f thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RLHO8\"> /u/RLHO8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jhksjr/alternative_to_spotify_with_android_auto_without/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jhksjr/alternative_to_spotify_with_android_auto_without/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However, they have had issues recently where when you follow the links to get to the magnet, the last page is not loading and is only white. This issue happened for a while (multiple weeks), but was finally resolved a week or so ago. However, it is happening again. You can still use the site to search for torrents and they come up, but the magnet link will not load. Does anyone know why this is happening?</p> <p>And also, I&#39;m curious if anyone happens to know the sites it aggregates from. Like I said, you can still search on the site and I&#39;m looking for a particular file that shows a well seeded copy of the torrent, but the magnet link won&#39;t load and I can&#39;t seem to find the site where it originates from and I have no idea where BT4G is pulling its results from for the most part. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",
