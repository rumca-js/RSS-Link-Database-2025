The last time I was into VR was around a year and a half ago, when me and some friends got really into Pavlov Shack. I currently own a Quest 2, and VR is something I&#39;d like to jump back into, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worth it. I haven&#39;t seen a ton of good new releases in terms of VR gaming, but I also haven&#39;t been in that circle for a while, so I might be missing something. For context, I&#39;m really only into the gaming aspect of VR, social and productive apps aren&#39;t something I&#39;m looking for in VR. I want to get a new headset, but I don&#39;t have the type of disposable income for, like, a $2,000 headset. I make around $100 in disposable income every week, so I&#39;d like to buy something in the $400-700 range if at all possible. The Quest 3 looks promising, but I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s enough good games to warrant upgrading to a new",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m counting days for my MeganeX Superlight 8K preorder (4K per eye, yes please!), and I\u2019ve been geeking out on binocular overlap, FOV and optics. I used to think wider FOV was the holy grail, but I\u2019m rethinking it: stereo overlap across the nose is where true immersion hides, and the industry\u2019s seems to be missing it. </p> <p>Take the MeganeX ~100\u00b0 horizontal FOV, and here\u2019s the kicker: nearly all of it (90-100\u00b0) is binocular overlap. No monocular flatlands like Pimax (140\u00b0 total, 100\u00b0 stereo) or Quest 3 (104\u00b0 total, 90\u00b0 stereo). It\u2019s pure 3D depth, edge-to-edge, maxing out what dual-display headsets can do. I saw some X post griping it\u2019s \u201clow FOV\u201d. MeganeX is king for stereo FOV. It\u2019s as good as it gets for 3D immersion right now\u2014human vision\u2019s ~120\u00b0 overlap is in sight, but that nose gap holds it back. </p> <p>Here\u2019s the rub: ~100\u00b0 stereo is the ceiling without a paradigm shift. Human vision gets ~120\u00b0 binocular overlap because our eyes see across",
