Follow today\u2019s news live</p><p>The Coalition has immediately matched the $150 energy bill rebate to be included in Labor\u2019s pre-election budget on Tuesday.</p><p>In an interview on Sky News on Sunday, the shadow finance minister, <strong>Jane Hume</strong>, said:</p><p><em>The Coalition will not stand in the way of much-needed energy relief from these high electricity prices, high gas prices that are caused by Labor\u2019s failed policies.</em></p><p>What we\u2019ve seen is that in 2024 power prices fell 25.2%. They would have fallen just 1.6% without rebate. So this is energy bill relief, cost-of-living support that will also have an effect of putting downward pressure on inflation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/23/australia-news-live-labor-energy-bills-rebate-cost-of-living-coalition-peter-dutton-greens-us-funding\">Continue reading...</a>",
