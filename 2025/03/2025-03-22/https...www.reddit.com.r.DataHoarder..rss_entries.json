In the old one I ran 3 drives 4TB each in a RAID-5 array and it worked fine for me but I have heard RAID-Z is faster and generally more modern. New machine also has 3 HDDs but 8TB each instead, is it worth switching to RAID-Z with this one? I will add that I would like to have the ability to expand my raid array or add an additional parity drive to convert it to a RAID-Z2 array. That used to be impossible back when I was setting up my first NAS but I have heard recent updates to the ZFS standard have made that possible - is that true?
