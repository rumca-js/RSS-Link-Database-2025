        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is what happened to me. I was born in 1965 and have always been mostly into classical and jazz. I have always thought of music in terms of melody, harmony, counterpoint, form, and rubato performance. I have always been lukewarm toward the pop and country artists that were popular from the 60s through the 90s.</p> <p>Starting in the 2000s, pop and country changed. Melody, harmony, and key changes disappeared. Song structures became simple loops--no pre-courses, bridges, etc. They all used the same chord changes. Instrumental solos and accompaniment disappeared. Singing became pitch-corrected, auto-tuned, and soulless. Beats became quantized. Dynamics, tempo changes, and phrasing disappeared. Country became a caricature of itself--a kind of watered-down 4-chord pop-rock with obligatory identity-based lyrics about trucks and beer and patriotism. Pop became something that doesn&#39;t even seem like music to me.</p> <p>In the past year, artists like ",

I recall Porgy &amp; Bess songs, Three Dog Night&#39;s Joy to the World (with cleaned-up lyrics for kids), and a song that was said to be Beatnik-style. There were four or so verses, the first one going something like:</p> <p>&quot;Shoo flies over the hill,<br/> If you can&#39;t find it,<br/> then nobody will.<br/> And when the man says, &#39;Fit my foot&#39;,<br/> Shoo flies...&quot;</p> <p>All verses were these snarky wordplay poetry, the second one I think had something to do with butterflies as butter flies.

I&#39;m so confused, because it is a pipeline that exists in our society everywhere, like how most hippies grew into capitalist pigs etc. Why is that? Were they ever authentic or are they always following the Zeitgeist and political climate in order to not be left behind? Part of me understands the edgy aspect where when u want to do something new, conservative becomes more experimental than experimental. Sort of reminda me of Bowie and his white duke era. But still..shit sucks either way, because it seems more real and less performative</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ziggysternenstaub\"> /u/ziggysternenstaub </a> <br",

After an albums is released, Apple Music might tell me, if the artist is already in my library.</p> <p>Today Apple Music told me of an album released today, and one released yesterday. Enjoyed both. But they aren&#39;t on the Wikipedia 2025 albums list.</p> <p>All Songs Considered lists a lot of the week&#39;s new albums the following Monday. Is that the best source to find recently released music?</p> <p>Where do you learn about upcoming or recently released music?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SandstoneCastle\"> /u/SandstoneCastle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jgzioj/best_source_to_find_upcoming_or_recently_released/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",
