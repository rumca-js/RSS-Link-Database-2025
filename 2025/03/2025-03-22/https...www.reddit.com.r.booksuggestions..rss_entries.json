I seem to really love WWII fiction with a little romance but more focused on the struggles of that time. I also like historical fiction that adds some fantasy elements into the stories but those seem less common than just straight WWII historical fiction.

With a 1st person pov from mc OR dual pov from couple. This is important, it&#39;s so much easier for me to get into a book when it&#39;s focused on a character or two. The focus should still be on the fantasy/scifi/dystopia but i like a little romance, so no Romantasy. Couple should not be seperated for majority of the book.

But when the movie was annouced a lot of people read the book and there are mixed opinions and I guess I wanna know how well written is it, and if it romanticizes toxic relationships/behaviours like her other works ? Is it actually a view of what getting in and out of a toxic relationship is like or like, what ? I&#39;m very confused and unwilling to read something that&#39;s like After or 50 shades of gray or the like ever again. I am so not keen on reading a book where an abuser/toxic person gets excused for their acctions, forgiven and having their happily ever undeserved after. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OutlandishnessNo8531\"> /u/OutlandishnessNo8531 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jgvhto/is_it_e",
