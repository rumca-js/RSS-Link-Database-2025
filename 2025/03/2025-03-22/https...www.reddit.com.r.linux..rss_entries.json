It was only able to run Win10 (which was alright for the time being) and I have been trying out several Distros for about half a year and none really worked. I had Linux Mint which was okish to work with (after MAJOR Grub-modifications), Ubuntu didn&#39;t work at all, PopOS didn&#39;t work and also Manjaro gave me a blackscreen after asking me whether I wanna go with proprietary or open source drivers....</p> <p>I am at the end of my wits here, the trouble seems to be hardware-related according to what most of the research gave me and I am willing to try out most of the common distros but if anyone had similar trouble or knows a solution please help me...</p> <p>So Linux Mint specifially worked but I tried to start Final Fantasy 8 via Steam and I was hardstuck in the loading screen due to graphic driver-related issues</p> <p>SOS</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",
