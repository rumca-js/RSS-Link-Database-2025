Over the past year, I\u2019ve been exploring different aspects of AI, both from an academic and practical perspective. I recently completed two AI courses through Stanford Continuing Studies, which provided a solid foundation in the concepts and potential applications of AI. Building on that, I\u2019m enrolled in a hands-on AI class later this month through UC Berkeley\u2019s OLLI program. I\u2019m looking forward to gaining more practical, real-world experience in applying these technologies.</p> <p>At the same time, I\u2019m working on improving my programming skills, specifically in Python.
