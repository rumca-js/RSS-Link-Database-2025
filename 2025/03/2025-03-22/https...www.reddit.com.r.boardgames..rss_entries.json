I think it was a shoots and ladders game. </p> <p>The last page I remember was witch themed and was set in these tree houses and it was my absolute favorite. </p> <p>I was born in 2005 and had this book as a young child so it\u2019s from around that era. </p> <p>If anyone is familiar with what I\u2019m talking about let me know I miss this game so much and it\u2019s so nostalgic to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cr1msondawn\"> /u/cr1msondawn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/",

Alternatively, you can place the tile as a piece of railway to extend your network, and if the colour of your action matches the colour of the adjacent piece of railway you get to use that action one last time before that tile becomes a piece of infrastructure. </p> <p><strong>Voidfall</strong> is also based on cards that you play from your hand.
