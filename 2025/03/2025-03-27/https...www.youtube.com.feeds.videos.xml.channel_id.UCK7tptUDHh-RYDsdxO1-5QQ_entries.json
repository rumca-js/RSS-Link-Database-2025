        "description": "The Trump administration is invoking the \u201cstate secrets privilege\u201d and refusing to turn over information about the ICE deportation flights that sent alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Agua to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. First-hand accounts, along with analysis of court documents and flight tracking data, reveals the administration\u2019s calculated effort to send Venezuelans to El Salvador before lawyers\u2014or a judge\u2014could halt their plans.\n\nAs the legal battle intensifies, WSJ explains what really happened in the run up to the flights from the airport in Harlingen, Texas.  \n\nChapters:\n0:00 El Salvador flights\n0:55 The week leading up \n2:36 The ACLU\u2019s actions and departing flights\n5:31 What\u2019s next?\n\nWSJ video investigations use visual evidence to reveal the truth behind the most important stories of the day.\n\n#Trump #Deportation #WSJ",
