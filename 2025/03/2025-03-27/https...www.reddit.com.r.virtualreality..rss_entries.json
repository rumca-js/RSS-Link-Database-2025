Haven&#39;t used anything for a few years, then pulled the trigger on a quest 2, then psvr 2, and finally quest 3( which I still use as my preferred headset)</p> <p>I am running a i9- 11th gen, and a 3090.</p> <p>However, have upgraded to a 5090 and a ryzen 9950x3d which should arrive within a month.</p> <p>So the question is - will I notice the jump going to a new vr headset? I was impressed with the psvr2 However, I still find the quest 3 the best.
