        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just watched the recent 60 minutes interview of Herzog. Holy crap he was the most interesting person I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I love movies but Herzog\u2019s films seem way out of my wheelhouse. Can you guys let me know where to start on this? The bear movie seems crazy. The hauling the boat up the hill seemed interesting. My tied for favorite movie is Best In Show and Hezog seems like an insane Christoper Guest. Thanks for your feedback. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jeanheff\"> /u/jeanheff </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jlg51c/werner_herzog/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jlg51c/werner_herzog/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But a snapped arm bone can&#39;t really be treated like this and whatever he could do he&#39;d still be left crippled to a point where he&#39;s unable to to do the only job he&#39;s capable of. Without going to a hospital he&#39;d no longer useful to his employers. </p> <p>I don&#39;t know if any of this is a part of McArthur&#39;s intention.

Both parties shoot each other and all appear to be dead. When the cops arrive the cops find the money and the drugs and decide to keep it for themselves. </p> <p>Later they are contacted by a crime scene technician who informs them that one of the dead parties was an undercover narcotics agent, and their discussions to keep the drugs and the money were recorded because the dead cop was wearing a wire.

I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth. </p> <p>The dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert. </p> <p>To be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry ",

Joe Hisaishi&#39;s score just soars, it truly is perfect. </p> <p>If you have any opportunity to catch this limited showing this weekend - don&#39;t miss this.
