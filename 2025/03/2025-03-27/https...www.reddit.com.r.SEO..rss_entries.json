In Feb 2023, traffic is down to 4,5k. March 2023 is 2k and April 2023 is 300. Then the whole year stays around 200-300, when it finally becomes 0 in Jan 2024 and has stayed like that pretty much ever since.</p> <p>I am 100% certain that I can grow this webpage, because it&#39;s set up quite nicely, and is on WordPress which I&#39;m used to working with.

After initially having lots of pages indexed and also ranking decently for some of them, at some point in the fall of last year, google decided to index more and more pages every day, and we only rank for our brand name specifically now.<br/> I was told that this is nothing to worry about - it&#39;s just due to low authority and will fix itself with more backlinks and time. I&#39;ve worked hard on getting some good backlinks from pages within my niche (none paid for!), but the situation hasn&#39;t changed. Semrush shows an authority score of 11 for us now and it even says &quot;Poor traffic to backlink ratio&quot;. I know semrush&#39;s authority score is just basically a guess and not an accurate number, but still, I believe that means that with our backlink profile, we should have atleast some authority.<br/> Almost 300k of our pages were indexed - it is now down to 107.
