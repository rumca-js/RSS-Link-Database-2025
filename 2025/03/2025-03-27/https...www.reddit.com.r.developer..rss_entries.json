Personally, I was never made aware of the importance of my physical health at work.</p> <p>I started my career as a backend developer (Ruby on Rails) ten years ago in Paris.

Lower back pain, elbow issues, neck pain...</p> <p>Today, I&#39;m genuinely interested in how companies address this issue:</p> <ul> <li>Is taking breaks good or bad for productivity?</li> <li>Does your company encourage active breaks or movement during the workday?</li> <li>Have you also experienced pain or physical discomfort related to your profession?</li> <li>What are your personal tips for maintaining good physical health as ",
