My class is about American Women Writers, and we have to find a piece that we think should be taught in the class. I\u2019d really like for it to be strongly representative of womanhood in some way because I have to argue its importance. I don\u2019t have time to read outside of classes lately, so I have no idea what\u2019s good and Google isn\u2019t much help. Does anyone have any recommendations?

SHE has a cat named Schr\u00f6dinger and baked a lot. He was pretty popular because he made a questionnaire that &quot;made people fall in love&quot;, thats how his twin sister and her husband fell in love i think. They were kinda enemies to lovers (they did it in the copy machine) and at some point started competing for something?? i think it was funding for research, im not sure. They also went to a conference where he got sick and she took care of him and the ended up doing the questionnaire. He had a neighbor that happened to be his twins sister best friend who kept hitting on him. Also, SHE (the main chracter) was training for a marathon with her girlfriends if i remember correctly. (The cover was a guy and a girl dressed for the office (obv) and i think she was on the left side and him on the right side)<br/> Guys i am losing my mind WHAT BOO",

Not to say that every book that&#39;s popular online is bad, but... well, you know. Basically I&#39;m looking for a romance that meets the following two criteria:</p> <p>1) Characters that actually have a personality and chemistry. I&#39;m sick of this insta-love &quot;trope&quot;. It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re not trying to explore the concept of &quot;love at first sight&quot; but rather want to get to the spicy scenes faster. I&#39;m not opposed to sex scenes in my books, but not at the expense of the plot and characters. If that&#39;s all I want I&#39;ll just read some 30 page erotica where the sex is the &quot;plot&quot;. </p> <p>My other problem with the insta-love trope is that it&#39;s often written like fanfiction-- not in that it&#39;s poorly written, but that it feels like the characters are bland and poorly written BECAUSE some tropes only work in a fanfiction setting.

Such depth built, complex characterisation and handling misery of each character differently. Like in the book, the protagonist was a low-key non-ethical guy, however much better than the people around him. Along the lines of his ragged and wretched soul somehow experiencing everything and going through silent traumatic drills inside himself. The presumption of literal saying is as if the protagonist is truly in a sense less than zero. The kind of book that would put me through that bleak emptiness and insanely disturbed as well as nauseous feeling despite having no presence of any intense gory details and relying on its subject matter and writing aside from shock values. I have already read all of Bret Easton Ellis so not any of his works. Nonetheless, Any great recommendations like Less Than Zero by him?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",

I prefer fantasy where you could remove the romance and the book still be fire (The Shepard King Duology, Immortal Dark, Where The Dark Stands Still, The Scarlet Veil, The City We Became Duology, [Emily Wilde as well, but it could&#39;ve ended at book 1 without the romance and been fine so it&#39;s only a technicality and is on the line for my preferred balance of romance to everything else]). However, much like the books mentioned, if there&#39;s romance, I want it to be <strong>good.</strong> I like books with spice (I&#39;m cool with max level chili peppers), but the leading plotline shouldn&#39;t be the romantic relationship. I do occasionally read romance, but it&#39;s almost exclusively dark romance (The Ruinous Love Trilogy and similar) except for my one true romance series (Assistant to the Villian), but that series has a lot going for it and I still think I&#39;d enjoy it without the romanc",

A couple of days ago, I went down a Sherlock (BBC series) rabbit hole and came across an article apparently written by Benedict Cumberbatch in 2012. My understanding is that links aren&#39;t allowed in submissions, but you can find the article if you google &quot;Holiday Holmes: Benedict Cumberbatch in the Seychelles.&quot;</p> <p>So I read the article, and loved it! For the first time in a while, I felt drawn in and compelled to keep reading a somewhat long written piece, and I would like to replicate the experience in book form.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend any books which read similarly? I think the article could be described as descriptive and relaxed but still somewhat fast-paced, with bits of humor.

That last one especially seems like an obvious subject for a book but I can&#39;t seem to find any good ones??? It seems crazy that a country could be chopped up then sewn back together like that and just keep on keeping on. So any recs are appreciated! I only read English, unfortunately :( TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/67giyvhbh\"> /u/67giyvhbh </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jksgan/books_on_modern_political_history_of_europegermany/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jksgan/books_on_modern_political_history_of",
