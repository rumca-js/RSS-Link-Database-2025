There are newer games that run better and I read that Halo has some ineffective particle rendering.

I generally use Proton Hotfix or Proton Experimental but I&#39;ve tried other variations.</p> <p>The situation is: I&#39;ll start the game, play for a bit and then input stops working in the game. The game is running but frozen. If i alt-tab away from the game, the game will start running again. alt-tab back into the game and it freezes.</p> <p>So for example when this happens i can hit escape then alt-tab (wait a sec) alt-tab back and the escape menu will show up. I can then click on the item i want. alt-tab away (wait) alt-tab back and that click will register.</p> <p>I can play D4 pretty consistently, but BG3 lasts about 5 minutes before this happens.</p> <p>Anyone run into this? Most games I play don&#39;t have the issue just those 2 so far.</p> <p>Running: An Dell XPS15 with PopOS 22.04 &amp; nvidia RTX ",
