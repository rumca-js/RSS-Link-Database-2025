I was playing a game of Anachrony and managed to build &quot;Uranium Cores&quot; which for a free action enables you to power up an exosuit during your action phase.

But something I&#39;ve noticed, both in my own circle of friends and family, and in online discussions, is the way a lot of people perceive the &quot;cost&quot; of games. </p> <p>Have you seen comments on here questioning someone&#39;s large board game collection when they excitedly share, especially when they are new to the hobby? The sentiment often revolves around the idea that if a game isn&#39;t played dozens of times, it&#39;s somehow a frivolous or wasteful purchase. But I think we should break it down and add more value to the experience of playing a game.</p> <p>My most played game is Pandemic, which I picked up for around \u20ac30. I&#39;ve played it about 15 times now, which works out to a cost of just \u20ac2 per play. For a solid hour of engaging entertainment, and a shared experience, doesn&#39;t \u20ac2 feel incredibly reasonable?</p> <p>Conside",
