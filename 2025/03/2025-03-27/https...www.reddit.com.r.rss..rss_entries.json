That\u2019s basically why I built it, to make sharing of blog lists easier.</p> <p>I hope it\u2019s valuable for you too.</p> <p>Oh, and if you like it and want to see more features, please comment, I\u2019ll see what I can do \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/domysee\"> /u/domysee </a> <",

RSS is a way to curate, but keyword / similarity based filters are just too rough to capture the nuances of what someone might find valuable.</p> <p>After a bunch of exploration - here&#39;s where I landed: a personal AI &quot;Scout&quot; that has context about me, and scrolls the web / feeds / twitter / etc on my behalf, to surface information that&#39;s actually valuable to me.</p> <p>To start with, Scout focuses on tech sources (space with very high info overload). Long-term, I think we will benefit from an AI system that can act as middle-man for all our information consumption, enabling much greater signal-to-noise.</p> <p>I\u2019m onboarding a few dozen new users/day on to Scout at the moment. Would love feedback from fellow RSS enthusiasts\u2014if you\u2019re curious to give it a spin: <a href=\"http:",
