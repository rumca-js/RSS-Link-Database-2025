I personally am regretting spending a credit on this book. She is very Willy nilly happy go lucky \u201coh haha just gunna switch some name tags(this is kinda shitty tbh) and run at horses hehe silly us\u201d now she\u2019s spending five minutes talking about herself and her shark attack, I had to take a break.</p> <p>Isnt this book about Mark Zuckerberg? Does it ever get to that or? I\u2019m confused about the narrative as well. She\u2019s so snarky and condescending, like yeah Mark is feeling uncomfortable and awkward, that\u2019s actually pretty human, are we faulting him for that? </p> <p>Jeez it\u2019s really aggravating and I\u2019m only on chapter 1. so my question is, should I give it more of a chance? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SnowflakeSorcerer\"> /u/",
