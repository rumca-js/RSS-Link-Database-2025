A lot has changed in the MCU since the events of Avengers: Endgame, including the fact that there isn\u2019t actually an Avengers team anymore. New heroes have been rising up to fill the void left by Iron Man and Captain America, but it\u2019s going to be a while before we get a proper Avengers movie again. Even Captain America: Brave New World stops short of reuniting Earth's Mightiest heroes.\nOnly at the end of Phase 6, when Marvel delivers the one-two-punch of Avengers: Doomsday in 2026 and Avengers: Secret Wars in 2027, will we see Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes reunited. Who will answer the call? Now we know, with Marvel revealing the full Doomsday cast on a livestream.\nWho made the cut in Marvel's newest Avengers lineup? More importantly, why are these characters being included? How does this roster build on the Multiverse Saga so far? Here\u2019s the cast of characters you can expect to assemble in Phase 6.\n\nAvenge",

I feel old now. What are your thoughts on Sony skipping Bloodbornes birthday again?\n\nThis week\u2019s show is Jada Griffin, Akeem Lawanson, Brian Altano, and is produced by Nick Maillet\nBeyond! is a part of Geek Media Podcast Network, an IGN Entertainment Brand.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5",
