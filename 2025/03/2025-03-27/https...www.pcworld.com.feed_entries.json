At least when they have a unique design like Ugreen\u2019s Nexode, which has enough juice to charge multiple devices at once <em>and</em> has a magnetic wireless charging pad that doubles as a phone stand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it\u2019s pretty crazy\u2026 and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Magnetic-Power-Column/dp/B0D4F34SB4/\">it\u2019s on sale for $100 on Amazon</a> (was $150). That\u2019s a hefty 33% discount on a fantastic accessory that\u2019s sure to be both practical and a conversation starter. How do I know? Because I have one of these! And I can vouch for how awesome it is. Sure, you may not end up with this one in your purse when going to a concert\u2014it\u2019s a little bulky\u2014but it\u2019ll fit well into, say, a laptop bag or backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chunky 20,000mAh capacity is ideal for recharging p",

I\u2019m mainly referring to Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series and AMDs Radeon RX 9000-series graphics cards and what they mean for VR gaming performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll get to that in a minute, but first a quick snapshot of PC VR performance in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vr-and-the-best-graphics-cards-of-2024\">VR and the best graphics cards of 2024</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024 we saw some gamers adopt Nvidia\u2019s RTX 40-series and AMD\u2019s 7000-series graphics cards in PC VR gaming.

It was on the very first PC I recall using, literally on my father\u2019s knee. But I don\u2019t need it anymore. That\u2019s a weird thing to say as a writer for a site named PCWorld. But it\u2019s been a long time coming, a slow mix of broad tech trends, feeling betrayed by multiple brands, and a little bit of intention on my part.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, I still <em>use </em>Windows. It\u2019s what I\u2019m using right now to type this, <a href=\"https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/109/642/844/995/072/330/original/4edd35721a3337a3.jpg\">on a beefy gaming desktop</a> I assembled myself, with triple monitors and all sorts of googaws attached. But I don\u2019t <em>need </em>all that anymore, and for the first time in my adult life, I can see myself transitioning to an entirely different operating system.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019",
