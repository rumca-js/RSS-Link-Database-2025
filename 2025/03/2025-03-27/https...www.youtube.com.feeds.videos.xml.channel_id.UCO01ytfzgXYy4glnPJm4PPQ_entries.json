        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Republicans in Congress interrogated the left-wing political hacks who run NPR and PBS at a hearing yesterday. Is it finally time to remove all federal funding from these activist groups posing as news organizations? We\u2019ll discuss. Also, Donald Trump outrages trans activists with his speech marking Women\u2019s History Month. And feminists are angry at a woman who expressed gratitude to her husband for helping care for their baby. Is gratitude in marriage a bad thing, as these feminists claim? My answer won\u2019t shock you.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:28 Opening\n02:05 - 24:41 This Insane Hearing Is Evidence That State Media Should Be Immediately Eliminated\n25:47 - 33:36 Trump States That Men Cannot Be Women\n33:37 - 39:47 Public School Teacher In Texas Makes TikTok About His Gender Euphoria\n39:48 - 44:03 Son Of \"Snow White\" Producer Speaks Out About Zegler's Comments\n46:37 - 1:02:54 These Bitter Feminists Are Canceled\n\nEp.1564\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://x.com/peterboghossian",
