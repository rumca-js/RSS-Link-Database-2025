After 15 hours of troubleshooting my servers and services at home, finally discovered that having you\u2019re real subnet as a docker network will indeed break your network and cause frequent router crashing making you think that your ISP is just sh*t. Even though I had a service on it at one point it still messed with things until I removed it completely. One small mistake made me question for an entire day what it possibly could be until I finally discovered the little error in docker that was causing the entire problem.</p> <p>TL;DR: Do not use your subnet for docker networks, just use the defaults it gives you unless you know how the",

Were allowed to use AI at school but they block most ChatGPT servers for some reason and we all hate using microsoft copilot. My school has a blacklist firewall, so only things that they say are blocked are blocked. So most random or self hosted sites work just fine!</p> <p>I was wondering if theres a way I could hook my ChatGPT Premium API up to a website that I host myself that my friends can access from a self hosted domain name and maybe add a login portal just so I can keep track of users. Kind of like a online Photomath or Gauth AI type thing where you ask it a question and it replys to you through the interface. All connections to the API will be through my hosting end and it can be protected and managed through a login portal.

And it would be perfect if it was able to derive just for informational purposes the proportion of ingredients that using say 100g of that sauce used.
