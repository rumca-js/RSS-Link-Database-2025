I&#39;ve changed my drive Xodo (idk if it&#39;s private yet but it works really well, so I&#39;ll check on that). I&#39;ve deleted apps and use browser for logins. I&#39;ve moved my passwords from chrome to bitwarden and I&#39;m slowly changing passwords to randomly generated secure passwords. I&#39;ve been using the proton email aliases function for anything new that I have to enter my email. I&#39;m moving my photos to ente. And I&#39;m thinking about making one of my phones my main device for any social media with a vpn. I changed keyboards to futo. I switched from Google keep to joplin for notes. I&#39;m a total newb at this so how does all of that look?</p> <p>Question1: I deleted Instagram and Facebook accounts and now use signal with a few people But is there a texting service that is not an app like signal? I want to replace Google Messages. </p> <",
