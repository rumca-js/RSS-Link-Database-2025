Later, I moved on to data-related topics like pandas and numpy because I wanted to work in that area in the future. Around this time, I bought <em>&quot;Python Crash Course&quot;</em> by Eric Matthes (which I highly recommend), where one of the projects was a basic to-do app in Django.

The most expensive element by far is the &lt;select&gt; input, especially with a large number of options. I&#39;ve tried a text input with &lt;datalist&gt; instead which solves the problem but it&#39;s not ideal for my case due to other reasons.
