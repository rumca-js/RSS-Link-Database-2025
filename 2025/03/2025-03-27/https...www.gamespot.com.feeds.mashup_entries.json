The dungeon-crawling RPG series has been an iconic part of gaming as a pioneer in Western RPGs, setting a foundation for others to follow and build upon. Diablo 2 created an entire subgenre of similar titles originally referred to as action-RPGs (Diablo pioneered and popularized real-time combat in isometric computer RPGs) but are now more commonly called ARPGs to avoid confusion with behind-the-back action-RPGs like The Witcher 3. Regardless of what term you use to describe them, these isometric RPGs all aim to recreate Diablo's satisfying gameplay loop with an emphasis on dungeon crawling, monster slaying, character-enhancing loot, and multiplayer features. However, it's definitely fair to say that some Diablo-likes are better than others.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In case you're looking ",

The village still has plenty to see and do, though, as you can meet NPCs, head down to the bar, barter with traders, and\u2026 solve a murder. If you enter St. Katherine\u2019s Church on the east side of Wyndham Village, you\u2019ll come across the Vicar standing over a dead woman\u2019s body in the back office.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Naturally, you might try to investigate the scene but the Vicar is adamant that he doesn\u2019t want you poking your nose around the murder. Of course, that can\u2019t stop you, and this begins the Murder in the Church investigation in Atomfall. To see how to complete the quest, check out the full walkthrough below.</p></h3></p><br/>     <p><h2>Speak with the Vicar and Pamela Shaw</h2><img src=\"https://",
