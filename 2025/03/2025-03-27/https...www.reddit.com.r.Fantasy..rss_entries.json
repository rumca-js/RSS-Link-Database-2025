If it matters I have ADHD/Autism that makes me do weird things: So somehow it takes me about as much time to read <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em> as something like <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>. It&#39;s actually harder for me to read the fantasy novel because I have to put myself in a totally unique position, but with philosophy it&#39;s like I can already relate to it somewhat before reading (and do research into the book beforehand).</p> <p>To use an example most of you can relate to, I tried reading the Hobbit and I cannot for the life of me remember the names of the people in the party, where they go, etc. I love the movies and enjoy the fantasy and action, but I still, even after watching it multiple times, cannot remember the name of anyone (Edit: I had forgotten the names Thorin, Balin and E",

I had a friend who hadn&#39;t seen it, so I told him, &quot;Watch Season 1. Don&#39;t watch anything after that and pretend that is the end.&quot; One of the reasons I recommend this was because the end to Season 1 is actually really strong, so you can feel like you have closure. (And also, a certain person they killed off in Season 1, to great effect, was revived in Season 2, completely ruining the emotional power of that death in Season 1. But, I digress).</p> <p>That got me thinking: What series out there are there that you recommend reading up to a certain point, and then stopping there, even though the series continues?</p> <p>Also, on a similar note, there are incomplete series.

The second book, Cursed, got real dark, real quick. <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The more I \u201cread\u201d the more I cheered on the main character, hoping that maybe this time she\u2019d win just once, only to see her pulled deeper into the shit.</span> The ending was climactic and gave me all the feels. </p> <p>Kudos to Rebecca Soler, the narrator of the audio books, she really made the story real.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gudakesa\"> /u/Gudakesa </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jku9hr/the_gilded_series_by_marissa_meyer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments",
