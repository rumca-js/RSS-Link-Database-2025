However, she was VERY chill about it and after talking about it she told me that maybe I should tell the other friends in our friend group too. So.. yeah, I told my best friends that I\u2019m gay for the first time. And they handled the situation very well, unlike I had imagined. Of course they were surprised at first but they accepted me in the end. One of them even told me that they had suspected it for a while though. I haven\u2019t told my parents yet(they are super conservative so maybe I won\u2019t forever) but I\u2019m relieved by the fact that at least some of my close ones know the fact that I\u2019m gay:) Just a passing thought tho, one of my friends told me that she has a ",
