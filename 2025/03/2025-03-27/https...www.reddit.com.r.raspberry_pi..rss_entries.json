Would it be better to train a custom model with my own pets or tweak the confidence threshold of a pre-trained one? Any recommendations for IR lighting or camera settings for better night detection? Tips on reducing accidental sprays?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s done something similar or has advice on the best hardware/software setup.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p",

However there is a TON of glare when doing so using the normal camera module v2.</p> <p>Ive researched into it quite a bit and it looks like getting a circular polarizing filter is really the only way to remove the glare. So, my plan was to use a arducam high quality camera with a lens CS2006ZM06, and apply a circular filter on that.</p> <p>My 2 questions are, should I get a 28mm or 30mm filter. On the mechanical drawing, it has a inner diameter of 28mm and an outer of 30mm. On the website of circular polarizing filters I&#39;m looking at there are both sizes avaliable.</p> <p>My other question is, do I even need to get a lens for the B024001? Could I theoretically just put the CPF right onto it?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rawrxdxdxdxdxdxdxdxd\"> /u",
