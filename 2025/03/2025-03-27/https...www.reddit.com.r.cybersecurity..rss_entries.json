So a lot of this corporate/business side to security is new to me and although I\u2019ve heard a lot about it I\u2019ve never actually seen it. And I have to say, if this is what every org encounters I can see why it can make security so much harder or even go as far as saying the breaches some orgs may face is understandable from the perspective of the security team. </p> <p>The recent oracle breach generated quite a bit of chatter, none of which I was directly involved in. Neither were some of my other co workers on the security team. Non-security people were managing a conversation about a security breach. The only people that were involved were my manager the head of security as well as people from BI???? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

While this may seem to be simple helpful suggestions as a consultant, this actually can cause a significant amount of confusion on the client side, especially if these reports are directly escalated to senior leadership. Your client is left to defend themselves, and demonstrate that these things are in fact performed, or in place. This is further complicated when you&#39;ve had a change",
