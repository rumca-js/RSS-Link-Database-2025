Everything is working fine so far, but I noticed, I can&#39;t flash the controller when applying less than 5V. I did some tests and noticed, the controller only starts at 5V and stops working at 3.7V. It won&#39;t reset until Vdd has risen to 5.1V. I configured the PVD (2.85V/2.7V) but this didn&#39;t help. Do I need to set the POR settings, if there are any besides the PVD, in order to get it working at 3.3V? If so, how? The datasheet only says, the default POR is 2.5V.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lammsein\"> /u/lammsein </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1jkzk7k/ch32v003_only_works_at_5v/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1jkzk7k/ch32v003_only_works_at_5v/\">[comments]</a></span>",
