However, the idea came from another product that was completely similar but no longer is in production.</p> <p>The idea is simple:</p> <ul> <li>Find discount codes for your favorite brands.</li> <li>No signup required in order to copy and find deals.</li> <li>Signup only required to share discount codes and links.</li> <li>Save money and earn money for your brand or affiliation.</li> </ul> <p>This is my first go at launching a product. I have plenty to learn and plenty to fail on.

Think of it as a mix between a tycoon game and a competitive business simulator. Players design hotels, manage staff, set room rates, and implement strategies to outperform competitors.</p> <h1>Why I started building it</h1> <p>I&#39;ve always loved management sims but felt most of them lacked a competitive element. I wanted to create something that combined creative building with strategic business decisions in a way that friends could compete against each other.</p> <h1>How far along is it?</h1> <p>I&#39;ve built:</p> <ul> <li>The core hotel design system</li> <li>Basic economic simulation</li>",
