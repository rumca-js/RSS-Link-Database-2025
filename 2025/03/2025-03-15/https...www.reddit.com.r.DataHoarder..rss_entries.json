I don\u2019t have a homelab yet, much less a tech background. I really want to archive a few channels, but between the time crunch, the learning curve, and the amount of information/jargon, I\u2019m overwhelmed. I\u2019ve searched through this sub, <a href=\"/r/homelab\">r/homelab</a>, and internet searches, but all the information I find assumes a base level of knowledge I don\u2019t yet have. I figure I can just get started using the computer I have for now, and worry about expanding storage and performance after this.</p> <p>So, is there anyone patient enough to tell me in fairly simple terms what steps to take to get my first download working?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jacrava\"> /u/Jacrava </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jbjo2q/remedia",
