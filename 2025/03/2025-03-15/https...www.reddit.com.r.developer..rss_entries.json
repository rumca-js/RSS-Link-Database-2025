I hit a huge wall when I couldn\u2019t find the <code>icui18n.lib</code>\u2014only had the <code>.dll</code> which I had to download separately and was not in the recent ICU offering. Almost gave up.. I ended up writing a program to convert the <code>.dll</code> to <code>.lib</code>, got through that, and then found <code>getopt</code> and <code>getopt.h</code>... but then my ninja build failed due to more ICU utf file issues.</p> <p>That&#39;s when I decided to just drop translation from my project.</p> <p>Any tips for building things like this on Windows or anyone else hit this wall? It is a little crazy-making.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Algae1135\"> /u/No-Algae1135 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jc3g75/the_struggles_of_building_apertium_on_windows/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><",

You can manipulate images (cropping, resizing, adding filters) <em>before</em> uploading, which saves a ton of processing time. Also, the optimization features help keep images lightweight without losing quality. Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re dealing with a lot of image uploads!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Queasy_Importance_44\"> /u/Queasy_Importance_44 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jbpdn0/streamlining_image_uploads_with_filestack/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jbpdn0/streamlining_image_uploads_with_filestack/\">[comments]</a></span>",
