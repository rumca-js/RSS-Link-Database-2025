I don&#39;t keep anything on my main OS (Endeavor) so fresh installs are like second nature to me. Tried every method under the sun. No dice.</p> <p>Some of the problems attributed to getting DR to work on Linux is that I&#39;m on AMD. DR makes it damn near impossible for AMD users. Last week I upgraded to my new 9070XT but the Mesa drivers are spotty atm. The card is beast but I also need it for HW acceleration when it comes to editing my projects.</p> <p>I have several spare SSD&#39;s lying around and I think this is the best route.
