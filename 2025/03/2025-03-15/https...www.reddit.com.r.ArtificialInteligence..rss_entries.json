And I am just blown away.</p> <p>It&#39;s not 100% perfect. The cadence of conversation isn&#39;t always quite as steady as I would like, with a few gaps just long enough to pull you out of the zone, and sometimes the voices get this little glitch sound that just reminds you they are real people.</p> <p>That&#39;s it.
