I thought it&#39;s better to save my contacts directly on my device and make regular manual back-ups instead of another cloud storage. But every few days, I loose all my contacts. Sometimes after one day, sometimes after one week. I have no idea what triggers it and how to stop it. What&#39;s the degoogle meta to store contacts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Laugnaritter\"> /u/Laugnaritter </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1jbptmv/contacts_after_degoogle/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1jbptmv/contacts_after_degoogle/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Before TC, I was using DuckDuckGo app tracking which worked really well, but I noticed that it would use a lot more battery than TC, so I switched to TC. Now I read on a few other threads that instead of using app trackers, they were using a private DNS like Mullvad. One of the potential benefits I could see is extended battery life since it wouldn&#39;t require the use of the built in VPN functionality in android. </p> <p>Would anybody recommend this?
