To my surprise, most of their backlinks looked like low-quality junk \u2014 but they\u2019re still ranking really well, especially with exact match anchor text. Network graph was also suspicious but still ranking really well. </p> <p>I\u2019m trying to follow good backlink practices, but an SEO manager I once spoke to told me, &quot;Don\u2019t worry about the backlinks \u2014 just get whatever you can get.&quot;</p> <p>Now I\u2019m stuck wondering\u2026 does backlink quality really matter as much as people say? Or is it more about volume and anchor text, even if the links are low-quality?
