A post on Foster\u2019s social media account on Saturday confirmed the split, with the bag man implying the decision was Fitzpatrick\u2019s.</p><p>Rounds of 78 and 72 meant Fitzpatrick comprehensively missed the cut at the Players Championship. On six events on the PGA Tour in 2025, the Englishman has finished no higher than tied 22nd. Foster was only due to caddie at around half Fitzpatrick\u2019s tournaments this year, including next month\u2019s Masters, but now the relationship has ended abruptly.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/15/matt-fitzpatrick-players-championship-golf-billy-foster\">Continue reading...</a>",
