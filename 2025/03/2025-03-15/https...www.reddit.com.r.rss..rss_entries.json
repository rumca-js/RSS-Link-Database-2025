This is huge setback for me as feedbro was perfect for me as features like filters, highlights, tags, compact view, etc helped me alot. Being just a browser extensions it fit well with my workflow. </p> <p>But now I am hunting for new setup, which is FOSS/open and decent functionality. So curious what other people are using and why they are using it.</p> <p>p.s. I am open to to explore Selfhosted.
