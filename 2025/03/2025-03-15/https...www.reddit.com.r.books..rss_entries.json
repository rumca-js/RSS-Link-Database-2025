Scientifically, it\u2019s been proven that it activates the same parts of the brain as sitting down to read a book. Personally, I enjoy audiobooks and appreciate their difference to reading a physical books. This comes up mostly when I read memoirs. If available, hearing the author read the book about their life feels one of a kind, as though you\u2019re having a personal one-on-one sit with them. A great example of this was when I listened to/read Matthew Perry\u2019s book just after he passed away. It made it more special, more intimate. And I count that book as \u201cread\u201d that year. </p> <p>I\u2019d love to know more about people\u2019s own thoughts on this, though.

I think GRRM in particular is extremely talented in naming characters. I find them all so grand and pretty. Even the simple names like Jon Snow is cool to me. Margaery Tyrell is another really one I appreciate! I&#39;d argue fantasy books tend to have all the cool names but I&#39;m curious about other genres as well!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sixeyedgojo\"> /u/sixeyedgojo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jbzc69/coolest_names_youve_read/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jbzc69/coolest_names_youve_read/\">[comments]</a></span>",
