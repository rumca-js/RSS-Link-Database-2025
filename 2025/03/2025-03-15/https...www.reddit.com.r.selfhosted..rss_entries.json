I made it to wrangle my ever-growing pile of bookmarks on Twitter/X. It\u2019s live now, and I\u2019d love your thoughts! Here\u2019s the gist:</p> <p>Why I Built It: I was tired of losing track of X posts \u2014X technically offers bookmarking, but you\u2019ve got to shell out for Premium to organize them properly. I wanted that functionality, so I rolled my own. Started with X in mind, but I\u2019ll integrate other platforms like Reddit down the line.</p> <p>What It Does:</p> <p>Paste a link (Twitter/X), hit save, and it\u2019s yours. No login, no fuss.</p> <p>Organize stuff into folders.</p> <p>Syncs across devices with a slick QR code or link. No account needed; it just works.</p> <p>Local storage so your bookmarks don\u2019t vanish, plus an export option.</p> <p>Try it out here: <a href=\"https://bookmark.ryanm.tech\">https://bookmark.ryanm.tech</a></p> </div><!",
