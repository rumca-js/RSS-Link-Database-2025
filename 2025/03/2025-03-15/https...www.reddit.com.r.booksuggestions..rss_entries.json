I adored PJO when I was her age, and I have other recommendations for her, like Six of Crows, maybe the Grisha trilogy?

So, get this. Wife (A) and husband (B) marry. For some reason, wife is sent away and its been 4 years and husband is engaged to new woman (C). Wife apparently gave birth to a baby while gone. Somehow A goes into a coma and C gets it told to B that she died. He does no research ofc so he thinks A is dead and then finds out he has a 4 yr old daughter. C fakes her actual daughter as B&#39;s daughter. While A and B&#39;s real daughter is treated as an orphan and subjected to bad juju. Long story short, A comes back for her daughter and finds out how shes been treated. Decides to pretend to be someone new as the sister of herself. She plays dirty against C and B. She fakes an engagement to his archnemesis. Unfortunately she ends up back with B in the end. I want this in a book, but like she falls in love with the nemesis and he t",
