The capability is already in the game, can there be a mod made to just have it on launch? I don&#39;t care about being misgendered too much because transitioning is still very new, so I&#39;m okay with it. I just want to LOOK like a boy without having to finish the whole damn game. I don&#39;t want all that other tricky stuff like trying to mod in different bath stuff or pronouns. I just wanna look like a boy.</p> <p>Like... again, the capability is already in the game.
