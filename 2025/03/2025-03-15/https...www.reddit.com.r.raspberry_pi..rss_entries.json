There is no product I could find or data to answer this question: </p> <p>I have a Pi camera on a motion platform, and the ribbon cable is moving with the camera for many cycles. I can&#39;t find any best practices or products for connecting the Pi to the camera with a robust cable that is tolerant to motion. Any advice?
