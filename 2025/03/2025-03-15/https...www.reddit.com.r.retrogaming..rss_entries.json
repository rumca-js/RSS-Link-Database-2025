I want to be able to play it with a joy stick and buttons, just like it was back in the 80s and 90s at arcades. After some research, I bought a powkiddy a13, and absolutely none of the games loaded and worked. I know there are ways to get batocera on it, but I am lost on how to do it, even with video instruction online. </p> <p>I am familiar with emulation and retroarch and MAME emulation on a computer, but I am completely lost at it. The juice is just not worth the squeeze to emulate the games with files and roms and other various downloads and steps to take. </p> <p>I am simply looking for a plug and play option with an a joystick and buttons. I would prefer portable if possible. By portable, I mean something no larger than a briefcase, so a pandora box type option would be fine.

It was so retro where all you had on screen was blue and arrows directing you to nearby prey like stone crabs or a Portuguese man o\u2019 war. The only other thing on screen in my memory is a mini map showing the ocean and a beach shoreline with a river tributary. Please help me identify which game this was!! Does anyone remember this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scurvycharles\"> /u/scurvycharles </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jbjtzu/help_identify_a_shark_game_from_my_childhood/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jbjtzu/help_identify_a_shark_game_from_my_childhood/\">[comments]</a></span>",
