So far, I&#39;ve built the backend using both Django and NestJS. Django has been incredibly easy to work with, but I decided to give NestJS a try since our team has more experience with JavaScript. Django&#39;s ORM and Auth are straightforward and simple, while with NestJS, I&#39;m using MikroORM and PassportJS. Overall, Django feels more stable and less of a hack to piece things together. </p> <p>I\u2019m leaning towards Django as the right choice since it&#39;s more mature and stable, and it just feels like a better fit. However, my team is more full-stack JS-focused, so I\u2019m torn. Any thoughts or opinions on this? Has anyone been happy with their decision to go with django over a node backend? </p> <p>One thing I really appreciate about Django is the admin\u2014it\u2019s quick and easy to set up. That said, we also have Directus for the CMS part, though it\u2019s not open source. </p> </div",

Not just one or two, but more than <strong>10 containers running simultaneously</strong>, each performing different tasks. Initially, I thought of using function-based tools for this, but then I wondered\u2014<strong>what if an AI agent could directly run and manage Docker containers instead?</strong></p> <p>So, I decided to build a <strong>Python package</strong> that allows AI agents to seamlessly <strong>spin up, control, and fetch results from Docker containers</strong>, alongside function-based tools. Instead of just calling functions, the agent can now:</p> <p>\u2705 <strong>Launch and manage Docker containers</strong> dynamically<br/> \u2705 <strong>Execute tasks inside containers</strong> and retrieve outputs<br/> \u2705 <strong>Combine function calls and containerized execution seamlessly</strong></p> <p>With this approach",
