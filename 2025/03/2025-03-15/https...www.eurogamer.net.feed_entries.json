The wait was worth it as scalability is impressive and the game also includes the ability to toggle ray traced global illumination - which may well hint at the kind of RT features we can expect to see in the upcoming <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357\">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-grand-theft-auto-5s-pc-rt-enhancements-hint-at-gta-6-features\">Read more</a></p>",

As an irredeemable nerd who gets overexcited at the prospect of a download progress bar reaching heretofore unseen speeds, I knew that I had to try it out to see if it actually offered a noticeable improvement over the more readily available 900Mbps BT service I had before. Would there be a tangible benefit for gaming, content creation and downloading Linux ISOs? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-16gbps-broadband-reviewed-is-multi-gig-internet-worth-upgrading-for\">Read more</a></p>",
