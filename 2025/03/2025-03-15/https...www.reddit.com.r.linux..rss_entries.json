She went to the PC and I noticed that it runs Linux. It looked like an older version of KDE. Okay, Linux might be getting more popular for such use-cases, if I had a company like this I would also use Linux, so maybe not that special.</p> <p>But what really amazed me was their software. It is as simple as it gets: a TUI with green text and black background, no mouse input, all done by keyboard, navigating around, entering in some numbers, and within seconds she printed something for me.</p> <p>It reminded me of an opposite example at my health insurance provider, where she had to click and move the mouse for 5 minutes until she printed what I needed.</p> <p>Are TUIs still the GOAT?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/S4ndwichGurk3\"> /u/S4ndwichGurk3 </a> <br",
