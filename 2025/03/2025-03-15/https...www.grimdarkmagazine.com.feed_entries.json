        "description": "<p>Darker than black and covered in blood and viscera, Anna Stephens\u2019 Bloodchild is a thundering capstone on her Godblind trilogy. She finishes this merciless, multi-POV, pulls-no-punches series by weaving together cynical banter, intense action, and gut-wrenching heartbreak with a delicate-but-masterful touch. As with the last two books, my favorite character is Crys Tailorson. His transformation from \u2018fuck off and let me coast through life\u2019 to \u2018I\u2019ll carry this world to salvation myself\u2019 has been nothing short of epic. From homophobe to proud gay man, from malingerer to savior, Crys\u2019 journey is the grimdark version of Sanderson\u2019s Kaladin. While Crys is my favorite, he had to battle some steep competition. Rillirin, Dom, Tara, and Mace all have strong arguments for being \u201cthe stand-out\u201d. You could even throw a curve ball and throw in one of the villains, like Corvus or Lanta. When Stephens penned Bloodchild it\u2019s almost like she was the conduit and the characters spoke for themselves.",
