It was a breeze to read, and weaved all its magical explanation with an interesting story, solid character work, and even a bit of reflection. The writing flowed much more naturally than in Mistborn.

I have read to her the entirety of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by Tolkien, which she loved for its simplicity, its light-hearted mood and the sometimes funny writing. Now we&#39;re done with the Hobbit and we&#39;ve tried The Fellowship, but that was a little too dark for her and we&#39;ve tried Ann of Green Gables, but that was a little too convoluted (long sentences - and English isn&#39;t my native language). </p> <p>So, is there anything you can recommend that in tone and complexity is similar to the Hobbit?

I loved a lot of things about this: the city was very vividly drawn, and I liked the details of the climate and the way that different types of people lived. It had the kind of trickster-y/heist/action in the shadows energy happening that you get from a lot of Wells&#39; fantasy.</p> <p>But one of my biggest take aways was that Wells was not yet amazing. It&#39;s a great effort, certainly above the baseline standard at the moment. The imagination and the writing style were strong. But it still was a bit clunky and the pacing was off at times.

Is it some outstanding masterpiece like the books were (in my opinion)? No. But it&#39;s good TV, it&#39;s paced well, has great character development, engaging politics, and a good amount of tension. It&#39;s also course-correcting a bit from the weird decisions of the first season and feels more loyal to the books than it was before\u2014though it still makes a lot of changes so I wouldn&#39;t call it a faithful adaptation by any means, but I still think it&#39;s a good one.</p> <p>If you&#39;re looking for a faithful adaptation of the books, it still won&#39;t be for you. But if you want some good fantasy TV, I really think there&#39;s a lot to like about The Wheel of Time.

How he is so repetitive and tells us how we are suppose to feel and not show us, uses an extremely predictable plot that has zero twists. And untimely has a bit of a let down of a showdown with someone who is suppose to be on the levels of Twyin Lannister. Also Thomas has zero qualities that are relatable. I have so many more complaints, and have tried searching for like minded criticism, but have yet to find any. I have actually found praise from some people who have criticized Brandon Sanderson and his recent works.
