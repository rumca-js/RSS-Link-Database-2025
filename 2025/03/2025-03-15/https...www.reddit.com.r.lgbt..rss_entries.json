It got revealed to me when I was 21 that my biological mom is my aunt and when that happened she was already on her deathbed. She was missing me so much and I couldn\u2019t fly back to see her for the last time due to covid. For 21 years, she had been supporting me silently behind my back without revealing the truth. Seeing how hurt she was from the fact that I only found out when she was dying, I thought about coming out to her as lesbian, so that she would thought of her choice for giving me away as \u2018fortunate\u2019 rather than a regret. I couldn\u2019t get myself to do it over the phone. I started with \u2018Actually\u2026.\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t continue. I\u2019m left now guessing what her reaction would\u2019ve been. Knowing that I have the power to switch between the love and hatred someone has for me with 2 words makes me\u2026hateful, resentful and possibly confused, even till the day I die. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",
