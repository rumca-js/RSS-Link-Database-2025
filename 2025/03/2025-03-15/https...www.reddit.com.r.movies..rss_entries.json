This film has new, younger characters who are believable and (mostly) likeable, a well-written story, interesting subplots/ back stories which don&#39;t detract from the main storyline, a new artificial life character who is different from any we have seen before, plus some tub-thumping one-liners which pay homage to Ripley.

When Ramirez is telling Connor why he has to leave his wife, he explains that his last wife&#39;s father was named Masamune, and made his katana around 600 BCE. Later in the movie, it&#39;s brought up that the katana&#39;s metal is in fact dated back to around 600 BCE, but it&#39;s also brought up that this is very strange, considering Japanese katanas weren&#39;t made like that until the middle ages. (And this lines up with history; Goro Masamune was indeed a real Japanese swordsmith, but he lived around 1300 CE.) The reason Brenda is so invested in figuring out this case is because finding that sword would be like (as she says it) finding a 747 from a thousand years before the Wright brothers were born.</p> <p>This is all very intriguing, but it never reall",

We&#39;ve all complained about Hollywood&#39;s over-reliance on adaptations, remakes, and sequels instead of original ideas, but all of us have at some point gone to see movies solely because it&#39;s an IP we liked. So with that in mind, what are some movie franchises that have been dormant for a while that you&#39;d actually be excited to go see if they got a new installment?</p> <p>I&#39;d personally like a new National Treasure movie with Nicolas Cage (I know there was a TV show, I didn&#39;t like it).

From the slow burn intro series over the moon landing site, to the military/invasion/dread angle, to the blissful ignorance of what\u2019s coming. Just so good.
