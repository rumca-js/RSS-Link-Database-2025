        "description": "The Stylistics have released a new album and I'm on it! \"Falling In Love With My Girl\" is the album and it's me - Justin Hawkins - playing the guitar solo on the title track, so I wanted to tell you about it. There is no video for the song, so I asked my producer to improvise. Unfortunately, she did. It's not clever or funny and we're not talking anymore.  \n\nTo listen to more of The Stylistics: https://www.youtube.com/@UCvdxB-s4VxPBZNs9I1P_gTw \n\nThe new Darkness album is released on the 28th March,   you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nSee The Darkness on tour across the UK this month,  tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nFrom mid March, watch more episodes of Justin Hawkins Rides Again and find Behind The Scenes footage from The Darkness On Tour on my Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides A",
