It&#39;s easy to identify bad documentation out in the wild - many of us have an intuitive sense when a project&#39;s docs are hard to understand. It is not surprising that most of the &quot;bad docs&quot; are maintained by software engineers, and unfortunately we do not apply the same rigor to our documentation as we do to our code.</p> <p>To get our docs quality to match our code quality, we need to treat our documentation as a software design problem. Just like our code, we need to write documentation with clear goals of what problems we are trying to solve (and for whom!), a vision for our ideal end state, an understanding of the tools at our disposal, and a plan to organize our ideas. The good news - we as software engineers know how to do all of these things, or have allies who can help us along the way!</p> <p>My thoughts in detail here: <a href=\"http",

When AI assistants interact with web applications, they typically lack context about what components do, how to interact with them, and what data they handle.</p> <p>Right now, this framework is making tools out of the components that decorators are thrown on top of but the goal is to expand that to different types of components and types of behaviours like for login, it would be sending a request back to the auth endpoint and getting back the token and putting that in all the subsequent calls.</p> <p>I went with a HOC approach first but ran into too many problems and cons so shifted to a decorator style approach.</p> <p>The whole mission is to enable developers ",
