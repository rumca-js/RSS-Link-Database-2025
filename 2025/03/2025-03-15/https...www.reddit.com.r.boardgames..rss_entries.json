Universal classic monsters like Dracula, Creature from lagoon, Frankenstein monster (with bride of Frankenstein) terrorise the city. Heroes need to pick up useful items all over the map and bring them to certain locations to defeat monsters. And rescue civilians in danger, too.</p> <p>Still this aspect of the game is pretty bland, the best part of Horrified are antagonists: 6 thematic monsters to choose from (though you will use at least 3 of them in every session, so longtime replayability is not good), and each one has to be defeated in its own way; for example, to beat Dracula you need to destroy 4 of his coffins. Otherwise game is very simplistic; too simplistic and too samey for me. </p> <p>On the other hand, it can serve as decent family game, especially if you enjoy classic horror movies with monsters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

I started reading mistborn books and have hero realms base game, the ruin of thandar and the wizard pack. If I had to choose the mistborn or the new big hero realms box, which should I choose?</p> <p>If you want to give other recommendatuons, here is some extra info: I like deckbuilders. My favorite boardgames so far are slay the spire, spirit island, mansions of madness, dice throne, quacks of quadlinburg, stardew valley.</p> <p>I play mainly solo, due to lack of people who lack time or interest. I might just buy some expansion to mansions of madness or spirit island, but my brain does get more dopamine when I can explore and play new things.</p> <p>Looking forward to see what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Meloncocox\"> /u/Meloncocox </a> <br/> <span><a href",
