Articles, YouTube videos, and forum posts agree that Assassin's Creed is in decline, but why? While Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey and recent AC games technically offer more content than the PS3 and Xbox 360 eras of Assassin\u2019s Creed, much of what's been released recently feels wooden and underbaked, with the Assassin's Creed story suffering because of it. Assassin's Creed 3 featured a rich, and meticulously crafted story, but from recent games, Ubisoft has traded that level of storytelling for freedom and RPG elements.\n\n#AssassinsCreed #Gaming #Games",

From games and comics to TV and blockbuster movies, there\u2019s a dash of Sonic everywhere. But we\u2019re here specifically to celebrate the mainline Sonic game series and pick the very best.

Some games, like Sonic Adventure 1 and the original Sonic the Hedgehog, are important to the Sonic series and set the foundation for both 2D and 3D Sonic games to follow. But we felt they both didn\u2019t quite hold up as well as their sequels when judged by a modern standard, so they just missed a place on this list.
