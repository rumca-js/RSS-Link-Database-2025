I\u2019ve never been able to get the thing comfortable on my face. Sometimes it feels like my eyebrows are rubbing on stuff, sometimes the bottom portion of the interface feels like it\u2019s smushing and pushing down on my cheeks, and sometimes the sides of the interface feel like they\u2019re pulling my eyes tight to the side. Nothing ever feels natural or comfy, especially the second I start to sweat. It always just feels like a brick trying to squeeze or stretch my face in a weird way. I love playing vr games but just can\u2019t deal with how it feels, especially as a sensory autistic person.
