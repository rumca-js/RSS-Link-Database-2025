I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll remember to go this time.\u201d But come Monday morning, scrolling through Instagram and seeing all the epic photos from the event I missed, I was downright livid with myself.</p> <p>That\u2019s when it hit me: there had to be an easier way to remember events without drowning in endless details. Out of that frustration, <a href=\"http://pic2cal.xyz/\">pic2cal.xyz</a> was born. </p> <p>I built this app to solve my own problem\u2014losing track of the events I care about. Now, I simply expand on the details from any social media post, snap a quick screenshot, and upload it to Pic2Cal. The app extracts all the event information for me, and with one click on \u201cAdd to Calendar,\u201d it syncs everything to my calendar of choice\u2014automatically and effortlessly.Remember, if your first version doesn\u2019t make you want to tear your hair out, you\u2019re not pushing hard ",

After a bit of research, I couldn\u2019t find a good tool to prevent it, so I decided to build my own. I polished it, published it on the Mac App Store, and did a few Reddit posts and an article on an Italian blog.</p> <p>To my surprise, my app reached #1 on the paid apps chart in Italy, and I thought, \u201cWell, this is it. I\u2019ve made it!\u201d But after looking at the Reddit feedback, I knew that the numbers couldn\u2019t be huge. Sure enough, the next day, the official reports came in. I had just 12 downloads that were enough to land me at #30 globally, and only 6 downloads put me at #1 in Italy.</p> <p>I\u2019m honestly surprised by these results.
