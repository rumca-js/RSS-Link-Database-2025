So I came up with this prompt for the reasoning o1 model. </p> <blockquote> <p>I want to discover what the new 4.5 model considers a successful response to understand its goals to spot misalignment.

From my view, existence can be interpreted as a limit point that encodes an elementary particle by parsing a group of limit points in an initial state (big bang). Every limit point interacts with others through collision, i.e. a change of an existence component where the result is a value crossing the threshold of another existence\u2019s corresponding component value. </p> <p>If we want existence to encode experience, existence will require change of state, so existence must be represented by at least two component values (e.g. a point moving on a line). Say we have a line space: multiple existences cannot organize themselves on it without being \u201cobscured\u201d by another existence point, i.e. it\u2019s impossible to for points in one space to access the other without collidin",
