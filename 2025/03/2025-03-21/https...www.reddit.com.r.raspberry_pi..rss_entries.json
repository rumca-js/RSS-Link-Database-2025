However, when I execute the request from my computer to the raspberry pi while connect to the raspberry pi directly, in Access Point mode, the response is either very slow to arrive or the request never completes. I know that the request was well received and treated on the raspberry pi because of print statements, it is only the response that is not going through properly. I suspect it is more a networking issue on the raspberry pi access point mode rather than an issue with the flask server.

I have a couple questions I can\u2019t find trustable resources for: How do you connect the RPi\u2019s (and if the 5 is different than predecessors) to a arduino (micro computer or shield/board) if they don\u2019t have a USB port? CAN you connect any arduino to a RPi and what\u2019s the requirements for that? Does wifi/boards work with GrapheneOS or require stock android? Can I have 2 raspberry Pi\u2019s (3/4\u2019s) connect with eachother to control something and how easy is it? I\u2019m autistic and the internet sucks these days for reliable information and all I found was \u201cyes you simply connect a USB between both boards\u201d, nothing about the above. If there\u2019s a manual or page online specifically for this question, feel free to send it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/THUNDERF430\"> /u/THUNDERF430 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

The camera would use motion detection to snap a photo every time a new item is thrown in. The goal is to compare each new photo to the last, isolate the newly added item, and then send that image off for AI-based image recognition (either using an external service like Google Gemini or TensorFlow on-device or on a connected server). Ideally, the system could identify what the item is and whether the item was recyclable, compostable, or actual landfill waste.</p> <p>Eventually, I\u2019d love",
