The Eagan family experienced some major losses, but things weren\u2019t all sunshine and roses for Mark, Helly, Dylan, and Irving either.\n\u201cYou and your family created hell and you\u2019re going to burn in it,\u201d an enraged Helly R. tells Jame Eagan in the beginning of the Severance Season 2 finale. But will they? Watch the video and let\u2019s dig in!\n\nBe warned, of course: Full spoilers follow for Severance Season 2.\nWe learn a lot about what\u2019s going on at Lumon before the credits roll on Season 2. We\u2019ve spent almost four years wondering what the Macro Data Refinement (MDR) team was doing on the severed floor, and it turns out that every time Mark (Adam Scott) and his team complete a new file, they create a new consciousness for Mark's wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman).\nMeanwhile, Helly (Britt Lower) - or is it Helena? - remains a big mystery.

The new upgrade system and the amateur portion of your player\u2019s journey have reinvigorated Road To The Show, while the shift away from Sets and Seasons has righted Diamond Dynasty\u2019s biggest wrong. While it\u2019s a bit of a bummer that the Storylines feature isn\u2019t living up to its full potential, it remains a worthwhile and important inclusion that has reach beyond the game of baseball. All the small touches like updated infielder reactions and new quick time events have the on-field action in a great place, too. It\u2019s not always easy for an annual franchise to justify the move to a new entry, but in the case of MLB The Show 25, it does more than enough to make me glad it has arrived.",

Via the Verge, the image was taken down soon after, but this adds more speculation to Microsoft's future Xbox plans and possible integration with Steam, Epic Games Store, and more. Xbox head Phil Spencer has already voiced support for letting gamers play their Steam library on Xbox consoles. In other news, Assassin's Creed Shadows is topping the charts after just one day since being released. According to Ubisoft, the game has seen 1 million players across all available platforms. Of course, sales data is not yet available, but the game is also riding high off strong critic and user reviews. And finally, co-op hit Split Fiction's success is catching the eye of Hollywood, and now a package is being put together to shop an adaptation to the big studios.",

        "description": "Atomfall reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.\n\n\"Atomfall is a gripping survival-action adventure that takes some of the best elements of Fallout and Elden Ring, and synthesises them into its own fresh mutation. It presents a picturesque chunk of English countryside littered with alluring structures to pique and reward your curiosity, eccentric locals to meet, and absorbing mysteries to unravel, and uses classic iconography from British sci-fi and horror to consistently unsettling effect. In spite of some enemy behaviours that are occasionally less stable than a reactor in meltdown, Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take.\"",

There are huge, save-killing bugs. The interface lacks what I would consider to be some fairly basic functionality. And the often strong city-building layer doesn't harmonize well at all with the over-scoped and cumbersome strategic map. Maybe some substantial patches could theoretically let me recommend Kaiserpunk on its strengths as a city builder with a novel premise. But for now, I can't even really do that. The trenches may have vanished under the plow, but playing Kaiserpunk still leaves me feeling shell-shocked.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

We wanted to focus on coop games that were truly built around that cooperative experience. This is a list of the top 10 cooperative games, not the 10 best games that happen to be playable cooperatively, which is why you\u2019ll see a lot of games that can only be played with two players. \n\nAlso, to keep this from stepping on the toes of other genres, we\u2019re omitting MMOs, MOBAs, and any games that are solely focused on competitive cooperative play. We want to highlight the games that bring people together to work towards a common goal that\u2019s not simply \u201cbeat the other team.\u201d\nThis is an update to our list from 2021.
