Let&#39;s say an org receives a variety of data, some discrete that aligns with a published spec, and some in documents like PDF, text, etc.</p> <p>In the current environment, the discrete data requires an engineer to review, perform mappings, ETL, and such to land the data into a structured database. The non structured data also has an engineer add some meta data to classify it, then place it into the same structured database, often storing the meta data discretely and the document in a file.</p> <p>I feel like AI is close to not requiring that effort but I need a sanity check. </p> <p>Would it be possible to take data &quot;as-is&quot; and store it as files only no matter how it came in. Now, any analysis or questions you have if the data is simply performed via AI that ask questions and get results. Are we at the point where AI can do this without classifyi",
