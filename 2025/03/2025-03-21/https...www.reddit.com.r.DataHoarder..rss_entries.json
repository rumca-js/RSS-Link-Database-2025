I am currently in the works of having a clear out as sadly I do not have the physical space to store them let alone set up a scanning system (which I may be able to elsewhere in a loft). I am in the UK and have looked up that the Internet archive does take magazines as physical donations. What are peoples experience in donating magazines or other items to internet archive? Is it possible for them to scan and make them accessible publicly, as the magazines are 10 years or such old. Or is there such a service that people have used for scanning magazines to PDF, that could then get uploaded to archive.org? It would be amazing if users could pay Internet archive to scan and digitise magazines for users with a guarantee of being uploaded, including loose magazines (not sure what lose magazines means or how it is defined).</",

I ram a few tests (even paid for hddsentinel) and everything appears great. However, one of the readings for hours comes out to approximately 4.5 years. HDD sentinel estimates the lifespan to be 270ish days. All other indications show its a good, well cared for drive. Being that I&#39;ve never had an enterprise drive, is this cause for concern? I figure if it&#39;s lasted this long, it&#39;ll keep going assuming good conditions (I know it&#39;ll eventually go to crap). I&#39;m just wondering if I can reasonably expect a good few years out of this drive, or if it will actually take a dump in less than a year.</p> <p>I know there isn&#39;t a perfect science for this, nor an exact answer.

I don&#39;t know the details, but I guess their financials were a mess and they basically closed shop in the span of a month. All references to the tape products are gone from their main site. Their support doesn&#39;t exist anymore, only auto-responder left on the support email address. Their knowledge base and support pages still have some manuals, but these have also been purged to some extent. This brings me to the main problem... ALL of the links to firmware downloads have been removed. </p> <p>I&#39;m trying to find firmware for a Neo series T24 tape library and a Neoxl 40 tape library.
