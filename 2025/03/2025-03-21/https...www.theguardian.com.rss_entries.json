It was November 2009, while he was hunting for a club after exiting Alav\u00e9s of his native Basque Country, and after trials with Gillingham, Norwich and Swansea, Southampton\u2019s visit to Rovers in the FA Cup was next on his itinerary. \u201cI stayed in a bed and breakfast round the corner, on Gloucester Road,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cThe last thing I was thinking then was: \u2018I could coach here.\u2019 It was kind of romantic when I came back.\u201d</p><p>Calder\u00f3n is back in League One, this time fighting relegation from the sidelines.
