I put it in maximum resolution which usually gives a better distance view, but that did not work here. Everything seems too close up to me though. It&#39;s hard to maneuver around and see anything, because so many things fill my screen that shouldn&#39;t fill my screen. I started out in default which was the lowest settings for 1999 machines.<br/> Any ideas about what I can/should try to monkey with?<br/> Edit: I did go into configure and changed the screen resolution there.
