I usually upload my movies to a cloud storage, and then use RaiDrive to map it as a HDD and play my movies from it. I always have left over storage in each account, around 2gb. And i want to use up as much as i can to save myself from creating more and more accounts, because it&#39;s just time consuming and i don&#39;t like having multiple accounts with so much space left in them. Is it possible to get like a 6gb movie and split it into two 3gb parts, and upload one part to Account 1, and the second part to Account 2, and use something like Plex or some sort of media player to combine them as one? Or is what i&#39;m asking just not possible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RyanGarcia2134\"> /u/RyanGarcia2134 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

I&#39;m only familiar with software to do this sort of thing on Windows, and while I&#39;d be happy to help her I&#39;m not going to be home again for another two months so if there&#39;s something simple she could do on her own on a Mac that&#39;d be great. A lot of the best programs seem to require windows, android, a CLI, or can&#39;t export while keeping playlists intact. </p> <p>Sorry I know you all get spotify questions 50 times a week lmao I tried searching the subreddit and couldn&#39;t find anything solid for mac/iphone ^^&quot; She loves her apple products and doesn&#39;t want to switch lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cr4",

But for Ubisoft games it seems to be very difficult.</p> <p>They still don&#39;t have Avatar, Star Wars and the new Assassin&#39;s Creed probably will take forever.
