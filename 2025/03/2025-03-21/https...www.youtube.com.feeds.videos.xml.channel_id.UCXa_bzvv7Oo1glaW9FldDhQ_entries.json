        "description": "Borrowing elements from Stalker and Fallout that it then mixes with a smattering of its own unique ideas, Rebellion's first-person open world post-nuclear survival action game has quite a lot going on right from the very first second. \n\nIt\u2019s also a game that prides itself on holding the player\u2019s hand as little as possible and instead allowing you to figure things out for yourself- which means it\u2019s entirely possible that there will be some things that you\u2019ll pass by entirely. To help make sure that doesn\u2019t happen, here, we have compiled a few handy pointers that you should keep in mind as you behind your bizarre journey through the world of Atomfall.",

        "description": "Atomfall is a much better game than you probably think it is. Rebellion Developments has consistently delivered solid games with its Sniper Elite and Zombie Army outings, but with Atomfall, it has delivered something far more polished, better designed, and narratively interesting than any of its past outings. \n\nNot only does it boast a memorable setting that\u2019s dripping with unique atmosphere and is defined by a distinct, eccentric identity unlike anything else, it also touts impressive design that feels refreshingly and confidently hands off. \n\nThe result is a game that emphasizes player agency, encourages exploration, rewards curiosity, and above all else, respects you as a player. Though admittedly clunky with its combat and stealth (the former in particular), Atomfall is ultimately still an easy game to recommend.",

        "description": "It's been a pretty strong year for games already, what with the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. However, there's plenty more to come and DOOM: The Dark Ages is one of the biggest to look forward to.\n\nAnd it's not big in just hype - id Software's eagerly awaited sequel could be the biggest title in the franchise. It features the developer's largest-ever play spaces and its biggest campaign by a fair bit. The storyline encompasses an important period - the rise of the Doom Slayer - and the sheer amount of new things, from the mech to the dragon mount, is awe-inspiring.\n\nSuffice it to say that DOOM: The Dark Ages is shaping up to blow its previous entries out of the water in terms of sheer epic size and scale when it launches on May 15th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.",
