        "description": "Advances in the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 over the past 15 years have yielded important new insights into the roles that specific genes play in many diseases. But to date this technology -- which allows scientists to use a 'guide' RNA to modify DNA sequences and evaluate the effects -- is able to target, delete, replace, or modify only single gene sequences with a single guide RNA and has limited ability to assess multiple genetic changes simultaneously. Now, however, scientists have developed a series of sophisticated mouse models using CRISPR ('clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats') technology that allows them to simultaneously assess genetic interactions on a host of immunological responses to multiple diseases, including cancer.",
