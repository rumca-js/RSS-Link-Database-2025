        "description": "Today we take a look at the many incidents of notorious Irish former priest, Neil Horan.\n\n\n\"Cornelius \"Neil\" Horan, sometimes referred to as The Grand Prix Priest, The Dancing Priest, or The Armageddon Priest (born 22 April 1947), is a laicised Irish former Roman Catholic priest who is noted for his interference with the running of the 2003 British Grand Prix and the 2004 Summer Olympics men's marathon in order to promote his religious belief that the end times are near. He was arrested and spent some time in jail in Germany in 2006 when police found out about his plans to stage a pro-Nazi demonstration during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which included a poster he made praising Adolf Hitler.\nHoran went on to appear on Britain's Got Talent in May 2009. He danced a soft jig on the show, received a standing ovation by the audience and was put through to the second round. He did not make the live semi-finals. In 2017, he showed his support outside court for disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris",
