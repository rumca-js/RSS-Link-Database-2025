Im speechless really. </p> <p>Also, the way it was made is absolutely stunning. Stop motion is awesome, sad that its not used a lot nowadays. </p> <p>Im not going to spoil much here, and Im going to say to go watch it yourself. Amazing movie. </p> <p>Its about a Fox and his family getting into a conflict with three &quot;corporate&quot; food giants, that eventually evolves into a full blown war between the two, and even drags other animals into the conflict. </p> <p>There are also some elements of philosophy too, so yeah. </p> <p>All in all its a solid 8.5/10. The only bad thing was that its short, but then again its based on the book, so yeah. Go read that too if you would like.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomGuy1525\"> /u/RandomGuy1525 </a> <br/> <span",

I am personally offended by Russel Crowe as Javert in Les Miserables. </p> <p>Anyway, I think we should take a second to appreciate how good movie musicals can be. What is everyone\u2019s favorite movie musical and why? Also, if anyone has more thoughts on why musicals get hate from movie lovers I would love to hear it. (Other than the classic excuses about realism vs. corniness that don\u2019t apply to the good stuff)</p> <p>My favorite is Cabaret (1972). I highly recommend movie musical skeptics give it a shot. It is serious and political with eight Academy Awards (it was up against the godfather too!). It is especially relevant to the climate in America right now and the musical numbers are diegetic if you are picky abou",
