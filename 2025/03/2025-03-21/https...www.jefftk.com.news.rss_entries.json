        "description": "<p><span>\n\nA few months ago I was trying to figure out how to make bedtime go\nbetter with Nora (3y).  She would go very slowly through the process,\nprimarily by being silly.  She'd run away playfully when it was time\nto brush her teeth, or close her mouth and hum, or lie on the ground\nand wiggle.  She wanted to play, I wanted to get her to bed on time.\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\nI decided to start offering her \"silly time\", which was 5-10min of\nplaying together after she was fully ready for bed.  If she wanted\nsilly time she needed to move promptly through the routine, and\nbeing silly together was more fun than what she'd been doing.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThis worked well, and we would play a range of games:\n\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><p>Standing on a towel on our bed (which is on the floor) while I\npulled it out from under her.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>That, but jumping and I needed to time the pull right.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>We roll around with me tickling her.\n\n</p></li>\n<li><p>That, but I keep pretending to fall asleep ",
