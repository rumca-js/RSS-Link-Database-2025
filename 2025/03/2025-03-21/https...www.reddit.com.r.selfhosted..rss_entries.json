I&#39;ve installed nordvpn, and the idea was to use meshnet to access the services.</p> <p>When I had my previous server (running Windows and Docker Desktop), I could point at the meshnet IP and the server ports and everything would work just fine. However, I can&#39;t seem to connect to the docker services via meshnet under linux. I can SSH into the server just fine, but not connect directly to any of the services using the meshnet IP. This means I can&#39;t push/pull from Gitea, access Homarr, etc.</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> <p>(I&#39;d like to stick with meshnet for the moment. I&#39;m setting this up in my spare time, and looking into Tailscale or Cloudflare is on the list but is not something I can action at the minute.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wait_whats_this\"> /u/wait_whats_",
