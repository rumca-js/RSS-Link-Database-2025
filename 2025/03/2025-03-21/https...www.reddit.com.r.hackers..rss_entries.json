I don\u2019t know how he is even getting my friends numbers because I never gave them to him nor have they ever had contact with him. He knows how to code but I\u2019m not sure what kind and never thought he was technically capable of doing these things. Hell I never thought he was emotionally or mentally capable either but it\u2019s all coming to light this past week.</p> <p>My question is how is it possible he is getting their phone numbers? These are for friends that have very little online presence. Like an IG and thats it with barely any photos. How is he messaging from multiple numbers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/youbetcha415\"> /u/youbetcha415 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1jgtg2z/how_is_it_possible_to_find_ppls_phone_numbers_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",
