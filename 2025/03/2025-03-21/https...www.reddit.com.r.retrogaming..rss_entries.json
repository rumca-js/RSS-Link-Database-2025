I&#39;ve just been looking at the 5x Pro but I can&#39;t really afford to drop \u00a3300 on it for some consoles I play every so often. I&#39;m not playing my consoles on a big TV or monitor (only a 27&quot; 1440p one) so it doesn&#39;t need to be fancy or anything. I&#39;m also using an Legato 4k MK2 for capture. My current set up is a PS2, GameCube, Wii and N64, all consoles apart from the GameCube are using cheap HDMI adapters, my GameCube has a Carby so slightly more expensive but works great. All consoles are PAL but I&#39;d like to be able to play NTSC games without any visual issues too.</p> <p>Is there anything folks can recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Techsnologic\"> /u/Techsnologic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jgu2vy/retrotink_alternatives/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",

Pretty fun top down shmup. Hard as heck though, haven&#39;t got past stage 4 on Normal difficulty. Really cool level up mechanic where your guns get more powerful the more points you score. Unfortunately your score is just based off what enemies you kill, there&#39;s no way to get point multipliers or anything like that. Good music. Looks nice. Haven&#39;t heard of it before. Would recommend it to anyone who like shmups. Not as good as MUSHA. Feels like a solid 7 or 8/10 game though.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kwus0zfr9",

Maybe more of gaming related stuff, such as consoles, games, controllers, handhelds. I also have some laser Diss movies. Records, blu-ray is in other things. Would it be okay to put boxes in the garage on top of something to make sure they don&#39;t get wet? Or would I be better off find similar to put them? That&#39;s more temperature controlled.
