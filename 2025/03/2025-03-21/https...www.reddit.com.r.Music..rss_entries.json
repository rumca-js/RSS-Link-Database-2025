For example, the first song, Mojo Pin, instantly reminded me of The Antlers\u2019 album Hospice and how his weeping, ascending vocals conveyed the vulnerability of life.</p> <p>There were many moments while listening to this album when I felt like crying, though I couldn\u2019t quite explain why. From the haunting opening melody of Hallelujah to his rendition of Lost Highway\u2014a song written by Hank Williams but often linked to Bob Dylan\u2014his raw talent was undeniable. He effortlessly shaped his vocals, shifting from soulful laments to folksy crooning with an almost hypnotic ease.</p> <p>Another standout was Jeff\u2019s rendition of the jazz standard Lilac Wine by the great Nina Simone.

People say he died from smoke inhalation from going back into the plane over and over again to help other people get out. (Edit: a person commented below that this is in fact a myth, which is interesting) There\u2019s a \u201cstan-fest\u201d out east every year, apparently. I was made to listen to his music when I was a kid, and eventually learned to love it. \u201cForty-five years\u201d, \u201cFogarty\u2019s Cove\u201d, \u201cFirst Christmas\u201d, and \u201cThe Mary Ellen Carter\u201d are some songs I recommend to anyone who hasn\u2019t heard of him and wants to give his music a try.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cmnsenseonurshoulder\"> /u/cmnsenseonurshoulder </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jgd2yw/do_noncanadians_know_who_the_folk_artist_stan/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://w",

The song started trending on TikTok about 3 years after it&#39;s release and is now far-and-away the bands most well known song. The whole <em>Satanic Panic</em> EP is sort of a &quot;side project&quot; within the band, that is meant to be a fictional 60s version of Ghost. I find it funny that their biggest hit is a B-side from an in-lore &quot;different&quot; band that got popular years after it&#39;s release.
