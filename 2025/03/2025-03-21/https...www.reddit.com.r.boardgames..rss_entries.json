I backed the recent kickstarter -- <a href=\"https://gamefound.com/en/projects/chip-theory-games/tanglewoods\">https://gamefound.com/en/projects/chip-theory-games/tanglewoods</a> -- but wanted to get the base game so I could play the original. </p> <p>But wow.. the game smells really strongly of chemicals -- ridiculously so. I have aired it out for several days but you can still smell it (just not as bad). Also, some of the dice have chips (and not the good Chip Theory kind) and look defective. Disclaimer: This is with the base game -- the dice, box and cards specifically. The expansion deck was fine.</p> <p>After doing some research, I found lots of BGG comments about the problems. And rereading the Kickstarter, they mention some manufacturing problems in the past. So my bad. I should have done my research first.</p> <p>So, if you&#39;re thinking about getting it, just want",

My issue is, I don&#39;t want to just rehash something like Game of Life or Monopoly with events from her life, I&#39;d rather it be something more original but I&#39;m at a bit of a loss on how the actual game would be played, has anyone ever created something similar or does anyone have any suggestions on how such a game would be played? </p> <p>Any questions that might help with suggestions, fire them over and thank you in advance for any help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
