I was blown away by how many job seekers gave it a try and shared their experiences. While a good number of you landed new roles and many received interviews, plenty of others only got rejection emails.</p> <p>But we also noticed a pattern: a lot of these rejections happened <strong>before</strong> a recruiter even saw the resume. After digging into this problem, we realized it often came down to ATS issues, missing focus keywords, or not tailoring the resume to the specific job. That\u2019s why we spent the last four months building an <strong>AI Resume Builder</strong>.</p> <p>We tested nearly every resume tool out there, brought in recruiters for feedback, and even ran a private beta to fine-tune everything. The result is something we\u2019re really proud of, but still improving every day.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what it do",

I feel really stuck. There is no way I can fund my degree or even take a loan as an international student. The amount is just too much for me. $100k is not feasible. Does anyone know what i can do? It has been like this for 2 years now... I keep getting into universities but have no money to attend. And these are veryy specific interdisciplinary courses that are offered only by these universities, so its not like i can do it any where else. And most universities in my country suck and dont offer any such degrees. I even did my undergrad from georgetown but this campus was outside US, so I didnt get OPT. Anyone got any idea what i should do. I have tried external fellowships and scholarships but nothing is working out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

The program would use some sort of AI or LLM for the task. Do you guys think this idea is worth doing? I really want to do a real-world project that will help me and also others. Moreover I want this to be in the shape of a website. An important thing is that I can&#39;t spend much money on this application. Is this idea possible and is it useful?
