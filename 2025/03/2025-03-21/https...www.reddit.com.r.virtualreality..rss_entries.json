PCVR doesn&#39;t count because they can be played with any headset that supports connecting to a PC (literally all of them). You can&#39;t connect a quest 2 or 3 to a PS5, and you can&#39;t load horizon OS on a PSVR 2. </p> <p>Exclusivity is used to intice users on buying one headset over another, but long-term it&#39;s a losing game. No 1 VR user can just play all the top-quality VR games because they&#39;re tied to a specific headset brand, if not worse, a specific headset brand <em>and</em> a specific console in a specific brand of consoles. Quest 2 users have Batman, Assasins creed, OG Re4, Asgard&#39;s wrath 2, etc in and whatnot, meanwhile PSVR 2 users have RE8 and RE4R in VR, hitman, gran turismo, horizon, etc.</p> <p>This just ends up shooting both headsets in the leg, tho.

I also really like any of Apple&#39;s newer OLED displays especially for HDR content, though I do realize that&#39;s probably not going to be happening for a while. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s way more fancy optics properties at play that&#39;s important, but just based on back of the envelope calculation, this would mean around 10k resolution p",
