Wow.</p> <p>I installed Debian on a 20gb partition to check it out and maybe delete it afterwards, but after I saw I could choose KDE Plasma as a GUI my curiosity piqued. Once the install finished I considered it MUCH more stable and easier to use than Ubuntu. Specs aren&#39;t a problem as I&#39;m running the 2 OSes on a ThinkPad T14s (Gen 1) so I figure it&#39;s just Ubuntu acting that way. </p> <p>I may just end up using Debian instead as I am much much more impressed with my experience than Ubuntu after having heard it was a more &#39;technical&#39; distribution, though this may be due to KDE Plasma allowing me to customize the UI to my preference. </p>",
