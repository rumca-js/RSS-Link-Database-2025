The tone I&#39;m looking for is mostly lighthearted adventure, but I don&#39;t mind some real threats as motivation.

I loved how it jumped from story to story only for them to all be connected at the end. The writing is unique as it is like reading poetry or an old fairytale. It uses A LOT of imagery, but not in a way that gets old and drawn out. I\u2019m not sure if anything else like it exists, but for anyone who has read The Starless Sea and has found something similar, please let me know!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OtterSpace012\"> /u/OtterSpace012 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jg8llw/are_there_any_books_similar_to_the_starless_sea/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jg8llw/are_",

I can\u2019t say that I <em>enjoyed</em> it, per se, but it was excellent.</p> <p>This is a 1990s science fiction novel set in a far future where humanities colony worlds, long-sundered, are reconnecting. Though everyone involved is human, there are nevertheless differences that have popped up on different worlds. One of the more drastic changes was on a just-newly-contacted world, where newborn humans are completely sexless and genderless, each with the potential to develop male or female. At adolescence, one set of characteristics matures, and one atrophies. And, in about a third of the cases, neither set develops, and the person continues without any gender or sex.</p> <p>This book tells the story of Tedla, one of these \u201cneuters.\u201d Most of his world regards the neuters, more or less, as developmentally disabled; they\u2019re near-universally assumed to be slow, dull, and in need of guidance by gende",
