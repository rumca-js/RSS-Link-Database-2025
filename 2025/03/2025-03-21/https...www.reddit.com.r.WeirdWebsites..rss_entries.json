There is only one image there and it is actually 4 separate image files put together. Although the image looks old, the record of this website appears in the wayback machine after 2022-ish, making it even more strange. The images were original as I could not find any similar or identical image through google lens. Another strange thing is that there is another website named <a href=\"http://orteli.us\">orteli.us</a> , and the <a href=\"http://orteli.net\">orteli.net</a> website&#39;s title is also <a href=\"http://orteli.us\">orteli.us</a> but it is not a redirection to the other website. Why would someone make two identical websites? Maybe this has something to do with the name Ortelius, I guess.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry-Physics773\"> /u/Dry-Physics773 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://orteli.net\">[link]</a></spa",
