I have a majority of the \u201cmust-buy\u201d vr titles (HL: Alyx, H3vr, Into the Radius, SkyrimVR, etc.). I own pistol whip and am a pretty big fan but also leaning towards beat saber because of the rhythm aspect. I\u2019ve also taken a solid look at Underdogs and like the idea. Also thinking about Vertigo as I\u2019ve heard the 2nd is a gem. Of those three, what would be your picks? Or any other recommendations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stew_Padass\"> /u/Stew_Padass </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jht4kp/what_br_title_should_i_pickup_next/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jht4kp/what_br_title_should_i_pickup_next/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I tend to play in a handful of rooms - office, living room and bedroom - I will sometimes use a cable in the living room to the gaming PC when needed, but I&#39;m accustomed to the freedom of changing rooms when needed.</p> <p>It&#39;s really hard to compare this use case to what to expect from a headset like a beyond bigscreen 2 - like, I don&#39;t own steam vr tracking hubs, but it sounds like I might need them here?
