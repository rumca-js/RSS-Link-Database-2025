Now i&#39;ve bought a book about Django, i want to both study this and continue with some practice.</p> <p>Do you think it&#39;s ok? I&#39;ve also checked the doc but without a concrede project i find that you need to have something to use for (i mean for example, checking all the 30+ types of db fields isn&#39;t useful if you don&#39;t have a project to use them). So i thought that following a book may help me improve to understand better everything i do.</p> <p>So, to sumarize: to those starting with Python is a good method to start reading a Python book.
