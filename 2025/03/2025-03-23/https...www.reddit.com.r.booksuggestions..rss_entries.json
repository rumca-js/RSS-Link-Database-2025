When I had it, the cover was purple and featured children climbing over a fence. From what I remember, the story is about several children who move into an old mansion after something happens to their family; they are taken in by an uncle, aunt, or some distant relative they hardly know that lives there. The plot involves them having to climb over a wall to explore, discovering another house/people, and even venturing up into the woods/ mountains where mysterious rituals occur, with a voodoo doll playing some role, I remember the book was paaacked with weird stuff. I think the title might have started with \u201cThe Children Of\u2026\u201d or something similar, but there\u2019s so much happening in the story that it\u2019s all a bit confusing.

Unlike other books that tell you to \u2018just stop,\u2019 this one embraces overthinking and teaches how to turn it into a superpower.</p> <p>One idea that really hit me was setting a 10-minute timer where I\u2019m ONLY allowed to overthink and do nothing else. It sounds silly, but it\u2019s surprisingly freeing and lessens any unwanted overthinking significantly.</p> <p>So many examples of overthinking scenarios in the book felt like they were written <em>specifically</em> for me.

For those that have read this or are familiar with the plot, can you recommend anything similar that has the same fairytale retelling tie-in? </p> <p>I\u2019m not kidding when I say this has me in full \u201cnow I\u2019m going to go watch The Little Mermaid\u201d mode. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prettypenny-44\"> /u/prettypenny-44 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jho3y8/upon_a_starlit_tide_similar_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jho3y8/upon_a_starlit_tide_similar_books/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Yikes. Time to end the sausage fest.</p> <p>I&#39;d love your book recommendations by female authors, preferably released within the last 5-10 years. Fiction or nonfiction.
