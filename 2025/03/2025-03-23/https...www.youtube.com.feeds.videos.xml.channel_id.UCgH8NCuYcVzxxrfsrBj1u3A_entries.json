And when I say 'recent', I mean one that took place last month - which was when this was recorded as I'm currently on tour. I do like a full disclosure. \n\nFor birthday dedications of the Cameo kind: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe new Darkness album is released on the 28th March,   you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nSee The Darkness on tour across the UK this month,  tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nFrom mid March, watch more episodes of Justin Hawkins Rides Again and find Behind The Scenes footage from The Darkness On Tour on my Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview",
