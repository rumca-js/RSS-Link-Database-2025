        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve never used Docker before and honestly don&#39;t understand how it works. I know it sounds like it creates a bunch of virtual containers or something. I want to set up a set up a plex media server that only works on my local network inside Docker. I hear it&#39;s the best way to make it so that i can move my Plex database between Linux and Windows 11 with out having to keep scanning everything or lose all the move name edits etc that i made to my database. So would i just have to install the docker desktop app on both Windows 11 and OpenSuse Tumbleweed and then install Plex Media Server on the docker and that is pretty much it? I can then copy my plex data base to other hard drives and stuff to back it up and then move it between windows and linux? Most YouTube videos seem confusing and seem like they are doing a lot more than i am trying to do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TristinMays",
