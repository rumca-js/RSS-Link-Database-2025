I am still very fond of it because this is the thing I have beaten many games like pokemon, kirbys dreamland etc. on. My main game store sells gbc&#39;s in good condition for 100\u20ac wich although not really a price i like I think it&#39;s warranted because it comes in good condition it&#39;s tested and you get a four week warranty. I had recently had an important event in my life after wich I now feel I can reward myself. And I mean i can also just buy it but I have thought of traiding my gb in so I can get it for less. I will hover not trade it in if they offer me less than what I paid at least 50\u20ac wich I deam fair. </p> <p>But still I&#39;d like some sound advice what do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pleasant",

I&#39;m trying to weigh my options and wonder if it&#39;s justified to spend the money on the 4k CE even though I only have a 1080p display. is it worth the $150 for the filters that the CE offers even if its on a tv that may not take full capacity of the features? I plan on using it for PS1, PS2, Dreamcast, Saturn, and OG Xbox. Any advice on what to great is greatly appreciated.

So, I was wondering if there are any good retro game stores in the area that you would recommend.</p> <p>I have found one that is fairly close to Raunheim, but it doesn&#39;t have a website; so, I am not sure if it would be worth the trip: It is called Glitchless Game Store, Kaiserstra\u00dfe 72, 55116 Mainz. Does any of you know this place? Is it worth a visit?</p> <p>Do you have any recommendations that are easily accessible from Raunheim (possibly with train)?</p> <p>Thanks a bunch!</p> <p>P.s.: I collect mostly Sega Master System and Mega Drive, as well as Game Boy / Color / Advance games. But I love everything retro up until the 2000s.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rinceart\"> /u/Rinceart </a> <br/> <sp",

The game has such a spooky feel to it - an area gone to shit with the dwarves mutated and possessed by meteorite creatures, life all around the meteorite is dying, the blatant &#39;inspiration&#39; from the Alien movie, the misty area at the base of the tree... To me it&#39;s just so unlike anything of that era. Plus some banger tracks, though I think unfortunately the music gets bad after the mist area onwards.</p> <p>Travelling through the game is rewarding. The areas aren&#39;t too maze-y, I would say Zelda 2&#39;s castles can be harder to navigate. I liked getting to a new town, it has that breather feeling that a Resident Evil save room has, and always interesting to see what new stuff the shops have. </p> <p>I did have to consult a walkthrough a couple of time",

Turns out, there are four different Ultimate 2C versions, and the one I got (2.4G/Bluetooth) doesn\u2019t support Switch\u2014while another version (Bluetooth for Switch) does. If both are Bluetooth, why can\u2019t we just update the firmware? If the hardware is different, why name them the same?! Also, 8BitDo used to have open firmware updates and Linux(?) support\u2014now they have three different software tools just to update devices, hidden firmware files, and such confusing product names that even a veteran PC user/gamer can end up buying the wrong product</p> <hr/> <p>So i&#39;ll start off by stating that I probably bought the wrong controller than I intended because 8bitdo just couldn&#39;t do proper product naming schemes?

But speaking of Konami related matters, I wanted to look into Metal Gear as many of the characters from the MSX games look like they were modeled after actors such as Sylvester Stallone and Sean Connery.</p> <p>I guess the point I am trying to make is that I wanted to understand how the concept of copyrights worked back then in those days of gaming as what I was lookin",
