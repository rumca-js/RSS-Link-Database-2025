I was browsing Amazon hoping to find my next obsession in fantasy fiction when I noticed this trend of modern fantasy written in the last 5-10 years where every other damn book, even by different authors, has a title like \u201cTHING of THIS and THAT\u201d. More and more scrolled by and I found my mind immediately dismissing every book with this kind of title. I blame both George RR Martin and Sara J Maas. A Song of Ice and Fire, A Court of Thorns and Roses, House of Flame and Shadows, what\u2019s next? Kingdom of Shits and Giggles? When will this trend end? Does this get on anyone else\u2019s nerves?</p> <p>I await the comments of thoughts and opinions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Effective-Effort-587\"> /u/Effective-Effort-587 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jhq2q0/things_of_this_and_that_an_exhausting_modern_tre",
