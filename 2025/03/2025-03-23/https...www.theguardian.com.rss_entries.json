Something that says, quietly, deliciously, \u201cWelcome home!\u201d The house is cold and empty, and I have a fancy for ham with cauliflower cheese. A dinner that I make so rarely, if ever, and yet for which I have something of a soft spot. The nudge came from a quick trip to the shops and seeing from the most perfect cauli I had seen in ages, its cream-coloured curds crisp and without blemish, complete with its crown of green leaves.</p><p>The sauce was left to blip quietly on the stove, seasoned with bay leaves and a fistful of parsley, a sauce just thick enough to see the knubbly clouds of cauliflower beneath. I cooked a ham hock to eat with it, then got the idea to tear the meat from the bones and stir it into the cheese sauce, using some of the cooking broth in place of milk. A side dish instantly became a full dinner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com",

Cugno (chocolatier to 2023\u2019s <em>Wonka</em> film) makes eggs like no one else. They are heavy \u2013 the thickest I\u2019ve ever come across and the opposite of what I wrote of last week (\u2018Simple milk chocolate eggs\u2019). Her latest work of art is the smoky, caramelised almond and hazelnut praline egg with bits of chilli and salted caramel (other versions are available, but all on similar lines, including vegan). These are my ideal eggs in terms of inclusions. I get excited just looking at them.</p><p>Cugno makes every one, so they are limited edition and start at \u00a344 (the eggs are sent out a week before Easter). If they\u2019ve sold out, go on the waiting list for next year. They\u2019re worth it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/23/notes-on-ch",

One is made up of Westminster reporters and commentators. Their verdict about who has \u201cwon\u201d PMQs influences the overall judgment about whether a leader has forward momentum or is going nowhere. The other critical audience is made up of MPs.
