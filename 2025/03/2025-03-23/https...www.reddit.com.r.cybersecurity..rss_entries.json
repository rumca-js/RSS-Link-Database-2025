I do have pretty good knowledge, but I have seen various posts about the actual test being really harder than the final assessment. Considering I already have a lot of experience academically as well as with hands-on labs, do you think I should rely on other materials for getting certified.

I\u2019m interested in the role because it aligns better with my career goals in cybersecurity. However, accepting this new role would involve taking about a 10% pay cut from my current salary.</p> <p>Has anyone faced a similar situation before? Would you recommend taking the pay cut now for potentially better career growth down the line, or is it better to hold out for something that matches or exceeds my current salary?</p> <p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/232Will\"> /u/232Will </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1jhrh7i/advice_needed_should_i_take_an_iam_administrator/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecur",
