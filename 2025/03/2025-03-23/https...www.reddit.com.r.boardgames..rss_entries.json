And I can tell you, we never argued so much about the game, like today.</p> <p>There is the character, Jim Longhair, and the card, Sidekick. When Jim&#39;s player AC and RC swaps, he can swap the other players AC and RC.</p> <p>When a character with an equipment card Sidekick becomes AC, the opponent&#39;s AC becomes the target of an attack.</p> <p>It&#39;s Jim&#39;s player turn. Jim is AC, the player swapped, and Jim&#39;s RC with sidekick on the table, became AC.</p> <p>Soooo, which effect we play first? The swapping opponents cards or the attack?</p> <p>By the rules of original Bang The Duel it goes:</p> <p>Current player AC</p> <p>Opponent player AC</p> <p>Current player RC</p> <p>Opponent player RC</p> <p>But we can&#39;t set on which effect is the first, because we argue that Jim is AC, but the other character just became AC.
