With how Steam OS is coming along and with how the current XBox performed, is there any chance MS would actually go for this? Help Valve push for anti cheat support from games, maybe arrange some deal where they get a cut from store sales and ship a next gen XBox with Steam OS? I feel like all the talk about kernel level anti cheat needing a fixed, verifiable kernel could be solved in that constellation.</p> <p>This probably wouldn&#39;t help to run Valorant or such on other Linux Desktops, but I found the idea Interesting and not totally out of the question.</p> <p>What do you say?

Im running full AMD with 9800X3D and 9070XT on a B850 motherboard </p> <p>Tried to run Doom Eternal, and the game just fucks itself. Screen freezes and/or is really slow. It was a nightmare getting into setting and turn off ray tracing, which evidently was the problem.. (tried turning it back on when it was running smoothly but it crashed.) I havent tested any other games with raytracing so far, but is this a driver issue? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable-Football-9\"> /u/Miserable-Football-9 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jhwzwu/doom_eternal_raytracing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jhwzwu/doom_eternal_raytracing/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Every time I share my screen, the frametimes become wildly unstable, so although MangoHUD shows 80\u201390 FPS, it feels visually like I&#39;m running at only around 10 FPS due to severe frametime spikes\u2014even though the FPS itself only drops by roughly 25%. When I&#39;m not screensharing, the games run just as smoothly as they did before switching to LM. My specs are: Ryzen 5 5500, RTX 2060 Super, 64GB RAM, SSD NVMe.</p> <p>In addition, whenever I&#39;m running a graphically intensive game and use Alt+TAB, the audio for others on Discord turns choppy and robotic (even if the Discord window remains open), but only when the game is on heavily GPU or CPU load (for instance, lightweight 2D games look normal).
