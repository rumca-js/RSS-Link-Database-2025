Douglas brings up he overheard one of these men mention something about \u201cCRS\u201d. The two men share a glance. Then one of them says, \u201cYou know, I envy you.

It a low-budget film that follows the aftermath of the discovery that the entire population of a small desert town on the Arizona/Mexico border has mysteriously and violently vanished. The only clues come from a roll of 35mm photos later discovered that tell a story. The pics are super freaky and creepy; and the last two photos, geez. No spoilers here except that I really liked the film.

From JCVD punching out a snake to him taking out a helicopter with a shotgun, to Wilford Brimley blowing up his house with a bow and arrow while riding away on horseback is equal parts awesome and wtf.
