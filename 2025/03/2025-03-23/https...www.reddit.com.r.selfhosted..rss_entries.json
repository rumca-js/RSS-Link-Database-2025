I am getting started with Proxmox in earnest now, and I want to start learning containers within it so I can start to deploy some of my most frequently used services inside of containers on Proxmox. When it comes to Obsidian, what are best practices for that on Proxmox? Are there any pre-built containers for it I can start with?

Just wrapped up a 3-day full immersion into the world of NAS and Unraid - turned an old laptop into a NAS, set up Unraid, and got NextCloud, Immich, and Tailscale running. Pretty fun ride so far, esp for someone who doens&#39;t have an IT background!</p> <p>Now that things are up and running, I\u2019ve got a couple of questions:</p> <p><strong>1. What steps would you take to tighten security?</strong><br/> The NAS will mainly be used for personal data storage, and maybe occasionally to share files with family (this latter is not a core use case).</p> <p><strong>2. How do you handle backups?</strong><br/> I\u2019ve got 2 HDDs (parity), and I just uploaded ~120GB of media to Immich. During one of my earlier setup attempts, I accidentally nuked the container, so I\u2019d really love to avoid that happening again. Any tips for keeping things safe? External drive vs app data backed up to a separate folder?</p> <p>Appreciate any advice - your help and your tip",

Webpage itself is also hosted on my own server. When Google Domains shut down last year and transferred to Squarespace, the first time I created an account with Squarespace I accidentally disabled WHOIS privacy. I have since re-enabled it, but ever since then I have been getting spam calls to my cell phone from phony-sounding companies trying to sell me web development services, thinking that my website is for a business (it&#39;s not, it&#39;s my personal page and I have no intention of monetizing it). Anyone experienced this before? Or know how to get these spam calls to stop? It&#39;s a different caller each time and one call does not seem to be related to the other, so telling them I am not interested in any service is futile.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vinaypundith\"> /u/vinaypundith </a> ",
