        "description": "The stealth gaming genre has a long and hallowed history with greats like Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, and Thief. While sequels for those titles remain MIA, we're still getting some significant remakes and new IPs that evolve on their fundamentals.\n\nOf course, there's far more to look forward to in 2025 and beyond. Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei takes us to a brand new setting with some intriguing new tools. Commandos: Origins marks a return for Jack O'Hara and his crew, exploring their early days and formation. Monaco 2 looks to bring its brand of co-op heisting and creative problem-solving to the forefront.\n\nThere's also Assassin's Creed Shadows, which impresses with its parkour and assassinations, and the upcoming Skin Deep, which combines sci-fi and immersive sim shenanigans into an over-the-top package. Check out some of the biggest stealth games coming soon.",
