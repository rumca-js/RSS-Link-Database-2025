Here\u2019s how it would work: 1. A real estate image is uploaded and classified via Roboflow based on a user-trained library (e.g. shot type, room type, style). 2. It\u2019s matched to similar reference images that have feature ratings (like lighting, hue, contrast, edges) from 1\u20135, plus an overall score. 3. AI (via GPT-4) generates prompts to describe what each rating looks like for that property type, then scores the uploaded image across those features and gives feedback on how to improve it. 4. If the overall rating is below 3, it moves into an editing workflow. 5. AI generates specific Photoshop edit instructions per feature (e.g. reduce saturation, adjust white balance), which are sent to a UXP plugin that auto-applies them. 6. The edited image is re-evaluated until it meets the quality threshold.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to figure out: \u2022 Does anything ",

Reason behind this idea is i am a beginner in tech, and love to learn programming through working on projects. So for almost every line of code i had to note down the meaning of the keywords or the workflows or the use cases by commenting. By the end more than code lines there were comments. So implemented this to have a note icon for a clean look. Would be really helpful if you guys went through the README where i have mentioned all about the extension, please try it out and provide ratings and reviews!</p> </div><!--",

After few weeks of building I\u2019m here to share with you our last discovery from our TypewrAIter experiment: We recently got listed on There\u2019s An AI For That (TAAFT) without even submitting our tool. Someone just\u2026 found it useful. That\u2019s it. No launch. No upvote begging. No optimized comment thread strategy. Just organic discovery. So? Today, 18% of our traffic is coming from There\u2019s An AI For That (TAAFT). Compare that to Product Hunt\u2014just 2%, despite all the hype. All the tips. All the guides.</p> <p>what that tells us? 1. People are actively exploring alternatives to the mainstream launch: Communities and tools like TAAFT are becoming real discovery engines\u2014because they\u2019re built for users searching for actual solutions, not launch hype. 2. You don\u2019t need to yell into the void. Sometimes it\u2019s better to quietly build something useful and let your users do the talking (or listing) for you. That kind of validation is gold. 3.
