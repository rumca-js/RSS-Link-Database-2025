Run OpenWebUI on your own VPS with Hostinger (code networkchuck10): https://hostinger.com/networkchuckvps \n\n\nAI is getting expensive\u2026but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I found a way to access all the major AI models\u2013 ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, even Grok \u2013 without paying for multiple expensive subscriptions. Not only do I get unlimited access to the newest models, but I can also share it with my entire team, my wife, my kids\u2013 all while keeping full control over what they can access. Better security, more privacy, and a ton of features\u2026 this might be the best way to use AI.\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\n\ud83d\udd27 Self-host OpenWebUI (On-Prem Installation Guide): https://youtu.be/JJ_0-pAOIEk\n\ud83c\udf10 Turn OpenWebUI into a website (Domain + SSL Setup): https://youtu.be/BdH_yR_J3FQ\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:11 - The Plan (What is OpenWebUI?)\n2:20 - The Cloud Option\n5:02 - Install OpenWebUI\n6:18 - Connecting ChatGPT API\n9:06 - How Much Does This Cost?\n13:06 - Using LiteLLM to do MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Joi",
