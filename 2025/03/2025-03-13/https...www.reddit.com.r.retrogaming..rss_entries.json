My biggest appeal of a retrotink 4k is the advanced CRT shaders, while the scanlines offered from the framemeister look great on ps2 games, I feel like the shaders in the tink4k would absolutely blow it away.</p> <p>What do you guys think ? Is it a good idea to sell the framemeister and get a tink4k in this case or it will be huge waste ?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kodatarule\"> /u/kodatarule </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/com",

This leads me to a related question I want to ask.</p> <p>Obviously, playing Street Fighter 2 on an original arcade cabinet isn&#39;t practical or feasible for most people today. Therefore, would the next best thing to do be to play the arcade version on an emulator? Should that be prioritized over playing the SNES version? </p> <p>And speaking of the SNES port, does it have better difficulty balance than the arcade version? If you were to set both the arcade version and the SNES version to the same difficulty level, would the arcade version still be more difficult with more aggressive AI (you know, because they wanted you to spend more quarters)?</p> ",

But, I spent the last few days grinding and replaying it over and over, and I finally managed to beat it.</p> <p>I did this using regular hardware, no emulation. Multiple failed runs, maybe 20+? For this run, I wanted to beat the game using the Valkyrie. I looked around YouTube and most of the runs was done with the elf. It&#39;s pretty clear that speed is the number one stat in the game. Faster movement speed means less time in each level, which means less time for generators to pump out more monsters.</p> <p>It was clear to me at this point that speed and magic bomb power makes the game much easier. That&#39;s why the elf is so good. Highest speed and good bomb power helps alot. That&#39;s probably why the wiza",
