Mostly sent it just so we could giggle about how it would drive us insane. She jokingly said, \u201cfor my birthday I want you to read this book and annotate it with your thoughts while you read it.\u201d I immediately did just that. Now it has become a birthday tradition that I buy a book I know we will not like and then I annotate it as I read it and even tape in little memes and reaction pics as I go. Other friends have started to take turns after me so we all get to collaborate before we hand it off to her. It\u2019s time to pick a new book and I was hoping to get some recs. Normally she finds one that she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d like and sends it to me, but she left it up to me this year. We are leaning towards Get in My Swamp: An Ogre Love Story, mostly because she loves Shrek. In the past we have done Haunting Adeline, Credence, ",

I&#39;ve never really come across any and I feel like this would be an ultimate forbidden romance trope (I could be most definitely wrong). I did read a book where the fml is I think a siren and she gets set up with a merman but this is like an arranged marriage type situation but it doesn&#39;t really go on for more than a chapter and the two characters and the merman is just mentioned to basically threaten the fml. But anyway never heard of a siren and a mermaid fall in love so... here we are.</p> <p>The only way I can think of this being possible is through fanfics but I don&#39;t really mind. It came into my brain like 5 minutes ago and it&#39;s a very specific craving now. So if you know any please do lmk.

What I appreciate most about them is the closeness you feel towards the main character and how strong their personalities are. I also just tend to like more folk horror-esq novels but thhat&#39;s not like a genre requirement or anything, haha.

I usually tend to enjoy fiction, particularly thrillers but I am open to exploring other genres if the books are gripping enough. More about my situation - I&#39;m looking to take a break from social media and TV to improve my mental health, and hoping to fill my evenings with reading instead. I have a pretty demanding job so I&#39;m not looking for a binge read, but more of a slow and steady read that I can enjoy over the next few days. I&#39;ve noticed that if I read in small doses everyday (few pages before bed each night) I quickly lose interest and can&#39;t even finish half the book. So, I&#39;m looking for book options that are gripping enough that I will keep wanting to read everyday but I should also be able to keep it down after a few pages. I don&#39;t want to stay up all night trying to devour the book all at once. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
