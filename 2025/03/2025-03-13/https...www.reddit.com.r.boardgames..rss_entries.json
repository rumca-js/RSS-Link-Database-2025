I&#39;ve been a longtime lurker reading comments in this sub for a while deciding on a table for our dining room. We ultimately decided on Allplay Jasper:</p> <ul> <li>Jasper 3.0 Dark Walnut with Topper</li> <li>Magnetic Cup Holder</li> <li>Magnetic Tray</li> <li>Topper Storage Box</li> <li>Table Extension</li> </ul> <p>Overall, we are satisfied with our purchase. No major issues. It did take many months for the Topper Storage box to show up after delays. We also slightly regret getting the table extension, but the other accessories have been fine. It definitely is more of a budget table, but it fit our space well. We have a Wyrmwood coffee table that&#39;s definitely crafted better in comparison. We have a full video of our assembly &amp; review here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBY_38eMbA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBY_38eMbA</a></p> <p>",

If the check is unsuccesful and both player are tied for first, do they always sum the first and second place and divide it by the number of tied players? or do they only use the points for the first place since they are tied for it and the third player would win second place (1 point)? </p> <p>can you also explain for succesful checks? For example, three players, the check is succesfull, all player have the same influence. Would you sum the first, second and third place and divide by three? same scenario, but in this case, one player is in the lead and the other two are tied, do you sum the second and third place and divide by two?</p> <p>this is probably a dumb question but i just wanted to be absolutely sure. The game is pretty clean all considering.</p> <p>thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/franciscomegre\"> /u/franciscomegre </a>",
