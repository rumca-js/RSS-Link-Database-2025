As part of its announcements ahead of this year&#39;s upcoming Game Developers Conference (GDC), the company said that it&#39;s implementing an 80/20 revenue share model for games on the Galaxy Store. Previously, Samsung had a 70/30 sharing model, wherein it took 30 percent of an app&#39;s revenue. The new model also applies to games built on the company&#39;s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-cloud-gaming-platform-smart-tv-155226529.html\">cloud gaming platform</a>, which allows players to stream games without downloading them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By adopting the new model, Samsung is undercutting Google, which implements a 70/30 split.
