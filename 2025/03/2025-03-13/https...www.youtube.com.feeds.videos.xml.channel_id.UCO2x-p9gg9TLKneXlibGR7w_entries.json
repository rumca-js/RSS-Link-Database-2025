From there, I dive into the iPhone SE lineup, including knock-off versions from shady eBay sellers. And of course, I put them all up against the latest so-called budget model, the iPhone 16e, which has been heavily criticized for being a terrible value. Is the iPhone 16e really Apple\u2019s worst budget phone ever, or have past models been just as bad? Watch to find out!\n\n0:00 Unboxing ever",
