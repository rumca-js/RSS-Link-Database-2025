I&#39;ve been using rankingCoach and have managed to improve the visibility of my website quite significantly but I really want to be further up the rankings in Google. My business is a bit niche (personalised wedding cake toppers) but I&#39;m currently showing up on page 3 of a non-local-area search. I&#39;ve fixed all my headers, tried to include as many keywords as I can in the blurb on my front page, filled in alt text, made profiles on directories like Yelp and Google Business etc but I&#39;m stumped as to where to turn next to increase my visibility.</p> <p>Any guidance gratefully received.
