        "description": "<p>A pulsating, often deeply frustrating evening ended with Ibrox shaking to its foundations and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho consoling his Fenerbahce players on the pitch. They had erased Rangers\u2019 first-leg advantage through two goals from Sebastian Szymanski and the tie\u2019s momentum swung in both directions during a frantic spell of extra time. It took a shoot-out to spark delirium, Jack Butland saving from Dusan Tadic and Fred before Mert Hakan Yandas spooned over to ensure Rangers will face Athletic Bilbao in the last eight.</p><p>\u201cIn the eye of a Rangers storm,\u201d read a banner displayed before kick-off, displaying the logos of their four vanquished group stage opponents but tactfully omitting Fenerbahce for now. The job was only half-done but there was the tantalising prospect that an early tornado could all but complete it. Mourinho\u2019s players\u2019 had simply not dealt with Rangers\u2019 intensity in the first leg and a pulsating Ibrox was evidently ready to provoke a repeat.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theg",
