He was an unassuming, polite man who would engage with me kindly whenever I strayed into his vegetable patch or workshop, telling me the names of vegetables and tools he used to &#39;Fix clocks&#39;. My mum used to bring him the odd plate of food and help with his shopping occasionally, as you would in a community living in a big old house.
