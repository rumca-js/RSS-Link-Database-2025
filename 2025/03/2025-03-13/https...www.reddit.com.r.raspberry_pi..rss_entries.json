Looking online, the guide at <a href=\"https://www.thedigitalpictureframe.com/how-to-build-the-best-raspberry-pi-digital-picture-frame-with-bookworm-wayland-2025-edition-pi-2-3-4-5/\">https://www.thedigitalpictureframe.com/how-to-build-the-best-raspberry-pi-digital-picture-frame-with-bookworm-wayland-2025-edition-pi-2-3-4-5/</a> seems great. </p> <p>However during install, I&#39;m stuck at the installation of picframe (pip install picframe). I get the error that I cannot build wheel for pillow_heif. It seems that is because libheif (heif.h) is missing. I&#39;ve tried installing wheel and pi_hief separately, but that hasn&#39;t solved the problem. </p> <p>I&#39;ve searched online and can&#39;t seem to figure out how to solve this. Am I doing something dumb? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/guy",

Each analog signal is run through a voltage devider that brings the voltage down by an inverse gain of 11 so that our max voltage on our nodes (24V) can safely enter the arduino. The arduinos are then each connected through an I2C bus to a Raspberry Pi5 to send voltage data to the RPi. The voltage data will eventually be put into a Voltage vs Time graph and displayed on the monitor connected to the Raspberry Pi.</p> <p>Progress: Have two arduinos set up on the bus for testing currently able to send back voltage data to the Raspberry Pi with .01 precision and within 50 mV of expected voltage. Raspberry Pi allows you to select which arduino and then which node you would like to pull data from. Next step is to set up a broadcasting system where the Raspberry Pi broadcasts a nodeID to all the arduinos at the same time. If the arduino contains the node bro",
