Currently, AI is more useful in real-world scenarios, but two new papers suggest that AI might be used to propel quantum computing development forward. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper 1: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08148-8\nPaper 2: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14647\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newslet",
