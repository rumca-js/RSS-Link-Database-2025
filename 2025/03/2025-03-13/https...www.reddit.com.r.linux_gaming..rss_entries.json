What I like about the Steam Deck is having a Decky plugin for How Long To Beat and being able to change the artwork of non Steam games. Is there a way to do something similar with Lutris? Or maybe Heroic (never used it)? </p> <p>Also Lutris auto populates some artwork for a game based on the Name/Identifier, but it runs into issues. For example, God of War populates the OG GoW from the 90s not 2018 and I can&#39;t figure out how to make it populate 2018. I know I could manually change the artwork, but it would be great if there was a way to do it automatically.
