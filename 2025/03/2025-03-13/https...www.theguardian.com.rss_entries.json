The Spurs manager had been hoping that someone would step up to save their season and his salvation arrived in the shape of Wilson Odobert, with a little bit of help from James Maddison.</p><p>When the England midfielder made it 2-0 early in the second half to add to Odobert\u2019s well-taken first goal for the club, it looked like Postecoglou\u2019s side were cruising to a last-eight showdown with Eintracht Frankfurt. This being Tottenham, however, things are never that simple and a mistake from Odobert allowed Peer Koopmeiners to level the scores on aggregate with 20 minute to play to leave the home crowd fearing the worst. But Odobert kept Postecoglou\u2019s hopes of ending the season with some silverware alive \u2013 and perhaps even saved his job \u2013 when the Frenchman swept home at the end of a flowing move instigated by Maddison to send Spurs into the quarter-finals of the Europa League for the first time since 2013.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fo",

How will you fare?</p><p>The Thursday quiz was all set to announce a massive expansion, which would have, no doubt, generated a huge number of jobs and benefitted the whole economy of the UK. Sadly, despite almost certainly being more profitable than many a faded football club currently languishing in the lower reaches of the Premier League, the Thursday quiz has been quite unable to convince the government to also stump up a load of taxpayer cash as part of the deal to regenerate the neighbourhood. So we will just have to stick to the tried and trusted format of 15 topical, general knowledge and pop culture questions laden with a few jokes, however shabby the surroundings are.
