Manufactrurer Recertified has 2 year warranty, so that alone might be worth it, but I&#39;ve heard horror stories about companies like WD and Seagate not even checking or doing anything when they get return drives and just immediately turning around and selling them as &quot;recertified&quot;. Whereas maybe Server Parts Deals themselves put at least a <em>little</em> more effort into making sure their &quot;refurbished&quot; drives are good to go? Obviously, it might just all be a guessing game, but wondering if anyone has any firsthand experience or advice. </li> <li>If I have a basic 2-bay Sabrent HDD dock, is there any issue using both an 18TB and 20TB drive at the same time?",
