Still learning a lot. </p> <p>I currently have multiple Macs set to back up with Time Machine to a TrueNAS SMB share on my local network, and they&#39;ve been backing up for about a month. They&#39;re currently configured to point to the local network, so they only back up when they&#39;re physically on the network. But backups are fast, and work well.</p> <p>I recently set up Tailscale, which has been working great. I&#39;d like to also configure the computers to back up remotely, in addition to locally, but I don&#39;t want to duplicate my storage. If I configure a second destination to be the Tailscale address, is Time Machine smart enough to know they&#39;re the same, and to choose the local route when available?</p> <p>My current guess is no, and I&#39;d end up with duplicate data, since it would see each as a separate destination.

Jellyfin, Threadfin, and probably 2-3 others. I need to run a few commands on the containers. Mostly it involves using <code>curl</code> to download my self-signed SSL certificate, and then adding it to <code>ca-certificates</code> so that each container trusts my cert.</p> <p>The issue becomes, I&#39;d have to create a new Dockerfile to add the instructions. And by doing this, I&#39;m no longer getting the image directly from the developer on Docker Hub, I&#39;m making my own.</p> <p>So if that developer comes out with a new update in two days, I have to keep track of when an update is pushed, and then re-build my image yet again to get the changes pushed by the developer in the new update, plus the added commands to import my certificates.</",
