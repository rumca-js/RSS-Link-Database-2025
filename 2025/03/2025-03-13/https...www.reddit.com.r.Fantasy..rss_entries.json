        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all. Looking for new book recommendations. My favorite fantasy books of all time have been A Song of Ice and Fire. I love the story, even though I know it may never be finished. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking for stories similar. The following things are the main reason why I\u2019ve grown to love ASOIAF:</p> <ol> <li>The lore. Family history, geographical history, political history, etc in these books have made me love it more than other books. There is so much detail. </li> <li>The important artifacts. Ancestral swords, Valyrian steel, etc. Dark Sister and Blackfyre peaked my interest above all as they were two ancestral swords of house Targaryen that have been lost with time.</li> <li>Multiple lands. The story takes place in different continents, different atmospheres and different cultures. </li> </ol> <p>Other books I\u2019ve read and enjoyed have been the Red Rising series (currently on Morning Star), the Mistborn trilogy and The Will of the Many.</p> <p>Thanks!",
