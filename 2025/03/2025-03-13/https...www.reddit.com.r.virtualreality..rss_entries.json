One second its clean and running smooth, then ten seconds later it&#39;s at 4 FPS and on the verge of giving me a seizure. I&#39;ve tried linking through both Air &amp; Cable.

Living in a shared space in LA, I&#39;m not going to be able to switch that stuff out or run wired. Hoping that&#39;s not the only option. Would be so dumb if so.
