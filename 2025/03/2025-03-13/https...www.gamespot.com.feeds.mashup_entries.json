Below, we look back at how it continues to endure and what continues to make it a powerful, relevant classic.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">After 30 years, I still often find myself thinking about Fiona's Forest in <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/chrono-trigger/\">Chrono Trigger</a>, and one of the scenes that captures what makes the game so enduring for me.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's a late-game moment after you complete one of Chrono Trigger's few but meaningful side quests. In it, you meet a woman named Fiona, who has dedicated herself to planting a forest around her small cottage. Her husband has gone away to war as the local kingdom, Guardia, takes on a powerful magician known as the Fiendlord and his army of demi-human creatures. When you find her, Fiona worries over his safety and laments that while the couple had hoped to grow the grove together, she can't tend it on her own.</p><a href=\"",

Are you looking for something akin to a slasher, a ghost story, an alien invasion, or perhaps something harder to pin down?

While the 3v3 first-person shooter received fairly positive feedback after its initial release, Mountaintop Studios says that a steady decline in players and a lack of funds contributed to its demise.</p><p>Studio CEO Nate Mitchell explained that the studio explored every possible avenue it could to keep the developer and the game afloat, but after exhausting all of its options, the writing was sadly on the wall for Spectre Divide and its team. \"The industry is in a tough spot right now,\" Mitchell said.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6465049\" data-src=\"/videos/spectre-divide-launch-day-animated-trailer-play-free-now/2300-6465049/\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\" data-video-start=\"0\">          <iframe height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscree",

They might have been better at the game back then, but today, Dahmen claims he's the best.</p><p>\"I still have met no one who can beat me at Mario Kart N64.

Now, the network is adding a second island in Fornite Creative, which will be called ESPN Basketball Island. The two ESPN islands will be connected through in-game portals, and the latest attraction is adding a few new basketball-inspired minigames.</p><p>The first new minigame, Dunk to Win, can be seen in the Basketball Island launch trailer below. It's essentially another riff on Capture the Flag, except the flag is now a basketball. Once players have the ball, they have to avoid the other team's defenders and make their way to the net to score a slam dunk.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDGuh11L8bk\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDGuh11L8bk\" height=\"100%\" w",
