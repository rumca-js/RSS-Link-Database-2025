These students had no prior experience with Etsy, design, or e-commerce, and they didn\u2019t have a big budget to invest. But what they had was curiosity, willingness to learn, and a few hours a week to dedicate to something that could change their financial future.</p> <p>The Plan: A Simple, Low-Cost Etsy Strategy To make the process as easy as possible for them.</p> <p>I Gave them ready-made designs \u2013 I provided high-quality, pre-made digital designs they could sell instantly. Provided access to Canva Pro \u2013 I secured a 3-year Canva Pro access for them at a cheap price, so they could create and customize their own products without expensive design software.
