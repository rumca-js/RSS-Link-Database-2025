The Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon Endurance were unaffected. NASA has rescheduled the launch for March 14 at 7:03 p.m. EDT. The four-member team, led by NASA astronaut Anne McClain, will relieve Crew-9 upon arrival at the ISS. The delay was necessary to ensure the safe release of the rocket at liftoff.",

The formations, averaging 52 feet in height and spanning 900 square miles, offer new insights into the force of the ancient tsunami and its global impact. Scientists suggest these findings can help model future asteroid-driven tsunamis, aiding in planetary defense efforts. Variations in ripple shapes further reveal how the tsunami moved through different underwater landscapes.",

Previously, it was believed that quantum control weakens as kinetic energy increases. However, as per reports, unexpected order has been observed in rubidium-strontium collisions, suggesting that quantum interactions persist in warmer conditions. This discovery could significantly impact both fundamental research and quantum technology, potentially leading to more efficient quantum computing.",
