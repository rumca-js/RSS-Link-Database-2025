I have a weird habit: I use both a physical book and the audiobook at the same time. It makes it easier for me to read in English. And this method really brought the novel to life.</p> <p>The last half of the novel, especially the final 20-30 pages, was so tense I couldn\u2019t put it down. The ending wasn&#39;t sad at all, but I couldn\u2019t stop crying. The last few passages, where Scout was telling their story from Boo Radley&#39;s perspective, had me sobbing like a child.
