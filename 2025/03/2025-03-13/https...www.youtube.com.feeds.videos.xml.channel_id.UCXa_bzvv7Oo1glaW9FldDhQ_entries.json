        "description": "Ready at Dawn\u2019s The Order 1886 impressed everyone with its jaw-dropping visuals and staggering attention to detail when it was released for the PS4 back in 2015. With its never-before-seen level of fidelity and everyone\u2019s favourite third-person shooter gameplay, it was set to be a smash hit but it ended up going down as one of the biggest flops of that generation. \n\nBut was the negative reception justified, or was it a game that was ahead of its time? Now that a decade has passed since then, we take a look back at The Order 1886 and try to rate it against modern contemporaries while keeping in mind the current trends of the AAA industry.",

        "description": "Gone are the days when every game was consistently released in a finished, 100% playable state. Commonplace are day one patches and lengthy roadmaps of post-release updates. \n\nWith the snowballing costs of development, and thus rising retail prices for gamers, this practice is becoming increasingly unacceptable, if it were ever acceptable to begin with. That said, numerous games that release in in a subpar state, whether laced with game-breaking bugs or harboring a lack of content, receive updates which improve the experience so much that they deserve a second chance. \n\nNot only resolving technical issues, fresh content, or new story elements, the updates these games receive, in some cases, transforms the experience entirely.",
