        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nA minority shareholder in Ubisoft is planning a protest against the company, claiming it's \"horribly mismanaged.\" The shareholder alleges that Ubisoft has not been transparent and is \"hiding information,\" including partnerships with the Savvy Group, and holding talks with Microsoft, EA, and others regarding possibly selling Ubisoft IP (maybe that's the only way we'll get a new Splinter Cell). In other news, EA's skate. is in closed alpha testing, but that isn't stopping them from selling microtransactions. EA claims this is to test the store feature to make sure it all works at launch. Mmm hmm. Any purchases made during this testing period will basically be converted back into in-game currency at launch. And speaking of EA, in positive news, Hazelight Studios' co-op Split Fiction not only is getting rave reviews, but sales as well. The game has sold 1 million copies in just 48 hours.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
