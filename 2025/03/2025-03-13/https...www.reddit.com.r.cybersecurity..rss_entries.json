Most people are overly confident in their ability to spot a fake, even when they\u2019re wrong.</p> <p>StyleGAN2, has advanced deepfake technology where facial images can be manipulated in extraordinary detail. This means that fake profiles on social media or dating apps can look more convincing than ever.</p> <p>What&#39;s your take on this?</p> <p>Source: <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/9/1/tyad011/7205694?searchresult=1#415793263\">https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/9/1/tyad011/7205694?searchresult=1#415793263</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sunitha_Sundar_5980\"> /u/Sunitha_Sundar_5980 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comm",
