I colorized, restored, and created a sound design for this video of Pennsylvania in the 1930s, focusing on the town of Etna. This unique footage offers a complete tour of the city, capturing the essence of daily life during this era. From bustling streets lined with historic buildings to workers engaged in their trades, the video provides a vivid look at how people lived, worked, and interacted in a rapidly evolving industrial America. Beyond daily routines, this footage also showcases the entertainment and leisure activities that defined the period. Whether it’s children playing in the streets, families gathering for social events, or glimpses  recreational spots,
