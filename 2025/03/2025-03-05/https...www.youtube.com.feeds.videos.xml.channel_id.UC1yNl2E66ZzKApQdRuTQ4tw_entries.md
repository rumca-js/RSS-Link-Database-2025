Last year, Jonathan Oppenheim’s theory of post-quantum gravity was the only theory that made it into my Best of 2024 summary. Post-quantum gravity is one of the most interesting theories for merging quantum physics with gravity, which in turn is one of the most important problems in physics. Now, researchers say they’ve come up with a way to test the theory, though technology needs to advance before that test is possible. In this video I explain why I think it’s likely that post-quantum gravity will be falsified.
