The only games that I&#39;ve played so far that look fine are blade and sorcery, and the walking dead. But bootstrap island is pixelated if I look at anything that&#39;s not right next to me, and metro awakening and into the radius 2 are really muddy and blurry. Even the text while loading into metro awakening is real blurry. Metro awakening and into the radius 2 seems to look better if I turn the in game resolution scaling to the max but then it runs terrible. But I can turn the resolution scaler to the max in bootstrap island but it has absolutely no difference. I&#39;ve followed tutorials and used recommended settings for the meta quest app, oculus debug tool, and steamVR, nothings seemed to make a difference.

Your enthusiasm and feedback have been our driving force, inspiring us to push the boundaries of what eye-tracking can do for immersive experiences.</p> <p>Over the past three years, we at Inseye have been on a mission to develop eye-tracking technology that’s not only powerful but also highly accessible and simple to integrate into immersive experiences. We started from rethinking hardware used for eye-tracking —keeping it simple, cost-effective, and reliable—then paired it with AI software ensuring accuracy in real-world conditions.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I got slime trackers and realized that they are not compatible with my router. I have the puppis s1 for my quest 3. The reason I got it was because it was dedicated for pcvr(i did see huge improvement) and it doesn&#39;t need a ethernet cable running from the main router to the new router. But now since i know they are not compatible with my trackers, I want to get a new router that has similar function and requirements. I cannot pull an ethernet cable from the main router however I can run a wired connection between my pc and this new router. Please suggest some router that does this and also i would prefer it to be cheap since i only recently got my current router. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/charlieblood_8"> /u/charlieblood_8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j42tmk/help_me_choose_a_compatible_router/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre
