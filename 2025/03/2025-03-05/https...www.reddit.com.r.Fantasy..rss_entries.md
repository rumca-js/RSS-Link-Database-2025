As someone who has a greater than average interest in folklore, I&#39;ve often said that Jenny Greenteeth is my favourite folktale monster.</p> <p>I couldn&#39;t resist when I saw this book existed.</p> <p>For its opening half, Greenteeth delivers the cosy, folklorey, English-y feeling that I didn&#39;t know I craved. By the time the story reaches its more adventurous conclusion (and I&#39;d suggest that most cosy elements go out of the window in the final third), I was so invested in the characters and the British landscape that I couldn&#39;t stop listening.

I have already read about people with this condition called aphantasia, where they can&#39;t imagine any image or scene in their minds and thus have a hard time enjoying fiction books.</p> <p>I certainly don&#39;t have this because I can make images and daydream about stuff in my mind. I can make images, fight scenes, and all this stuff in my mind, but the issue is that they are all complete garbage compared to the movie adaptations when there is some.</p> <p>When I read about huge kingdoms, dress descriptions, or fight scenes, I usually need to stop and try to imagine those stuff. I literally stop reading and try to imagine the scene. It doesn&#39;t come naturally to me as I&#39;m reading. Sometimes, when I&#39;m fully immersed in the book, that stuff can happen, but it is never really a good image that makes me proud of what I&#39;m seeing.</p> <p>I re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! ‚ô° I am looking for books that focus on powerful but benevolent female characters, especially if described as ethereal and divine or if they are indeed worshipped as a deity / envoy of the divine for whatever reason. I&#39;m not really into &quot;<em>romantasy</em>&quot; because I&#39;m quite tired of all these femcs being literally the same in most recent releases, so I&#39;d like something a bit different! A vast magical world, lots of magic and adventures and development between the characters... Something that will keep me attached to the pages.</p> <p>Thank you in advance, I&#39;m really excited to check out all the suggestions :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bunfla"> /u/bunfla </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j47w2d/fantasy_books_with_ethereal_divine_benevolent/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This book has by far been the most controversial one out of the series. I liked it, though it has a slower pace compared to FW &amp; IF. Things I liked: 1) The harmony between the characters increased readily, both Dain and even Cat got along with Violet pretty well. All of them worked as a team, and having dedicated Rhi, Imogen chapters were nice. 2) The Slow burn was back. Due to Xadens professorship, both Violet and Xaden weren‚Äôt allowed to openly date, making the scenes interesting. Due to the time apart, their Independent personalities shone nicely. 3) The humour, Ridoc, Mira and Brennan really shone throughout the book for me. Dain getting slapped along with Xaden asking Halden if he‚Äôs still a professor at the quest, were my fav scenes. However, I didn‚Äôt like the book as much as IF. The book revolved around travelling to different isles, which was super repetitive. No actual insight on the books gifted by Violets father. Similarly first half wa

Podcasts can be kinda tricky bc you never know what you‚Äôre in the mood for and finding the right one takes time. Physical books are great but they‚Äôre not always the most portable and usually need dedicated reading time (which I love and still do). But no one really talks about how you can just sink into a book while on the bus, walking to class, cleaning, doing laundry, driving, literally anywhere. I feel like audiobooks don‚Äôt get the credit they deserve. They work so well for me, I don‚Äôt mind switching between narrators, I can pick up where I left off, I LOVE immersive reading. Honestly I‚Äôll happily pay $15 a month for Audibleüò©</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TradeValuable7466"> /u/TradeValuable7466 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j3v0yc/audiobooks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested to know how different people started reading Fantasy books. Maybe you were reading other genres for years before finally trying Fantasy, maybe something piqued your interest, or simply just thought &#39;ill give it a go&#39; and ended up loving it. Or maybe a video game / movie inspired you to start reading Fantasy.<br/> For me, i went around 24 years without ever reading a single book or being interested in it, and started watching Game of Thrones. When i found out it was based on book, i just had to read ASOIAF. As soon as i started reading it, i just couldn&#39;t stop and have read lots of different books, epic sagas and series etc and it&#39;s now my main source of entertainment.<br/> My mother is also a massive reader and after finding out i&#39;ve started reading, recommended me David Eddings, Malazan, Joe Abercrombie etc</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Klutzy_Performance

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I havent been able to talk about the series to people who have read the book so i hope some will see this post. Im only halfway done with the series.</p> <p>Back in Shadow of the Torturer when Severian fell into the water on accident, did he revive Dorcas? It seems to me like she was a corpse preserved in the liquid until the claw revived her. Furthermore the man whom was looking for his wife called her &quot;Cas&quot;? Is Dorcas Cas?</p> <p>In the duel it seems obvious that the avern leaf killed Severian and that the claw revived him.</p> <p>Also it was very hard for me to piece it together but as I understand it Joseph the android exploded in the antechamber of the house absolute while Severian was standing right next to him? He describes his face almost being torn off along with fire, electricity, and finding Joseph writhing 20 feet away.</p> <p>Most important to me is understanding how tbe picture cleaner travels from the Citadel to the House Abs

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rant start.</p> <p>Why they feel the need to short print hardcovers for their series (at least the ones I&#39;m interested in) is beyond me. First it was Sun Eater. Impossible to find for under $150. I can understand this one. Debut author peddling an epic sci-fi series. Being conservative with the printing here is probably smart. Tad Williams books on the other hand is not understandable. This man is one of the most well-known fantasy authors of all-time and it is next to Impossible to find The Last King of Osten Ard for a reasonable price and in better than good condition. Specifically books 2 and 3. These books aren&#39;t even that old ! There&#39;s obviously demand for them because you can barely find them online, so I just don&#39;t get why they seem to refuse to reprint them.</p> <p>Rant over.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Its_I_Casper"> /u/Its_I_Casper </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, my fellow scullions, servitors, and would-be heroes. It is done. After 530,000 words, I have finally reached the conclusion of Tad Williams‚Äô first trilogy set in the world of Osten Ard, <em>Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn.</em> I‚Äôve been sitting on this since last night, still reeling from the revelations in the final stretch.</p> <p>Normally, I like to preface my thoughts with a discussion of whether a book lived up to its reputation or the expectations placed upon it. There‚Äôs no need for that here. This book is amazing. It is long‚Äîvery long. So long, in fact, that I opted to buy the two-volume split of <em>To Green Angel Tower,</em> each over 500 pages, just to make the reading experience more manageable. But, my god, was it worth it.</p> <p>Without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in. I‚Äôll include a TLDR at the end for those who want a quick summary, but for now, let‚Äôs begin!</p> <blockquote> <p>The evil minions of the undead Sithi Storm King are beginnin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just started picking up reading again last week and I decided to delve into Romantasy, which previously I would say I was mostly a fan of YA Fiction/Fantasy. One book I saw a lot about was Swordheart, and I bought it along with a few others and just started it yesterday.</p> <p>Well, I finished it in about 8 hours and I am obsessed. I love the writing style and the characters, and I am so hungry for more of that series. I saw in the Epilogue that T. Kingfisher was working on the second book.</p> <p>...Did that every come out? I&#39;ve found posts from years ago talking about it not being published yet and I can&#39;t find anything else related to this series. I&#39;m so sad, I was ready to buy the next one and dive in.</p> <p>Assuming there isn&#39;t any new updates about it, and/or it&#39;s a long ways off, does anyone have suggestions for books that are similar to Swordheart? What other series from T. Kingfisher should I read? Are there any ot
