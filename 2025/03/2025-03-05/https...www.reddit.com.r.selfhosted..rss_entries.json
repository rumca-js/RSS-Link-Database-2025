Last week version v1.0.0 was finally released. Leading up to this I did a major UI revamp which now supports different layouts. </p> <p>Let me know what you think of the new UI.

For example if I own <a href=\"http://boogerdomain.com\">boogerdomain.com</a> proxmox says hey whats your fqdn, i think it defaults to pve.local, opnsense has a local domain I use <a href=\"http://home.arpa\">home.arpa</a>, but since I own my own fqdn how would i utilize it here? Would it be like <a href=\"http://pve.server.boogerdomain.com\">pve.server.boogerdomain.com</a> or something like that? I dont quite follow this but I would love to not use .local .arpa etc, I already use dns rewrites to hit things internally by their fqdn wan counterparts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Squanchy2112\"> /u/Squanchy2112 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1j3qlcr/owned_domains_used_locally/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1j3qlcr/owned_domains_used_locally/\">[co",
