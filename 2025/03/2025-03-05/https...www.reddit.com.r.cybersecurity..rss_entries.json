Over the last few months I\u2019ve been working on a small project for our internal team to perform automated health checks which uses APIs and automation to check all the endpoints that we use and confirm they\u2019re alive. I\u2019ve now reached a point where we can start to do automated health checks for all our cyber teams (for reference I work at an MSSP).</p> <p>What kind of health checks do your companies/you perform ? What comes to mind for other ideas ? </p> <p>The goal of these health checks is not to remediate but to alert and let the teams know of the status. We have SIEM logs that alert on some logs but this doesnt cover everything. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/finnster145\"> /u/finnster145 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j3v5lu/automated_health_checks_ideas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comment",

For example, when considering employees as an asset, there may be several threats and vulnerabilities, but the overall risk might be the same, and ultimately the risk treatment actions could be identical.</p> <p>*Once a gap analysis is completed, do the identified gaps automatically become risks?
