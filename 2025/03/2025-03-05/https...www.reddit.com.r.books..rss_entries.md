<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Y&#39;all I just finished this book in a feverish sprint and I neeeeeed to talk about it. Might be the best book I&#39;ve read in the last 12 months and it absolutely destroyed me.</p> <p>The synopsis: &quot;&quot;The Street&quot; tells the poignant, often heartbreaking story of Lutie Johnson, a young black woman, and her spirited struggle to raise her son amid the violence, poverty, and racial dissonance of Harlem in the late 1940s. Originally published in 1946 and hailed by critics as a masterwork, The Street was Ann Petry&#39;s first novel, a beloved bestseller with more than a million copies in print. Its haunting tale still resonates today.&quot;</p> <p>The use of space is GENIUS in this novel. Spaces become characters in their own right: a street, an apartment, a window on the second story from which a woman hangs out. Everything takes on bigger proportions, making the actions of the characters, the life trajectory of every person, seem inevita

I assumed at first that Open Library was just a nicer user experience and had all the same books as The Internet Archive but after clicking around a bit that doesn’t seem to be the case. For example, it’s not hard at all to find <a href="https://archive.org/details/essaysofgeorgeel0000elio/page/n9/mode/2up">a copy of George Eliot’s essays</a> on the Internet Archive, but <a href="https://openlibrary.org/search?q=Essays+of+George+Eliot&amp;mode=everything">on Open Library</a> I don’t seem to be able to find the same (or any) copy available.

Having fully embraced Carroll&#39;s Alice in Wonderland books, O&#39;Brien&#39;s At Swim Two-Birds, Joyce&#39;s Ulysses, Nabokov&#39;s Pale Fire, and Danielewski&#39;s House of Leaves, I&#39;m very open to authors who present their work in different formats or make great use of word play or blend widely different genres. I realize many might find these things ostentatious, but I think they add a whole new layer of wonder to what otherwise could be just a simple, straightforward story. So, when I was given Pynchon&#39;s Gravity&#39;s Rainbow, I thought for sure I&#39;d love it. But I didn&#39;t. In fact, I ended up hating it. To me, despite it skillfully blending genres, its wonderful word choices, its interesting variations in tone, and its fascinating subject matter, I found its complexity much too complex, its self-references bewildering, its conclusion unresolved and it meandered much more than I would li

The whole book feels like it could be summed up with that Thomas Hobbes quote: <em>&quot;No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;</em> Every character just seems to get beaten down again and again, and it&#39;s honestly depressing.</p> <p>I did a bit of Googling to see if things lighten up, but most of what I found were people who read

He rose like cream to the top of milk. He clicked his heels as perfectly as a dancer does. He knew every kind of military courtesy and insisted on using it all. Generals were afraid of him because he knew more about the deportment of a soldier than they did. Captain Loft thought and believed that a soldier is the highest development of animal life. If he considered God at all, he thought of Him as an old and honoured general, retired and grey, living among remembered battles and putting wreaths on the graves of his lieutenants several times a year.
