AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and 9070 GPUs are launching tomorrow. This benchmark and review of the AMD RX 9070 XT (Sapphire Pulse model) looks at the gaming performance, ray tracing, power consumption, and efficiency vs. the NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti, 5070, AMD's prior 7900 XT, and plenty more GPUs. The benchmarks for the RX 9070 non-XT will go live a little later on our channel. The 9070 XT has an MSRP of $600, with the 9070 at $550 MSRP. "Actual" pricing is TBD, as the NVIDIA launch has certainly set a current meta of pricing and availability issues. We'll follow-up on the price situation once the cards are publicly released. These benchmarks look at the best GPUs available in early 2025, including prior generation cards that you might be able to buy used. We're expecting another round of lower-end cards (likely the 5060, 5060 Ti, and possible 9060) in a few months. We're also waiting to see if Intel ships a B770 or equiv

This is a tear-down and disassembly of the RTX 5070 Founders Edition. NVIDIA's RTX 5070 is a GPU you shouldn't buy right now. Aside from the marketing lies, the positioning of it makes it hardly any different from a 4070 Super. AMD's RX 9070 XT and 9070 launch reviews later today (when this video posts), so we'll talk more about value there. For all the many faults of the 50 series, the thermal design and mechanical design of the FE cards have both improved dramatically since prior launches. Credit where it's due there. Now if only they'd stop lying on stage about the gaming performance.
