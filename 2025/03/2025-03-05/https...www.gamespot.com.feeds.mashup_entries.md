<p>You're probably wondering why Focus Mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a> is a bit finicky. As you take on numerous gargantuan beasts, this mechanic is one that enables you to track targets and land devastating blows. However, making use of it is a bit cumbersome... at least until you make a small tweak to the controls. Our guide tells you just what you need to do to alleviate combat-induced migraines in your playthrough.</p><h2>How to make combat easier with the Focus Mode toggle in Monster Hunter Wilds </h2><p>Focus Mode is a game mechanic that's supposed to make combat easier. First, it requires you to hold the button prompt--i.e. L2/LT on a gamepad, Left Alt on a keyboard, or the Mouse 4 button on a mouse. This lets you aim and track a target as it moves around the area.</p><p>More importantly, it makes wounds easier to discern. When you repeatedly hit a monster's body parts, these wounds appear as brig

<p dir="ltr">Before Final Fantasy VII took RPGs as a whole into the mainstream, Suikoden made its mark as one of the first quality role-playing titles released outside of Japan on PlayStation. The game's main conceit was based loosely on the Chinese literary classic The Water Margin: A young outcast and his friends gather up companions to form the 108 Stars of Destiny, building a magnificent rebel outpost and eventually toppling a wicked empire. Suikoden's success would inspire multiple sequels, including immediate follow-up Suikoden II, regarded by many as a shining gem in the PS1's RPG library.</p><p dir="ltr">With fame and acclaim, however, comes a price tag: Original copies of Suikoden II run in the hundreds of dollars, and that's even with several well-known, game-breaking bugs that were inadvertently introduced in the English version. Here's where Konami seemingly swoops in to the rescue, offering both Suikoden I and II together for a low price and promising beautiful new HD gr

<p dir="ltr">Usually, the thought of police going undercover brings to mind Hollywood-esque stakeouts where authorities utilize binoculars in cars. But in Brazil, the cops went undercover for Sao Paulo Carnival celebrations by dressing up as Mario and Luigi to arrest alleged thieves.</p><p dir="ltr">Sao Paulo Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas shared a video <a href="https://x.com/tarcisiogdf/status/1896911554961924399">on X</a> of three officers--two outfitted as the Super Mario Bros., with the other supposedly being Yoshi--placing a suspect in the back of a police vehicle. The short clip also has Super Mario World music playing as a soundtrack.

<p>The next film from Avengers: Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo, The Electric State, is set to release on Netflix on March 14, and it'll be accompanied by a prequel video game. With the duo also set to direct Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, they were recently asked if they'd be interested in developing games for those films, something that the pair say they're potentially interested in, but they are currently prioritizing their other commitments. What makes this proposition interesting is that Fortnite creator Donald Mustard recently joined their media company AGBO--a partnership that the Russos say will allow them to tell new stories across transmedia projects.</p><p>"We would definitely be open to it," Joe Russo said to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-electric-state-video-game-prequel-netflix-russos-1236325355/">Variety</a>.

<p>Developer Bad Guitar Studio has announced that it has delayed the PS5 and Xbox releases of Fragpunk due to technical difficulties, though the PC version will still launch tomorrow, March 6. A new release date for the console versions has not been revealed.</p><p>"During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaption," the team said in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438">statement</a>. "Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p><p>As consolation, players will receive all rewards gained through engagement from the start of Season 1 until the console versions go live. These include in-game currency, cosmetics, and experience.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fragpunk-gets-la

<p dir="ltr">This isn't a mistake or a typo. Sony has released a new update for the PS3--not the PS4 or PS5--that "improves system performance." While that description is especially vague, it's possible the patch relates to renewing the Blu-ray player encryption key for the home console.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1897200775819862327?s=46">On X</a>, the Ask PlayStation account announced the new PS3 update and pointed players to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">the PlayStation website</a>. Sony says 200MB must be available on the system's hard drive to download version 4.92. The company also then writes in bold about the Blu-ray player encryption key renewal to continue playing discs. The last console patch occurred just over a year ago on February 27, 2024, for version 4.91.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1897200775819862327?s=46" data-has-image="true"><bl
