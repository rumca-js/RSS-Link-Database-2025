Think this movie handles momentum and impending doom as well as any horror film and the slow burn approach really works in its favour. </p> <p>I love horror films but I find very few of them to be truly unsettling. Sequences in Prince of Darkness just freak me out, though. Those recurring dream messages from the future with the distorted voice and low-budget VHS footage get under my skin, and the \u201cYOU WILL NOT BE SAVED!\u201d scene is just a masterclass of tension. </p> <p>I also think it has an all-timer ending. The dream sequence repeats once more and the ambiguity of it all (you\u2019re not sure if the evil is still out there or not) is so well done. Prime example of show, don\u2019t tell.</p> <p>While The Thing is the superior film, Prince of Darkness is scarier IMO. What do you all think of the movie? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This was basically the pilot episode for Airwolf the series from the 80s. I think eventually it was cut up into individual episodes for TV but I remember it as being an actual film you could rent out from the video shop during the 80s. If it actually made it to the cinema I&#39;m not sure. But it was pretty good for a TV film and was also rated an 18 which was slightly bizarre. Much more adult themed than the TV series too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TechnicalTrash95\"> /u/TechnicalTrash95 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3zadk/does_anyone_remember_airwolfthe_movie/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3zadk/does_anyone_remember_airwolfthe_movie/\">[comments]</a></span>",
