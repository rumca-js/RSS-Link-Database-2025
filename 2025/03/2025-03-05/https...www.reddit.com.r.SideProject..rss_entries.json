I\u2019ve hit 500 signups, but retention\u2019s low\u2014users just aren\u2019t sticking around. My motivation has taken a hit after putting in so much time and effort in the app and not seeing better results. </p> <p>So, I&#39;m weighing my options, should I:</p> <ul> <li>Push forward: Add daily challenges, rewards, and expand the game</li> <li>Pivot: Switch to education, license the content or something else.</li> </ul> <p>What I\u2019d love to hear:</p> <ol> <li>How do you boost retention in apps like this?</li> <li>What keeps you coming back to trivia games?</li> <li>Pivot now or double down?</li> </ol> <p>If you\u2019ve been grinding on a project for a while too, I\u2019d really value your perspective.

I wanted to share it here and get some feedback! I noticed that many investors struggle to analyze deals efficiently. Most rely on scattered tools, manual calculations, or complex spreadsheets. HAVN aims to make rental investing easier by putting all the key insights in one place. It includes pertinent data like investment returns, comparable properties, and other property &amp; market insights. The goal is to minimize the amount of time between seeing a potential investment and making an investment, as time is a killer of all deals. I\u2019m currently building out the UI/UX. Before going live, I\u2019d love to collect early feedback and connect with other side project builders. I Would love to hear your thoughts, critiques, &amp; suggestions on how to market this tool!</p> <p>If",

It&#39;s a free tool that lets you add cool, animated subtitles to your short videos, all right in your browser. No need to upload files or worry about privacy\u2014everything happens locally. No signup, no watermarks.</p> <p>The Backstory:</p> <p>There are a lot of statistics saying that huge numbers of people watch video without sound, or that subtitles dramatically increase the likelihood that viewers will watch to the end. I believed it because I read one such statistic in the thousandth video I \u201cread\u201d word by word on youtube shorts. I realized that videos with dynamic subtitles really grab attention.</p> <p>There are quite a few tools on the market that do this, but when it comes to web applications, I haven&#39;t found anything that is free (without watermarks), works reasonably good for non-English-language videos, and doesn&#39;t scream \u201cbuy me\u201d",

This method allowed me to visualize patterns and progress, but it also made me realize the limitations of manual tracking. This is how the idea of \u200b\u200bHabitGrid came about: a digital tool that not only makes it easy to record habits, but also offers statistics and analysis to drive continuous improvement.\u200b</p> <p>I&#39;m excited to share HabitGrid with you and look forward to your feedback and suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project!\u200b</p> <p>You can try HabitGrid here: <a href=\"https://habitgrid.io/\">https://habitgrid.io/</a></p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Ariel</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",

Initially, we spoke to some potential customers who were very excited to use the product and even pay for it. Our reason for building this was personal since I and my cofounder both faced this problem ourselves.</p> <p>Since I am a student, due to my college hectic schedule it took me some time to finally complete the MVP but even then we had no money to ship it. So we waited for about a month trying to figure out some money to handle our early adopters and start the feedback loop. But we couldn&#39;t. Now those same customers we were earlier very excited about are not even responding. I understand they might be busy or got a better solution. So, we thought to get some more users and this time we will directly onboard them. But to even support early adopters we need to take an upfront payment and then give them the access.</p> <p>My Question is-</",
