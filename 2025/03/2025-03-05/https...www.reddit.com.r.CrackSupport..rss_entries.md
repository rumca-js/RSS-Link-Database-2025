<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is fitgirl repack truly safe?</p> <p>Yesterday, I installed DARK SOULS 3 on the legit website (the first one that pops up) I downloaded it from qbitorrent and everything was fine.</p> <p>Today I was playing elden ring chill while switching tabs and messaging a friend and suddenly my game was glitched with pixels. So I ALT F4 and relaunch it. But my pc got a weird blue screen of death not so blue screen with pixel errors and bugs and idk about y&#39;all but I was thinking it was either a GPU bug that I was able to fix just by restarting my pc or maybe the fitgirl repack?</p> <p>I mean I really made sure it was the legit legit guys I did research and everything but I just wanna know if I did anything wrong. Would love to have help (not hating on fitgirl repack at all whatso ever)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Existing-Culture9859"> /u/Existing-Culture9859 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red
