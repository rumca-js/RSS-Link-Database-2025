Warning: Full spoilers follow for Daredevil: Born Again Episodes 1 and 2.

Well, they did it. Many observant fans have been predicting this, and now it’s happened.
Again, don't read any further if you're worried about Daredevil: Born Again Episode 1 spoilers.
OK, still here?
They killed Foggy Nelson.
Specifically, Wilson Bethel’s “Dex” Poindexter (that’s Bullseye to comics readers) resurfaces in the opening minutes of Born Again and assassinates Foggy (Elden Henson), the best friend and longtime partner of Matt Murdock/Daredevil (Charlie Cox). Foggy dies in Karen Page’s (Deborah Ann Woll) arms, so that just when you thought the new Disney+ Daredevil show was picking up right where the Netflix Marvel series left off, all of that goes straight out the (stained glass) window.
IGN's Scott Collura asked Cox and his Kingpin costar Vincent D’Onofrio how they felt when they found out Foggy was doomed. The pair apparently had been heavily briefed by the Marvel military-industrial complex to k

Daredevil: Born Again series premiere reviewed by Joshua Yehl. Streaming on Disney+.

Daredevil: Born Again does a bang up job with ol’ Hornhead’s long-awaited return. The show captures the signature drama and brutality of Netflix’s Daredevil series while taking the story of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk in a bold (and surprisingly topical) new direction. It’s to Marvel’s credit that they’ve set up such a gripping face-off not between Daredevil and Kingpin but between their civilian-facing personas. But for all the new show does right, there are still a few quibbles to be had – mainly, the lack of supporting characters who pop in these first two episodes and the fact that we are yet again getting a story about Murdock giving up being Daredevil.
