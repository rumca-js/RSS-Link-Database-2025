<p>Apple used to treat every public-facing announcement like an event. Even its keynotes — ostensibly for investors and press — were well-orchestrated circuses. If there's any conclusion to be drawn from the sheer number of new products the company's launched without any kind of event since the <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-iphone-16-launches-september-20-and-starts-at-799-144939985.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-iphone-16-launches-september-20-and-starts-at-799-144939985.html">iPhone 16 series </a>was introduced six months ago, the time for hanging on Apple's every word has passed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of it can be chalked up to the company's new preference for recorded, highly-edited video presentations rather than live shows. Some of it might also have to do with the fact that <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-a

<p>The POV footage shows the lander descending toward the Moon and the subsequent landing. It ends with a striking view of Blue Ghost emerging from a cloud of dust as its shadow stretches across the lunar surface. It’s pretty darn cool, with surprisingly-crisp HD visuals.</p>

<p>Elon Musk discovered a simple 30-second “fridge trick” that can reverse diabetes, but the discovery has spooked pharmaceutical companies so much they put a $78 million bounty on his head, forcing the Tesla CEO to flee the country. At least, that’s what a collection of AI-generated Facebook ads claim.</p>

<p>AMD has finally done it. For years it's tried to undercut NVIDIA with slightly cheaper, but less capable, video cards like the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html#:~:text=At%20the%20very%20least%2C%20the,purchase%20until%20prices%20stabilize%20significantly.">Radeon 6700 XT </a>and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-7900-xtx-xt-review-better-4k-gaming-140002305.html">7900 XT</a>. And sure, it's still following that same strategy with the new Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT. This time around, though, AMD has produced far more capable hardware, especially when it comes to 4K and ray tracing performance. And there's hope that it could finally catch up to NVIDIA's DLSS AI upscaling with its new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR4) technology.</p> 
<p>These aren't perfect video cards, to be clear. But for $549 and $599, the Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT are far more compelling than AMD'

While the vehicle can technically be considered a sedan, Volvo says it has the "adaptability of a fastback, and the spacious interior and higher ground clearance associated with SUVs." It's the first Volvo EV with an 800-volt system, which promises faster charging times. Since Volvo's 800-volt technology uses lighter components to reduce the vehicle's overall weight, it could also lead to a longer range and better acceleration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the ES90, specifically, Volvo promises a driving range of 700 kilometers or 435 miles, though the official EPA range could be shorter. When plugged into a 350 kW fast charger, the model can add 300 kilometers (186 miles) of range in just 10 minutes, and its 106 kWh battery can go from 10 to 80 percent full in just 20

But to really get the most out of a MacBook, we recommend adding a few accessories — both for your stay-put command center and your on-the-go setup. External keyboards and mice can improve your ergonomics, a webcam can enhance your video calls and a docking station lets you connect more than the built-in ports will allow.

<p>To experience the true grandeur of the cinema in your house, nothing can top a projector. A good one can show a bright, sharp image up to 150 inches in size for an immersive experience that no TV can match — and often at a much lower price. Plus, they’re great for gaming and can even be used as a second screen for your computer.<br><br>Projectors have gained popularity of late so there are tons of options to choose from. Classic models that mount on the ceiling are brighter and sharper than ever, and you can choose either bulbs or lasers as a light source depending on your budget. If you’d rather mount one on the floor close to the screen, you can choose from dozens of ultra short throw (UST) models as well.<br><br>But compared to TVs, projectors remain a bit more confusing for a majority of buyers. This guide will fill you in on important details to consider like brightness, type (classic, portable and ultra short throw) and other factors to help you choose the best model for you
