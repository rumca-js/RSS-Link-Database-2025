        "description": "Suikoden 1 And 2 are two very good (even great, in the case of the sequel) games that are classics of their genre, and have been remastered and brought to modern audiences with very little of the originals\u2019 fine gameplay altered or updated. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t ever played Suikoden, this collection is the best way to experience those classic adventures for the first time. And if you are already a fan of the series, you will be pleased at how well these games hold up all these years later \u2013 and just how deft a hand Konami had when bringing them over to modern audiences.",

        "description": "Monster Hunter Wilds has taken the world by storm, and if you don't believe us, its sales tell the whole story - over eight million units in three days. It doesn't just clear Monster Hunter World's record in the same period, but is now the fastest-selling game in recent years. But why, especially given PC performance issues, multiplayer complaints, and whatnot?\n\nThere are many potential reasons. The combat is the series' best yet, and the roster of monsters provides excellent variety. Even if the endgame doesn't offer many challenges, there's still a significant amount of stuff to do (and some Tempered threats pack a real punch). Presentation-wise, the attention to detail is immaculate, whether it's the idle animations or the endemic life in locales.\n\nHowever, perhaps most important is how it caters to veterans and newcomers in numerous ways, including the sheer fun of hunting. It's only just getting started but Monster Hunter Wilds could very well become this generation's most succe",
