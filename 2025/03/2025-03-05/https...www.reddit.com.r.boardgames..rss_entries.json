I decided to get a couple of larger games and using a tracked international shipping service is costing me more than the price of the games themselves.</p> <p>It costs me about $16 per 1KG so currently my $100 copy of Tainted Grail is costing me $125 in shipping alone! Is this normal? I&#39;m feeling crushed by these prices knowing that I&#39;ll be paying +$100 per each game I import.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey board gamers of Reddit ! I am attempting to make my own board game from scratch with the theme of abandoned island survival/escape My ideas so far are character cards with attribute ratings which include \u2022physical strength \u2022hunting skills \u2022moral integrity \u2022crafting skills \u2022ingenuity \u2022leadership skills The other side of the character card would be variable stats like health, hunger, thirst, etc. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking to have 4 different areas of terrain on the island- water, desert, mountain, and jungle. I have ideas so far on resources and dangers found in each terrain but I\u2019m struggling to find the ways to make for strategic game play rather than just chance by cards drawn and dice rolled. Character cards and inventory will be dealt between players at the start of the game. That\u2019s about all I have so far. I have no game creating experience. Any advice would be appreciated!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
