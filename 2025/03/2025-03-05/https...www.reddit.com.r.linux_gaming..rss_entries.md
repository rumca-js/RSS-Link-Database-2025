I know there are hundreds of posts about xbox controller issues, I&#39;ve tried a lot of different things to get this to work but can&#39;t even get linux to see the controller for pairing.</p> <p>I&#39;ve got a newer controller for series x/s, model 1914 desktop is running latest version if Zorin, I have a AXE5400 bluetooth 5.3 pci adapter. I&#39;ve tried to follow steps on posts/github for xpadneo, for xow and a few other things but no matter what, my controller just isn&#39;t able to even be seen in connection settings. I&#39;m dual booting windows 11 from a different drive and I can connect to it flawlessly on windows. I updated the firmware for the controller and still issue persists. I see a bunch of posts saying that newer controllers should just work, so not sure what my issue is.</p> <p>I found the mac address for my BT adapter and for the controller on windows, I then moved to linux and viewed

They put me in charge of setting it up, but after three months, I still can&#39;t get it to work properly.</p> <p>The joystick is misaligned, with the center position always tilted down and to the left. Additionally, the axes only register up to about 40%, making it difficult to control the plane.</p> <p>I’m running EndeavorOS, and my joystick device is located at <code>/dev/input/js0</code>. I’ve tested both my USB 3.0 ports, but the issue persists. My current Proton launch command looks like this:<br/> <code>%command% -FastLaunch SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE=/dev/input/js0</code>. I’ve tried running it with and without specifying <code>SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE</code>, but it hasn’t made a difference. Fortunately, the issue persists in all Proton/Wine games, not just MSFS 2020.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried fixing it using <code>jscal</code> and <code>jstest-gtk</code>, but the

Nothing. Then I think &quot;Cachy does a lot of weird shit, maybe it&#39;s them&quot; so I wipe the drive - install Fedora and still bugs.</p> <p>Then someone on Discord says &quot;Why not try it in isolation and see if it&#39;s indeed a GPU problem or a MESA/Vulkan problem since it&#39;s not obviously not AMDGPU related&quot;.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wanted to point this out as we just got benchmarks. Also for those wondering about FSR vs. DLSS, FSR 4 is comparable to DLSS 4 without transformer, but slightly weaker than the transformer model, but I&#39;d argue for most people is good enough, but you may not fully get rid of that TAA blur like you would with transformer + DLAA.</p> <p>In ray tracing or AI it&#39;s worse than Nvidia, but this is to be expected.</p> <p>The price to performance value puts the 9070 XT at a very competitive spot in the mid range, and outside of the US or MSRP comparisons, we&#39;d see an even larger gap between AMD and Nvidia prices, making the 9070 XT probably the best offering AMD has put out in years with the improvements to ray tracing and FSR + price point.</p> <p>At 4K I don&#39;t recommend getting this card if you plan on using ray tracing, but if you don&#39;t plan on using ray tracing and are fine lowering some settings or using FSR 4 Quality to Balance i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Exactly as the title is. There are certain games I will play that will freeze my entire laptop and I will have to force shutdown, some of these being Risk of Rain 2 and Team Fortress 2. They either freeze on startup, a few seconds into booting, or when I try to start playing a match/run. This happens almost every single time I play these games, and only started happening about a few weeks ago. This happens regardless of what I have open (typically only steam and the game itself).</p> <p>Other games however run perfectly fine like Fallout 3 and Fallout NV, and have never frozen my pc. Applications like Firefox, Discord and Spotify have also never had this issue. I&#39;m wondering if this is a Linux issue or issue with my computer. I assume it is the latter, but is there any way to get around this than just getting a better computer?</p> <p>Specs are as follows: Linux mint Cinnamon 21.2 16gb ram Nvidia rtx 2060 gpu Intel i7-1185G7 cpu 512gb SSD</p> </d

We shipped a few updates over the years but she didn&#39;t want to work on the game anymore and gave it to me a few years ago. On the other hand I didn&#39;t want to build on the existing Unity version (for various reasons) but I still wanted to expand and improve the game.</p> <p>Over the course of the years, I learned Godot and decided to completely redo the game: my fiancee redrew all the graphics and added more, the code is completely rewritten by myself and the story of the game is expanded.</p> <p>The new game Flufftopia: Fluffmazing Edition will release somewhen in June!</p> <p>It is made on my old ThinkCentre with MX Linux installed and should work on anything build in the last ten years (likely even older).</p> <p><strong>Key Features</strong><

How do I achieve this in Linux (currently running Nobara).</p> <p>I also have the weird issue where I get sick from FPS above 100. As I only play single player games I am not an FPS fiend and 90 is fine for me. On Windows I use Adrenaline Chill to enforce it on all games. How do I do that in Linux? And how can I limit my FPS also on desktop? Card churns out max frames when I really don&#39;t need that on Desktop. I would rather have it &quot;chill&quot; a bit to draw less power.</p> <p>So far experience on Linux has been great but these are my 2 current issues. I have been told MangoHud helps with the FPS limiting but I can&#39;t find how to use it with non steam games or the desktop.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chaosmeister"> /u/Chaosmeister </a> <br/> <span><a href="
