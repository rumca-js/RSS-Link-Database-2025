It&#39;d be nice to be able to show our children it when they&#39;re a bit older to see what they remember of the old house, and to be honest I&#39;d like to keep it for myself too.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just bought a gaming laptop lately, upgraded it with an extra SSD, and transferred all my old files and data to the new machine. Then, during an overseas trip, for some reason I got totally no clue, I put it in my checked luggage. You can probably guess what happened next—rough baggage handling completely destroyed it.</p> <p>After a long argument with the airline, they did reimburse me for the laptop, but a lot of my data was lost. Sure, all the important files were backed up, but I had so many photos and videos that weren’t exactly &quot;&quot;important&quot;&quot; but still really precious to me. Since I never had the habit of backing those up, I ended up losing more than half of them. Super frustrating.</p> <p>Have you guys ever had a similar experience? How did you deal with it afterward?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Then_Brush_2125"> /u/Then_Brush_2125 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/

I am trying to burn music onto CDs, I bought a pack of 50, but I&#39;m trying to maximize how much I get onto them. Is it a bad idea to fill the disc up to almost its limit with data? For example, I&#39;ve used 42 minutes out of 80 on my first disc, and I&#39;m debating as to whether or not I should add another 22 minutes on to maximize how much I have on one disc.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everybody, I recently purchased a base Mac Mini M4 with the intention of using it as a Plex server. The thing is that I don&#39;t really know which is the best way to store all my media.</p> <p>I was thinking about using a QNAP TR-004, but I don&#39;t really care about backups, RAID configurations or any of that. I&#39;d like to start with 8 TB (2x4 TB disks) and later upgrade it to 16 TB (4x4TB disks) and, if it&#39;s possible, without having to format the previous drives. I really just need something that can plug 4 drives to a single USB-3 (or Thunderbolt 4) port, and for those 4 drives to show up (and keep the speed reasonable, 1Gb/s is reasonable). If there&#39;s a cheaper way of doing that I&#39;d love to hear it.</p> <p>What would you guys suggest for my use case? Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tuxi04"> /u/tuxi04 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/
