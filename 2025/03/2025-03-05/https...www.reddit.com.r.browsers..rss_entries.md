<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been obsessed with browsers for a long time, and I recently shared my interest with my sister. But in her opinion, most browsers are the same. This provided me with a fresh perspective on the matter. </p> <p>For her, for example, Brave, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, they all actually look the same. Maybe there are subtle gaps in usage, such as Brave being more privacy and security oriented. But for her, they&#39;re just bookmarking URLs and browsing the web, and the difference doesn&#39;t seem to be that big. </p> <p>It&#39;s the interface and functionality that really make the difference for her. For example, Arc is so different from Chrome that she thinks it&#39;s a new browser. So in her opinion, there are only three real browsers: Chrome-like, Safari-like, and Arc-like. </p> <p>I&#39;m not saying I totally agree with her. It&#39;s just really interesting to see the whole interest thing from an outside perspective. It reminds me of her makeup. I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been a chrome user on windows for the past 10 years and I finally decided to switch to another browser cause uBlock Origin isn&#39;t being supported on it anymore.</p> <p>My main priorities are it being low on memory usage, safe, easy to use and either having an extension for ublock origin or having an inbuilt adblocker. (not necessary but I&#39;d also prefer having an inbuilt vpn or an extension for one).</p> <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about opera gx, firefox (heard they are gonna turn to selling our data, so would you still recommend it) and brave. What are the pros and cons of each and which one would you recommend?</p> <p>I&#39;m open to other options as well, but those are the ones I&#39;ve heard the most about.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Crimson_8170"> /u/Crimson_8170 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1j41yg

And that&#39;s after I closed all the preset tabs. Also I read some similar reviews about Zen unfortunately.</p> <p>Any recommendations please?
