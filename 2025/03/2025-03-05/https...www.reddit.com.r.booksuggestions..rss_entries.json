I\u2019m looking for a novel about what it was like living in Germany during the very very bad and evil times because I find the parallels to what\u2019s happening in the U.S. to be equal parts interesting/illuminating and horrifying. </p> <p>I really enjoyed \u201cThe Mitford Affair\u201d by Marie Benedict and loved \u201cLilac Girls\u201d by Martha Hall Kelly. </p> <p>I\u2019m super fortunate to have the NYPL and it\u2019s massive collection of e-books at my disposal, but having hard time figuring out what to search for to find what I\u2019m looking for- thanks in advance for any and all recommendations!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

Since I can&#39;t physically leave right now, I&#39;d love a book that can take me to another world or time.</p> <p>Can y&#39;all suggest an uplifting, engrossing book that bears no resemblance to our political climate right now? Mystery, fantasy, intelligent comedy...

Anyways, one thing that specifically fascinated me, was &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&quot; a book within a book. Reading these chapters was mind-blowing, in a way I learnt nothing, in another I learnt everything, as Orwell wrote &quot;The best books are the one&#39;s that tell you what you already know&quot; (or something like that). </p> <p>So my questions are: Is there a full version of this book? (perhaps a stupid question but doesn&#39;t hurt to try) Or are the excerpts in &quot;1984&quot; the only parts available?</p> <p>How can I better understand the book, It explores politics and Philosophy, economics, war, psychology... Many topics one could devote an entire life to studying. But is there a deep dive of someone more",

However the problem is I have no clue where to start. Personally as a girl who has never read in her life. I always thought books were boring and just had words filled into one page.. I don\u2019t want something that is overly complicated I want a book that grabs my attention and keeps me engaged to it. Like something that consists of suspense or a thriller, romance or comedy. Don\u2019t really care about the genre, however I want a book filled with plot twists, a book that contains a deeper meaning. A book that makes a person remember it.</p> <p>If anyone has recommendations, Im willing to acknowledge them. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude14</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/XenithXd0\"> /u/XenithXd0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j3v5ob/boring_books/\">[link]</a></span> &",
