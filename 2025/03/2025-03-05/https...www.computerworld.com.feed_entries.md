Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-wants-kill-527-billion-semiconductor-chips-subsidy-law-2025-03-05/"> called the CHIPS Act “horrible,”</a> and said whatever money hasn’t been spent should now be used to reduce  the national debt.</p>

<p>“Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” Trump told Congress during his address. “We give hundreds of billions of dollars, and it doesn’t mean a thing. They take our money and they don’t spend it. All tha

<p>“It encompasses every step in the silicon manufacturing process — fabrication, die preparation, assembly, testing, manufacturing and warehousing,” said Jennifer Larson, general manager of commercial client segments at Intel’s Client Computing Group.</p>

<p>Whether you believe AI will be the salvation of humankind or the death of it, whether you think it’s little more than a plaything to while away your time or the surest way to get onto the fast track at work, you’re going to use it someday. Maybe today. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next week or next month. But one day, you’ll turn to it. And you’ll most likely be surprised at how helpful it can be.</p>
