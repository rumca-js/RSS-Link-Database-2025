<p>With the recent Firefox 136 update, Mozilla’s web browser got several improvements and new features, including vertical tabs that sit in a new sidebar and provide a better overview when you have tons of open tabs. The update brings improved security via fixed vulnerabilities, which apply to Firefox ESR and Tor Browser as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-14/">Mozilla’s 2025-14 Security Advisory report</a> shows at least 15 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox 136, with a “high” risk rating given to five entries for individual vulnerabilities reported by external researchers. For example, the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1930">CVE-2025-1930</a> vulnerability can be used to break out of the browser sandbox on Windows.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, OLED monitors are dropping down to attainable prices. Dell and Alienware consistently deliver some of the best prices in the category, and Alienware’s new 27-inch 1440p OLED is the cheapest yet. The new design debuts this summer with a price of just $549.99.</p>



<p>That’s an amazing price for an OLED monitor, especially with its 280Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time. The Alienware AW2725D gives you the usual gaming goodies like G-Sync and FreeSync compatibility, and the “sweet spot” 1440p resolution that’s extremely popular at the moment. Alienware is using a new stand design and some updated aesthetics, too. Other technical details will have to wait for the “Summer 2025” release date in North America. (The exterior design for this monitor isn’t finished yet, apparently, so the header image above is the new AW2725Q 4K 27-incher

<p>What’s the easiest way to get some extra storage space on your laptop? Grab a flash drive! It doesn’t even have to cost you much because there are sweet deals like this one: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MUF-128AB-AM-Plus-128GB/dp/B07D7Q41PM/">Samsung’s 256GB Fit Plus is only $23 on Amazon</a>, a considerable 34 percent discount.</p>

Thankfully, it has a nifty lanyard hole so you can hook it up to a keychain, for example, and not worry about losing it. It’s robust enough to withstand bumps and drops, and protected against water, heat, magnets, and even X-rays.</p>



<p>Its compact size makes it easy to carry anywhere and plug into anything, including laptops, PCs, gaming consoles, and even your car’s media sys

<p>YouTube Premium ain’t cheap at $13.99 per month for ad-free streaming, especially since it seems like YouTube is intentionally making itself worse to get you to pay up. How does $7.99 sound instead?</p>



<p>Starting today, YouTube is offering its Premium Lite paid tier to users in the US after having tested it out in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2494450/youtube-is-testing-a-cheaper-premium-lite-plan-that-still-has-ads.html">a handful of other countries</a>. You pay less for fewer features, but you still get to block ads… mostly.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/">According to the announcement</a>, YouTube Premium Lite offers a mostly ad-free experience for watching videos on desktop and mobile apps, but there are a few provisos and quid-pro-quos.

<p>Apple unveiled new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air models Wednesday, as the company continued its week of <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2625363/tim-cook-teases-another-surprise-apple-release-this-week.html">Air-themed</a> product announcements. The new MacBook Airs aren’t exactly groundbreaking—it’s no surprise Apple didn’t feel it necessary to save these for a blockbuster press event—but their upgrades are quietly worthwhile. They certainly outdo the previous day’s <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2626371/really-the-new-ipad-air-has-a-new-chip-and-thats-it.html">underwhelming</a> iPad Air refresh.</p>



<p>Like that new iPad, the new MacBooks are based around a processor upgrade: both models now run an M4 (up from an M3). That’s the newest and most powerful generation of Apple chips, so you can expect searing fast performance. Just bear

<p>If your wallet’s feeling lighter this week, you probably already know why. With President Trump implementing his 25 percent tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and doubling his existing tariff on Chinese imports to 20 percent, two of the biggest retailers in the US are warning shoppers that prices will rise almost immediately.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/business/target-earnings/index.html">CNN quotes</a> Best Buy CEO Corie Barry, who says that “we’ve never seen this kind of breadth of tariffs.” She expects manufacturers to pass rising costs onto retailers and, effectively, consumers. Target CEO Brian Cornell <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-mexico-tariffs-will-raise-produce-prices-target-ceo-cornell-says.html">said the same to CNBC</a>: “The consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of d

<p>Unless you’ve spent the last twelve hours or so in a tent outside a Best Buy, you probably don’t have a new Nvidia card in your hands right now. In a depressingly familiar sight, the RTX 5070 has immediately sold out at every online retailer, following the same pattern as the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2613344/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-sells-out-instantly-surprising-no-one.html">RTX 5070 Ti</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">5080/5090 launches</a> over the last few weeks. Initial stocks are depleted despite huge markups on most models.</p>



<p>Less than ten minutes after the 9 AM EST launch, Best Buy, Newegg, and B&H all showed every single RTX 5070 card as out of stock or otherwise unavailable. Between high demand from PC gamers (and the scalpers who want to take adv
