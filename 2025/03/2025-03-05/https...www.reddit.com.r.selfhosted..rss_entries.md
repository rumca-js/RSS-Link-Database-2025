It runs on users&#39; personal hardware (Android phones and computers), but I‚Äôm wondering how to address concerns from non-technical users who might be wary of using a solution that accesses their data between devices‚Äîespecially coming from a solo indie developer (me).</p> <p>Since many people won‚Äôt be able to use tools like WireShark to monitor data access, how can I help ease their concerns and build trust in my solution?

One is only VMs running single dockerized apps, and the other is one single VM with only dockerized apps inside. Starting to add tailscale to some - like audiobookshelf and calibre-web, so I can access them when away from home. (I am truly floored at how easy this was and how well it worked).</p> <p>I&#39;m still very new to self-hosting, Linux, and running all these &quot;servers,&quot; but before I go too deep into this, should I just set everything up using Headscale instead? The two proxmox servers run 24/7, so they are ideal for this. Someone posted a very detailed write-up about a year ago in this sub on how to set up Headscale, which seems doable, even for a newbie like me.</p> <p>A second question is on server load. When streaming an audiobook, the proxmox server load barely moves. I thought it would take a bigger hit, but it did not. Is that because it is simply streaming a fil

Basically, it&#39;s a JS library that lets you build multi-step forms and surveys with very little code. The forms themselves are exactly like Typeform&#39;s. Right now, it does not have a backend, but you can obviously just POST the data directly in your database or wherever else.</p> <p>The big advantage (in my head at least) is that it integrates natively into your codebase. The forms themselves live inside your product, so no iframes, no monthly response cap, etc. You have full control of everything.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for some genuine feedback on this? Can I potentially grow this into a company? Do you think what I have is useful already? Some obvious ideas are building out a backend and integrations, etc. I&#39;m also more than happy to help anyone with integration and support if you decide to use the libra

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I will admit before summarizing this issue that networking is my biggest weakness with self-hosting.<br/> Here&#39;s the summary:<br/> I have 2 ProxMox nodes (PCs) connected to an unmanaged switch which runs to my ISPs all-in-one fibre box. The ISP box does the DHCP, DNS, WIFI, everything. All traffic from both nodes runs to the 10gig port on the back of this box.</p> <p>A while back now I started having this issue where some of my LXC&#39;s (which all have their own MAC and IP) would lose internet for roughly 5-10 minutes. They can still ping each other, and some of them still have connection it would only be 1 or 2 failing to resolve at a time while everything else using the same wirepath continues to work.</p> <p>I noticed if I reboot the nodes, the first LXCs to get a connection are the ones that are up first. Once it gets to the 10th(ish) one, they take longer to connect to the internet. Kinda seems like theres maybe a limit to how many IP addre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m looking for seems so simple, I must just not be using the right search terms.</p> <p>I started using Navidrome a while back to stream my own music collection, and it&#39;s quite useful. One feature I took some time to investigate was its &quot;Radio&quot; section, where you can specify a collection of URLs for streaming radio services and listen to them. Most client apps on phones allow access to this, making it a good alternative if you want something more &quot;live&quot; than your own music collection. I&#39;ve even found integrations between Sonos and Navidrome (Bonob) work with these radio channels too. However, the feature is buggy and very bare-bones. From some reading, it seems the team maintaining Navidrome view the radio feature as of minimal value, and they simply don&#39;t do much with it any more.

For example if I own <a href="http://boogerdomain.com">boogerdomain.com</a> proxmox says hey whats your fqdn, i think it defaults to pve.local, opnsense has a local domain I use <a href="http://home.arpa">home.arpa</a>, but since I own my own fqdn how would i utilize it here? Would it be like <a href="http://pve.server.boogerdomain.com">pve.server.boogerdomain.com</a> or something like that?
