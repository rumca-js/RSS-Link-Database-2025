While Chelsea relished in home comforts on this occasion, registering their 14th WSL win of the season against <strong>Leicester</strong>, Gareth Taylor\u2019s side faltered and could only return from Dagenham with a point against a resilient <strong>West Ham</strong>. Their 1-1 draw means they now sit 12 points off the top of the table.</p><p>Taylor cut a frustrated figure as his side failed to hold on to a 1-0 lead against the Hammers. A 91st-minute equaliser from Manuela Pav\u00ed cancelled out Khadija Shaw\u2019s opener to the delight of the hosts. Injury and loading caused both managers to change personnel, with the visitors in particular looking out of sorts.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/f",

For Vincent Kompany are cruising to the Bundesliga title and now they are cruising to the Champions League quarter-finals too. They may well sign Leverkusen\u2019s best player Florian Wirtz in the summer, but here they played him off the park. It feels like game over, and in more senses than one.</p><p>This week the Bayern director of sport Max Eberl made an eye-catching comparison. He compared Alonso and Vincent Kompany to Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the coaching duopoly that shaped modern football for almost a decade. Bit soon for all that, most people reckoned, but it feels just a little less fanciful now. The bloke who got Burnley relegated to the Championship may just be the next big thing in European coaching.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/05/champions-league-bayern-munich-bayer-leverkusen-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

Fittingly, Liverpool\u2019s goal was constructed by their goalkeeper. Alisson was unbeatable all night, driving PSG to despair with a string of superb saves, although Luis Enrique\u2019s side also squandered plenty of chances of their own accord.
