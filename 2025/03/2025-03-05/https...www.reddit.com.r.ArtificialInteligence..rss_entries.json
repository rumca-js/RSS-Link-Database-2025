A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2502.06559v1#S3\">meta-analysis published </a>less than a month ago outlines why benchmarks should be approached with caution. </p> <blockquote> <p>Another genre of benchmark critique focuses on the epistemological claims that tend to surround benchmarks and examines the limits of what can be known through quantitative AI tests. A central reference point in these discussions is the observation by Raji et al. (2021) that <strong>many benchmarks suffer from construct validity issues in the sense that they do not measure what they claim to measure.</strong> As the authors proclaim, this is especially troublesome when benchmarks promise to measure universal or general capabilities, since this vastly misrepresents the",

I know it&#39;s bad for the environment. I know it&#39;s starting to in-breed. I know there are whistblowers being killed because of genAI. And I&#39;ve read people saying they know AI won&#39;t last, it&#39;s not viable, it&#39;ll destroy itself. But how true is this? Is it really only a temporary menace? I feel hopeless and depressed. Everywhere I go I see people cheering that art is being stolen away from humans to produce more and cheaper products. And some will say &quot;it&#39;s not being stolen, you can still draw and sing and write!&quot; But how many of us can actually do that with our jobs and our studies? I just.
