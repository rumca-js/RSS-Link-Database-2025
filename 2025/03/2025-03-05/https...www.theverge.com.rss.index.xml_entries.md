<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Nvidia&rsquo;s dominance over the latest generation of graphics cards ends today. AMD might have surrendered the high end of the GPU market, but its new $549 Radeon RX 9070 and $599 RX 9070 XT look set to bring Nvidia back to reality, at least in the midrange.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple just updated the MacBook Air with an M4 processor, a new sky blue color option, and — most surprising of all — a lower price. The 13-inch starts at $999, while the 15-inch begins at $1,199. They’re available to order now and launch on March 12th.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After over a year and a half, Apple is updating the Mac Studio with a curious new quirk: it straddles two generations, with an M4 Max for the base model and an M3 Ultra for the upgraded model. You can preorder both versions at Apple’s site for $1,999 (M4 Max) and $3,999 (M3 Ultra), and they’ll be available to buy on March 12.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple says the M4 Max Mac Studio is “up to 3.5x faster” than the original M1 Max version, with a 14-to-16-core CPU and 32-to-40-core GPU.
