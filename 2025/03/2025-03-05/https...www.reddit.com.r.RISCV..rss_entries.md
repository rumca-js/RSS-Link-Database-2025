<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, </p> <p>I&#39;m a current undergrad student who is trying to play around with a RISC-V core as part of a school project. I am attempting to make a custom instruction set for 2x2 matrix multiplication, but am kind of lost on how to achieve this, so I turned here to ask for advice. I am using the IBEX core as a template as there are published papers about modifying the IBEX, but many of them are explain in high level detail. If anyone could give tips or tricks that would be appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Virus_4417"> /u/No_Virus_4417 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1j4g3jt/modifying_a_riscv_core_for_a_school_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1j4g3jt/modifying_a_riscv_core_for_a_school_project/">[comments]</a></span>
