<p>TV antennas are having something of a renaissance in the U.S. Buoyed by the ever-increasing costs of cable and streaming subscriptions, and additional channels enabled by the advent of digital TV, roughly one in five U.S. homes now rely on an antenna for their television. Beyond the cost of the antenna, all the channels are free, and you might even get a better picture than through a pay TV service.</p>



<p>When it comes to choosing an antenna, the selection is almost as wide as the programming you can receive, but if you do a little homework, you should be able to buy with confidence and ensure a good picture.</p>



<p>We’ll walk through the steps required to figure out what kind of antenna you need and what you might receive, then you can use <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/583544/the-best-tv-antennas.html">PCWorld’s buyer’s guide</a> to help

<p>Microsoft has once again made changes to Copilot, with the new version now being delivered to Windows 11 Insiders. The redesign is meant to rethink the experience from the ground up, and that means Copilot is now a native app that’s directly integrated into the operating system.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/03/04/microsofts-copilot-just-got-a-big-upgrade-on-windows-11-more-native-than-chatgpt-now/">Windows Latest</a>, initial testers say the new Copilot Windows 11 app works even better than the ChatGPT desktop app. This is mainly due to the fact that Copilot works and responds with almost no delays and requires much less memory.</p>

<p>You should be using a password manager. Data breaches happen often now—and that wealth of stolen info has made cracking passwords even easier. It’s not just the “password12345” variety at risk (despite <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2523532/you-should-change-your-password-it-sucks-according-to-nordpass.html">those being really common</a>), either, but also passwords with variations on a single password or that substitute numbers for letters. Even if you’re using unique, random passwords, storing them in a document or spreadsheet is not truly keeping them safe and secure.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3207185/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html">paid password managers</a> offer nice extras, a free password manager still protects you from the risks of using weak passwords (or worse, using the same one ev

<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2622690/microsoft-is-killing-skype-and-wants-you-to-switch-to-a-teams-app-nobody-uses.html">As announced last week</a>, Microsoft is officially discontinuing the Skype messaging service on May 5, 2025. Apparently, there wasn’t enough user interest to keep the once-iconic video call app alive.</p>



<p>If you’re one of the dwindling few who still uses Skype in 2025, you might be wondering what you can do going forward. Naturally, Microsoft recommends switching to Teams, which is free to use and conveniently installed on every Windows PC with Microsoft 365. But if you don’t want to use Teams, you have other options, too.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, an alarm sounded—security researchers at GitLab Threat Intelligence discovered a handful of Chrome extensions adding code in order to commit fraud, with at least 3.2 million users affected. But the add-ons didn’t start as malicious. Instead, they launched as legitimate software, only to be later compromised or sold to bad actors.</p>

<p>You’ve probably tracked a package from FedEx or the U.S. Postal Service, monitoring its progress as it nears your door. Intel is launching a similar program for its processors — but as they’re actually being made.</p>



<p>Intel announced what it’s calling the “Assured Supply Chain for Enterprises” as it unveils a ton of new commercial mobile processors for businesses, covering the Intel Core Ultra 200V, 200U, 200H, 200S, and even 200HX chips. Intel’s launch covers two separate architectures, from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2463714/tested-intels-lunar-lake-wants-you-to-forget-snapdragon-ever-existed.html">“Lunar Lake”</a> to it latest <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2592394/intels-new-laptops-cpus-last-forever-but-i-didnt-expect-the-performance-leap.html">“Arrow Lake”</a> processors for laptops. </p>

<p>Everyone knows them, everyone has them. USB sticks, or thumb drives, are ideal for quickly exchanging data between computers — but also for transporting digital content between mobile phones and PCs when the cloud is not an alternative.</p>



<p>Because they are so small, USB sticks are also very popular as promotional gifts or are quickly added to the shopping basket just before the checkout in the electronics store. </p>



<p>Trouble later arises because the stick turns out to be a bad buy. That’s why it’s worth knowing a little more about USB sticks. After all, we entrust our private and business data to these small data transporters. </p>
