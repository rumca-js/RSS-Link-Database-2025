I most definitely related to this movie in a way I couldn&#39;t with The Goonies. </p> <p>The four protagonists were quite exact in portraying the growing pains of these boys, each of them going through their own personal drama. </p> <p>We all knew the smart kid with a troubled home life, Gordie, or the troubled kid, Chris, who was actually a nice person but was misunderstood and was often the voice of reason, Teddy, the weird kid who acted out but was hiding a great deal of pain underneath and Vern, the fat kid who had a easier life compared to the rest and brought some endearing innocence into the group. I was probably closer to Vern as a kid, though I wish I was Gordie and I knew boys like Chris who I was initially afraid of but then they&#39;d be nice to me and I&#39;d want to be their friends.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Though not without some 80s cheese (some of the acting and dialogue can be rough), its flaws are forgiven for the sheer ambition. Think this movie handles momentum and impending doom as well as any horror film and the slow burn approach really works in its favour. </p> <p>I love horror films but I find very few of them to be truly unsettling. Sequences in Prince of Darkness just freak me out, though. Those recurring dream messages from the future with the distorted voice and low-budget VHS footage get under my skin, and the “YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED!” scene is just a masterclass of tension. </p> <p>I also think it has an all-timer ending. The dream sequence repeats once more and the ambiguity of it all (you’re not sure if the evil is still out there or not) is so well done. Prime example of show, don’t tell.</p> <p>While The Thing is the superior film, Prince of Darkness is scarier IMO. What do you all think of the movie? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

Yes, he is the title character and the main POV throughout most of the film, but he doesn&#39;t have a clear character arc.</p> <p>If anything, Cameron Fray, Ferris friend does. At the start of the film, Cameron is in bed sickly and not really confident in himself, but as the movie progresses, he starts to get more confidence, and by the end, he gains the courage to stand up to his father. </p> <p>It&#39;s kindof wholesome, actually.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Minute-Necessary2393"> /u/Minute-Necessary2393 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j46ytt/something_i_noticed_about_ferris_buellers_day_off/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/

When I saw La Dolce Vita in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom “the sweet life” represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamor, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello’s world; Chicago’s North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello’s age.</p> <p>When I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was an interesting action movie experience for me. It was good! Something especially notable was how men interacted with each other, being sensitive toward each other and openly expressing their emotions, crying lots of times. It was a refreshing departure from American media where I honestly just don&#39;t see anything like it happening. </p> <p>Typical gender norms sadden me. It&#39;s like years of cultural norms have stunted people&#39;s growth in so many ways when they otherwise could be processing their emotions in more authentic and likely healthier ways. Here in GMO you see companionship and empathy and it really displays an openness to the way the characters functioned as people. It was almost off-putting, yet their actions would perhaps be true to life, under those circumstances. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CloseCalls4walls"> /u/CloseCalls4walls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The term &quot;media literacy&quot; is often brought up in modern fiction discussion. It refers to the viewer&#39;s ability to decipher what the author actually really meant to say with their work, and what should be the &quot;correct&quot; interpretation of it.</p> <p>But most if not all examples of such works are ones where most people end up idolizing a certain character, but the whole point is supposed to be that you shouldn&#39;t idolize them. (Some examples being Tyler Durden in <em>Fight Club,</em> Patrick Bateman in <em>American Psycho</em> for some reason, Travis Bickle in <em>Taxi Driver,</em> etc. For works other than movies, I personally would also add Raskoljnikov from <em>Crime and Punishment</em> on that list.)</p> <p>Are there any movies that might be testing some different kind of media literacy, other than the aforementioned one?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just recently watched 20th Century Women by Mike Mills. And wow. It was quite affecting and emotional. Wonderful original score and soundtrack. Amazing acting, especially from Annette Benning and Greta Gerwig. I loved that it was about everything and nothing, showing a slice of life nostalgia trip encapsulating a portion of the late 1970s US. It sets the tone and feel very well. Any other movies that hit those same notes and *feel* like 20th Century Women?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Raydiatom"> /u/Raydiatom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3rhx6/movies_similar_to_20th_century_women/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3rhx6/movies_similar_to_20th_century_women/">[comments]</a></span>
