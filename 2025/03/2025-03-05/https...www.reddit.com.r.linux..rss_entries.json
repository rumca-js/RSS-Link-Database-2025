It proved generally usable as a daily driver this time, yet not without a bug here and there. Firefox and LibreOffice were especially affected.</p> <p>Recently I ran into a showstopper: Firefox started freezing for unpredictable periods at random moments. And guess what, forcing it and other affected apps to use Xorg (technically XWayland) cured the thing along with many other annoyances.</p> <ul> <li>Firefox no longer gives me wobbly text.</li> <li>Firefox correctly switches to foreground after I click a link in another app.</li> <li>LibreOffice Writer documents stopped scrolling to random positions in web view.</li> <li>And so on. After two days of testing I do not even remember all the bugs XWayland fixed for me.</li> </ul> <p>Overall, it&#39;s just another quality of life. Why not switch the whole KDE to Xorg and stop using crutches? Well, ",
