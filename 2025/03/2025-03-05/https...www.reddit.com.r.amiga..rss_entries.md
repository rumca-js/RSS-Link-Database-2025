<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an amiga 1200 with AGA installed on Winuae. If I do a new RTG installation, will it have any difference in game graphics? For example, an AGA game will have better graphics in Config with RTG or will I need to find a special RTG version as with AGA/ECS game versions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/denis1276"> /u/denis1276 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j485a0/amiga_1200_aga_vs_rtg_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j485a0/amiga_1200_aga_vs_rtg_games/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Retro Games Ltd a couple months ago posted the roadmap for this year, stating that a new full-sized Amiga console was coming out in Q1 of 2025. Now march has come, and they didn&#39;t even fully announce the console (we don&#39;t even know whether it will be A500, A600, A1200, CD32, or any other Amiga console for that matter), which makes me suspect that the launch of the aforementioned system will be further delayed. Does anyone have any kind of news about this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent_Effort994"> /u/Maleficent_Effort994 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j40h4x/is_the_new_amiga_maxi_actually_coming_out/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j40h4x/is_the_new_amiga_maxi_actually_coming_out/">[comments]</a></span>
