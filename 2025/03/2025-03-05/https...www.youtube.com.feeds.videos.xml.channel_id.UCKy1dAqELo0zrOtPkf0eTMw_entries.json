        "description": "Daredevil: Born Again series premiere reviewed by Joshua Yehl. Streaming on Disney+.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again does a bang up job with ol\u2019 Hornhead\u2019s long-awaited return. The show captures the signature drama and brutality of Netflix\u2019s Daredevil series while taking the story of Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk in a bold (and surprisingly topical) new direction. It\u2019s to Marvel\u2019s credit that they\u2019ve set up such a gripping face-off not between Daredevil and Kingpin but between their civilian-facing personas. But for all the new show does right, there are still a few quibbles to be had \u2013 mainly, the lack of supporting characters who pop in these first two episodes and the fact that we are yet again getting a story about Murdock giving up being Daredevil.",
