So while the Dems pathetically paraded around in pink as if they care about women and families, that could not be further from the truth. </p><p>We are officially dealing with people who refuse to "stand for a young woman who was almost killed and severely injured by a man on the volleyball court." We are dealing with people who "couldn't stand for the mothers of two beautiful young women whose lives were taken tragically at the hands of illegal people." And we are dealing with people who refuse to "stand up for basic law and order & immigration reform." </p><p>It just so happens that the people who suffer the most from progressive politics are women and families. That is why Karoline Leavitt said what needed to be said.

	Tuesday was an embarrassing day for anyone who still identifies as a Democrat. It was a great day for those who profit from creating content about how much Democrats fail as a party and suck at life. But not so much for those who are one. And we aren't just talking about their silly behavior during Trump's speech. </p><p>Democrats kicked off the day with 23 cringetastic videos of them all repeating the same speech, and we now know the identity of the Senator who forgot how the internet works and thought this was a good idea.

By the end of the evening, it was clear Trump's constituents are America, and the Democrat constituency is a handle of very online far-left progressives who demand to live vicariously through performative outrage.</p><p>The odd thing is, it was reported in the media yesterday morning that there was an internal debate within the left about this. Some in the party believed it was best to act like grown-ups. Others wanted to throw a hissy fit to remind Americans watching why so many of them dislike the Democrat Party. The hissy fitters prevailed. And it all started with this woman holding a sign before Trump even began speaking.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">This is not normal. <a
