Scientists have discovered a strong link between Earth's tilt and past ice ages, predicting the next glacial period would have started in 11,000 years. However, rising greenhouse gas emissions are disrupting these natural cycles. The research, based on ocean sediment data, supports the theory that Earth's obliquity governs ice expansion while precession influences ice retreat. With human activity altering CO₂ levels, a new ice age may never occur, shifting Earth's climate trajectory permanently.

Researchers at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have set a new record by generating the highest-current, highest-peak-power electron beam ever recorded. The beam reached 100 kiloamps in just one quadrillionth of a second, achieved through advanced compression techniques and magnetic field manipulation. This breakthrough could have major implications for chemical research, plasma studies, and high-energy physics. Scientists believe the method could provide deeper insights into energy transfer processes and the nature of empty space. The findings have been published in Physical Review Letters.

## Primordial Helium-3 May Be Locked in Earth’s Core, Study Finds

Helium-3, an isotope formed during the solar system's birth, may be trapped in Earth's core, a study suggests. Researchers at the University of Tokyo found that helium can mix with iron at extreme heat and pressure, allowing it to remain in Earth's solid core. This discovery could help determine how quickly the planet formed, with a rapid formation timeline explaining helium’s retention. Further studies are needed to assess whether the liquid core could also store helium-3 over billions of years.

## Seafloor Spreading Slowdown May Have Caused 26–32m Sea Level Drop Over Millions of Years

Between 15 million and 6 million years ago, ocean crust production declined by 35 percent, leading to deeper ocean basins. This geological shift is believed to have caused a sea level drop of 26–32 meters. Research suggests that heat transfer from the mantle to the ocean decreased by 8 percent, potentially altering ocean chemistry. Some studies indicate that reduced volcanic activity during this time may have also influenced global cooling, contributing to further sea level changes. Evidence from coastal rock formations supports these findings.

A study suggests that Neanderthals experienced a population bottleneck 110,000 years ago, drastically reducing their genetic diversity. CT scans of their inner ear bones revealed a sharp decline in variation, indicating a drop in population size. This event may have made Neanderthals more vulnerable to environmental and competitive pressures, contributing to their eventual extinction. Researchers examined fossils from Spain, Croatia, France, Belgium, and Israel to track these genetic shifts. The findings provide new insights into the long-term challenges faced by Neanderthals.

Astronomers studying ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Hydra cluster have observed unexpected rotational movement in nearly half of the 30 galaxies examined. Spectroscopic data from the LEWIS programme, using the MUSE instrument on the Very Large Telescope, suggests that gravitational interactions with larger galaxies may influence their formation.

These findings reshape current understanding of UDG evolution and their role in galaxy clusters.
