But to really get the most out of a MacBook, we recommend adding a few accessories \u2014 both for your stay-put command center and your on-the-go setup. External keyboards and mice can improve your ergonomics, a webcam can enhance your video calls and a docking station lets you connect more than the built-in ports will allow. Here are the best MacBook accessories we\u2019ve used that may work for you too.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best",

        "description": "<p>To experience the true grandeur of the cinema in your house, nothing can top a projector. A good one can show a bright, sharp image up to 150 inches in size for an immersive experience that no TV can match \u2014 and often at a much lower price. Plus, they\u2019re great for gaming and can even be used as a second screen for your computer.<br><br>Projectors have gained popularity of late so there are tons of options to choose from. Classic models that mount on the ceiling are brighter and sharper than ever, and you can choose either bulbs or lasers as a light source depending on your budget. If you\u2019d rather mount one on the floor close to the screen, you can choose from dozens of ultra short throw (UST) models as well.<br><br>But compared to TVs, projectors remain a bit more confusing for a majority of buyers. This guide will fill you in on important details to consider like brightness, type (classic, portable and ultra short throw) and other factors to help you choose the best model for you",
