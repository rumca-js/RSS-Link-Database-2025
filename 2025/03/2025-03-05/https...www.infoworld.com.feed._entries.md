<p>C++ memory safety issues have come under heat recently, with rising interest in projects like <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3836025/trapc-proposal-to-fix-c-c-memory-safety.html">TrapC</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3526592/c-alliance-takes-aim-at-c-memory-safety.html">Safe C++</a> that attempt to tackle the issue. But C++ designer Bjarne Stroustrup remains steadfast in promoting profiles as essential for safety in C++.</p>



<p>Profiles can offer guarantees for imposing restrictions on existing features. In a February 7 note to ISO (International Organization for Standardization) C++ committee members, Stroustrup emphasized the benefits of profiles, noting that

<p>Python might not be the fastest of languages, but it has many advantages. Users enjoy Python’s convenience and development speed, as well as its broad ecosystem of libraries. Something else people appreciate about Python is how it bridges language ecosystems. Anything compiled to C, or that exposes a C-like interface, can be used with Python. That includes Zig—a language whose popularity is on the rise due to its native speed and relative safety. </p>



<p>You can use Zig to write libraries that work with Python, or to create full-blown Python extensions. In this article, we’ll quickly walk through the mechanics of both—but note they are very different processes. Writing <em>a </em>C-interface

<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about how a good software team will <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3820278/keep-your-code-open-to-possibilities.html">defer decisions</a> as long as possible. Smart teams will design and build systems that don’t lock them into any particular implementation until it is utterly necessary. (And even then, if they have done things right, they don’t have to lock themselves into anything…) This enables them to keep possibilities open and has the lovely result of driving a flexible, extensible design. </p>



<p>Critical to that, of course, is writing code that is flexible and not locked into any one implementation. This is where dependency injection comes in. I’ve

<p>While Java Development Kit 25 is not set to arrive until September, the first feature already has been proposed for it — a preview of a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/502">stable values API</a> that promises to improve startup of Java applications. </p>



<p>Stable values are objects that hold immutable data. Because stable values are treated as constants by the JVM, they allow for the same performance optimizations that are enabled by declaring a field <code>final</code>. At the same time, they offer greater flexibility as to the timing of initialization. Thus they could be used to improve the startup of Java applications by breaking up the monolithic initialization of application state.</
