My tour with The Darkness begins this week, so once again I'm away from my studio and in unfamiliar surroundings. Sebastian Murphy agreed to meet me there for a long form interview, which we'll bring you later this week. But ahead of that,  I wanted to check out Viagra Boys' latest release - Uno II. My very dear family friend, Danny Bolton joined me.

To watch Uno II without the pub chat: https://youtu.be/9kWgvEKIo4c?si=ir_5qvLGXE3TA_qX
