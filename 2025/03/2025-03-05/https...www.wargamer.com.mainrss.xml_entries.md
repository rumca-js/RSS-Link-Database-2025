								<p>A <strong>Pokémon V Union</strong> card is about as massive as a pocket monster can get. While the Pokémon TCG already added some gargantuan creatures to the Sword &amp; Shield series in the form of VMAX Pokémon, V Union soon proved that things can <em>always</em> be bigger. Whether you’re drawn to this type of card by its huge size, gorgeous art, or gameplay potential, we can tell you all you need to know about V Union Pokémon.</p>
<p>Before we jump into the world of <strong>V Union Pokémon</strong>, here’s a guide to the <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/most-powerful-pokemon">best Pokémon cards</a> that prove size isn’t everything.

								<p>The <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> card Inti, Seneschal of the Sun is starting to spike in price. This rare red card is still plenty cheap, but it has doubled in value since the latest set, Aetherdrift, came out, and still seems to be climbing. On February 14, the card cost $2, but now it’s up to $4.

								<p>The end of the ‘90s was a golden age for science fantasy supersoldiers, on the tabletop and on home computers. 1998 saw the release of <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> third edition and the iconic multipart Space Marine tactical squad kit, and then in 1999 the double whammy of Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament took LAN parties by storm.
