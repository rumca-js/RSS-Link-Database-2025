<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, </p> <p>I‚Äôve spent more than a year building <a href="https://www.quizwiz.app/">QuizWiz</a>, a trivia app with over 50.000 questions across dozens of topics. I‚Äôve hit 500 signups, but retention‚Äôs low‚Äîusers just aren‚Äôt sticking around. My motivation has taken a hit after putting in so much time and effort in the app and not seeing better results. </p> <p>So, I&#39;m weighing my options, should I:</p> <ul> <li>Push forward: Add daily challenges, rewards, and expand the game</li> <li>Pivot: Switch to education, license the content or something else.</li> </ul> <p>What I‚Äôd love to hear:</p> <ol> <li>How do you boost retention in apps like this?</li> <li>What keeps you coming back to trivia games?</li> <li>Pivot now or double down?</li> </ol> <p>If you‚Äôve been grinding on a project for a while too, I‚Äôd really value your perspective. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thequizwizard">

It&#39;s a free tool that lets you add cool, animated subtitles to your short videos, all right in your browser. No need to upload files or worry about privacy‚Äîeverything happens locally. No signup, no watermarks.</p> <p>The Backstory:</p> <p>There are a lot of statistics saying that huge numbers of people watch video without sound, or that subtitles dramatically increase the likelihood that viewers will watch to the end. I believed it because I read one such statistic in the thousandth video I ‚Äúread‚Äù word by word on youtube shorts. I realized that videos with dynamic subtitles really grab attention.</p> <p>There are quite a few tools on the market that do this, but when it comes to web applications, I haven&#39;t found anything that is free (without watermarks), works reasonably good for non-English-language videos, and doesn&#39;t scream ‚Äúbuy me‚Äù

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been a confident and outgoing person IRL but for some reason phone calls would just stress me out. It was a weird thing where I would have this script in my head of how it was going to go, and then when we actually get on the phone I&#39;d freeze up. </p> <p>I would procrastinate setting appointments or calling people back. I was terrified of calling a restaurant to set a reservation or to call on a follow up to check the status of something. Making a dentist appoint was impossible for me. Getting 3 bids from contractors? Forget about it, I wasn&#39;t even getting one. Disputing a bill? Also wasn&#39;t my reality. </p> <p>Eventually, I was able to break this cycle by working in sales and just making like seriously 1000 phone calls. Wasn&#39;t fun honestly but it worked. I&#39;m definitely comfortable on the phone now and can communicate quickly and efficiently with little phone induced anxiety. </p> <p>I still, in my personal life, pr

Initially, we spoke to some potential customers who were very excited to use the product and even pay for it. Our reason for building this was personal since I and my cofounder both faced this problem ourselves.</p> <p>Since I am a student, due to my college hectic schedule it took me some time to finally complete the MVP but even then we had no money to ship it. So we waited for about a month trying to figure out some money to handle our early adopters and start the feedback loop. But we couldn&#39;t. Now those same customers we were earlier very excited about are not even responding. I understand they might be busy or got a better solution. So, we thought to get some more users and this time we will directly onboard them. But to even support early adopters we need to take an upfront payment and then give them the access.</p> <p>My Question is-</

## 75 Hard, but for self-help books‚Äîwould you try this?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve always been into self-help books, but I realized I‚Äôd read them, feel motivated for a few days, and then nothing really changed. I‚Äôd take notes, highlight stuff, and still never actually apply what I learned.</p> <p>That‚Äôs when I started thinking‚Äîwhat if there was a structured way to actually implement the ideas from these books? Kind of like 75 Hard, but instead of fitness, it‚Äôs applying self-help books in a daily, actionable way.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Think &amp; Grow Rich Challenge</strong> ‚Äì Each day, you complete an action step based on Napoleon Hill‚Äôs principles.</li> <li><strong>Atomic Habits Challenge</strong> ‚Äì Instead of just reading about habits, you actually build them over 30 days.</li> </ul> <p>I‚Äôm working on building a tool that does this automatically. The idea is that you pick a book, and instead of just reading it, you get a daily challenge to actually apply what it teaches. Would you try this?</p> </div><!--

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know there are hundreds of apps to track expenses, but none of them ever really fit my needs as someone living in Mexico. Either they were built for the U.S./European market, overly complex, or too expensive. So, I finally decided to build my own.</p> <p>A bit of background: I‚Äôve been a Product Manager for the last six years, but I used to code before that. Over time, I stepped away from programming, and I always had that itch to get back into it. Then, at the start of this year, I got laid off (which, honestly, was a blessing‚ÄîI was completely burned out). That gave me the push I needed to try something new.</p> <p>Since I had been curious about SwiftUI for a while, I figured this was the perfect time to dive back into coding. But I also wanted to challenge myself: could I actually build and ship a product using ChatGPT as my coding assistant? Turns out‚Ä¶ yes! After two months of teaching myself SwiftUI, SwiftData, and a lot of prompting, I was able
