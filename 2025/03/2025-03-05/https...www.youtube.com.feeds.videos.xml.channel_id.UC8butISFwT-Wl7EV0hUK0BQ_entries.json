        "description": "Welcome to this intro to machine learning course. The course starts with the fundamentals, covering what machine learning is, how it differs from traditional approaches, and where it\u2019s used. It then dives deeper into the mechanics, exploring different models, algorithms, and training processes. Next, it introduces Generative AI, explaining how it creates new content, before wrapping up with the architecture of AI systems and how to design and deploy them effectively.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Rola Dali created this course.
