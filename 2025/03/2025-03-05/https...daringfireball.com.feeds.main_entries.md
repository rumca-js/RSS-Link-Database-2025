<p>Mark Gurman, yesterday at noon ET:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not an “Air” — but the new Mac Studio, codenamed J575,
appears to be imminent. It could be announced as early as this
week along with the new MacBook Airs. There are signs these will
come with an M4 Max but that its new Ultra chip will actually be
an M3 Ultra.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the scoop breaking this news after Apple started briefing media about it under NDA.</p>

## Trump 2.0 Is More Idiocracy Than Kakistocracy

<p>Ron Filipkowski:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trump’s Sec of Agriculture Brooke Rollins says the solution to
high egg prices for Americans is to get some chickens and raise
them in your backyard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No exaggeration. She’s selling the idea of everyone raising chickens in their back yards as “awesome”, with a laugh and a smile. And then the Fox News host (Rachel Campos-Duffy — wife of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy — this whole world is comprised of socially-inbred reality-TV has-beens), smiling and laughing, concludes with “I think everyone who isn’t a farmer right now wants to be, so you’re in the right department, Brooke!”</p>

<p>This is a cult. No sense of “<em>Hey, maybe this egg situation wasn’t so simple. Maybe this blowhard president</em> isn’t <em>going to solve the bird flu and halt inflation on day one...</em>” — as they check their calendar and see that we’re already up to day 43 and their supermarket hasn’t had any eggs, at any price, in a week. No, i

<p>Funny piece — if your surname isn’t “Null” — by Oyin Adedoyin for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AsGIvBkziTEqE5V7eOvF-Tg">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even those without the last name Null are finding themselves
caught in the void. Joseph Tartaro got a license plate with the
word “NULL” on it nearly 10 years ago. The 36-year-old security
auditor thought it would be funny to drive around with the symbol
for an empty value. Maybe a police officer who tried to give him a
ticket would end up writing null into the system and not be able
to process it, he joked to himself.</p>

<p>In 2018 he paid a $35 parking ticket. Soon afterward, he said, his
mailbox was flooded with hundreds of traffic tickets for incidents
he hadn’t been involved in. Tickets were from other counties and
cities for vehicles of different colors, makes and models. A
database had associated the word “null” with his personal
information and citations were sent to Tartaro, who lives in L

<p>Ben Stiller, in a delightful piece for The New York Times on working up the gumption to tell Gene Hackman — with whom he was working in Wes Anderson’s excellent <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>, his favorite Hackman movie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“ … but I have to say for me, there is one movie you made that
means so much to me. It might sound crazy, but I think it’s the
reason I wanted to make movies. It’s ‘The Poseidon Adventure.’ It
literally was my favorite movie when it came out. I think I was 7
or something and I went to see it in the theater about 10 times,
then watched it repeatedly whenever it was on TV. It was so
formative, and you were so good in it, and it just for me was my
favorite movie for so long because of the excitement of that
incredible score and those actors and the action and just all of
it. It really changed my life and just … made me want to make
movies.”</p>

<p>He smiled a little. He looked forward, thinking, perhaps about the
movie, as if it hadn’t crossed
