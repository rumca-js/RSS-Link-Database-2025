<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a project that for my engineering capstone that I have been working on and we have multiple processes that need to run in parallel. I have a GUI, 3 sensors, and a motor driver that all need to be ran in parallel using multi-threading. This is my first time using a raspberry pi, and so far it&#39;s been working well, however as far as I know we have a maximum of 4 threads that can run at a time (RPi 3b+) and we need 5. Is there a way to &quot;get&quot; more threads? If we connected a second raspberry pi would we have more threads to utilize and communicate between all of them? For a little context we need the motor driver running through pwm, and the 3 sensors all need to be running in parallel and communicating to correctly count cycles (IR break beam) and detect changes at any given point (current and vibration sensors). This all needs to run at the same time while a GUI is also running and displaying these values. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &
