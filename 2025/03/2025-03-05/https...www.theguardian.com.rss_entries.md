<ul><li>Chelsea back to winning ways as they beat Leicester 3-1</li><li>Gareth Taylor’s side concede late leveller at West Ham</li></ul><p>Manic March has certainly begun for <strong>Chelsea</strong> and <strong>Manchester City</strong> and the packed schedule is clearly taking its toll on both. While Chelsea relished in home comforts on this occasion, registering their 14th WSL win of the season against <strong>Leicester</strong>, Gareth Taylor’s side faltered and could only return from Dagenham with a point against a resilient <strong>West Ham</strong>. Their 1-1 draw means they now sit 12 points off the top of the table.</p><p>Taylor cut a frustrated figure as his side failed to hold on to a 1-0 lead against the Hammers. A 91st-minute equaliser from Manuela Paví cancelled out Khadija Shaw’s opener to the delight of the hosts. Injury and loading caused both managers to change personnel, with the visitors in particular looking out of sorts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/f

<p>Raphinha struck a second-half winner to give Barcelona a lion-hearted 1-0 victory at Benfica on Wednesday as they overcame a red card for Pau Cubarsí early in the game to steal an advantage in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.</p><p>Barcelona’s teenage defender Cubarsí was given a straight red card for a last-man foul on Vangelis Pavlidis in the 22nd minute, but the visitors hung on with goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny putting in a brilliant performance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/05/champions-league-benfica-barcelona-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Kane at the double as Bayern ease to first-leg win against 10-man Leverkusen

<p>Something seemed to break here, and it was not just Xabi Alonso’s proud unbeaten record over Bayern Munich. For Vincent Kompany are cruising to the Bundesliga title and now they are cruising to the Champions League quarter-finals too. They may well sign Leverkusen’s best player Florian Wirtz in the summer, but here they played him off the park. It feels like game over, and in more senses than one.</p><p>This week the Bayern director of sport Max Eberl made an eye-catching comparison. He compared Alonso and Vincent Kompany to Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp, the coaching duopoly that shaped modern football for almost a decade. Bit soon for all that, most people reckoned, but it feels just a little less fanciful now. The bloke who got Burnley relegated to the Championship may just be the next big thing in European coaching.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/05/champions-league-bayern-munich-bayer-leverkusen-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liverpool are alive and well in the Champions League when they should have been buried in Paris. Arne Slot’s team did not simply secure a precious first-leg lead against Paris Saint-Germain, they committed grand larceny on a night that belonged to Alisson.</p><p>Harvey Elliott grabbed a late winner entirely against the run of play and within a minute of replacing Mohamed Salah. Fittingly, Liverpool’s goal was constructed by their goalkeeper. Alisson was unbeatable all night, driving PSG to despair with a string of superb saves, although Luis Enrique’s side also squandered plenty of chances of their own accord. A goalless draw would have been a fine outcome for Liverpool in the circumstances but they emerged victorious when Alisson launched a clearance in the 87th minute.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/05/champions-league-psg-liverpool-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

In A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story, Lucy Boynton brings it to the small screen once again, playing the woman sentenced to death for shooting her lover, David Blakely, outside the Magdala pub in Hampstead, north-west London. It is a sad and complex story, and while the performances are excellent, this solid four-parter can only march them grimly towards their inevitable conclusion.</p><p>It begins on the day of Ellis’s execution, in 1955, as she refuses an offer

<p>The frontman of the J Geils Band has had an extraordinary life, living and working with celebrities along the way, detailed in a fascinating new book</p><p>During the peak of the pandemic, when many musicians spent their time writing songs, Peter Wolf did nothing but read. During that prolonged period of isolation and uncertainty, he comforted himself by devouring shelves full of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books">books</a>, including memoirs penned by other musicians. “After a while all those memoirs started to seem the same,” he said. “And I came to the realization that, unless you were a huge fan of that musician, the details of their story wouldn’t seem particularly captivating.”</p><p>Such thoughts had a major impact on Wolf when he was approached to tell his own story. As a result, his new book, titled Waiting on the Moon, threads the outlines of a memoir – highlighted by his years fronting the hit group J Geils Band – through a host of colorful anecdotes about what

<p>The Trump administration’s tariffs have sparked tension with co-hosts Canada and Mexico.

Formed in 2016, Bloodywood flavour the conventions of nu-metal with traditional Indian instruments, meaning their songs are as likely to feature crunching riffs as they are the flute or the dhol. The trio – bulked out to a six-piece on stage – became viral sensations covering pop songs and alternative hits on YouTube before writing original material. From there, their fortunes soared.

Using the actor’s own home movie footage, shot on lovely 16mm, plus new interviews with those close to him, including director Paul Verhoeven, actor Whoopi Goldberg, and his second wife Ineke ten Kate, a portrait emerges of a talented no-bullshit actor who fell slightly short of his potential due to Hollywood not being sure quite what to do with him. To be honest, that’s more or less what most people who are aware of Hauer thought of him already, so it’s not the case that this adds all that much to the narrative.</p><p>The home movie archive is previousl

It’s a dish that originates from the royal kitchens of the Begum of Bhopal in the 19th century and, as such, has always been a bit of a culinary statement – both a creative experiment and a showcase of refined taste, though, despite its unusual spice profile, the method is simple and unpretentious.

What the city prides itself on is that the Brothers Grimm grew up here in the late 18th century before they started publishing folk tales such as Cinderella and The Frog Prince.

<p>Cole was a black South African photographer whose work illuminated the reality of life under apartheid, but Raoul Peck’s excellent documentary unearths a life of exile and homesickness</p><p>Haitian film-maker Raoul Peck won an Oscar nomination for his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck">2016 documentary I Am Not Your Negro</a> about James Baldwin, whose writings were voiced by Samuel L Jackson; now he takes a comparable approach to a more elusive and in some ways more complex subject. This is the black South African photographer Ernest Cole whose fierce pictures of life under apartheid brought this political reality home to the US and the west, and played a real part in the pressure brought to bear on the South African government. But it was Cole’s terrible destiny to live as a stateless exile, mostly in the US, finally dying penniless in 1990 just as Nelson Mandela was being released.</p><p>Cole died of pancr

<p>The Fife coastal path connects the firths of Forth and Tay and takes in some of the country’s finest seaside villages, seascapes and the home of a famous literary castaway</p><p>Standing in a Scottish seaside village, I am confronted by two smart red doors and a curious figure standing in a niche above them: a man, one hand clutching a staff, the other shading his eyes as he gazes out to sea. There’s a flintlock pistol in his belt and he’s dressed in tattered rags. Is it a tribute to locals who survived a night out in Kirkcaldy? No, there is a weathered plaque that I can just read: “In memory of Alexander Selkirk, mariner, the original of Robinson Crusoe …”</p><p>This is the site of a cottage where Selkirk was born in 1676.
