My first game was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherminggames/re-act-the-arts-of-war">Re;ACT - The Arts of War</a> and it was delivered last year. Unfortunately I&#39;ve taken preorders for 2 smaller projects with around 1000 preorders total that are currently in manufacturing.</p> <p>With the recent increase on tariffs from the new 10% to now 20%, I am going to be facing a real cash flow issue.</p> <p>As you&#39;ve probably heard, margins in board games are very thin. For context, Re;ACT cost me over $88,000 to manufacturer and another $23,000 to import. a 20% tariff would&#39;ve meant I needed to suddenly pay another $22,000 to the US government to import the games.</p> <p>Re;ACT raised just under $200,000 on kickstarter. With 12% going to KS, payment processors and backerkit as the pledge manager off the top, $30,000 going to taxes (because I was a cash basis business not accrual), a

While characters have many abilities, some of them are usually not available because they require potions to be used, and overall gameplay is usually just &quot;move to most dangerous character and smash it&quot;.</p> <p>Besides, it is boring to be Consul (local Overlord), because he does not have any action cards to play, unlike many others 1 vs many games: only spawns and control

## I’m looking to create my own “abandoned island” board game

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey board gamers of Reddit ! I am attempting to make my own board game from scratch with the theme of abandoned island survival/escape My ideas so far are character cards with attribute ratings which include •physical strength •hunting skills •moral integrity •crafting skills •ingenuity •leadership skills The other side of the character card would be variable stats like health, hunger, thirst, etc. </p> <p>I’m looking to have 4 different areas of terrain on the island- water, desert, mountain, and jungle. I have ideas so far on resources and dangers found in each terrain but I’m struggling to find the ways to make for strategic game play rather than just chance by cards drawn and dice rolled. Character cards and inventory will be dealt between players at the start of the game. That’s about all I have so far. I have no game creating experience. Any advice would be appreciated!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I am thinking of games where the RNG is so high or the general gameplay is so chaotic that you can&#39;t employ traditional strategies or tactics towards victory, and if you do happen to win you rarely feel that you earned it, but rather that it found you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/squeakyboy81"> /u/squeakyboy81 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j3qrsh/what_is_your_favourite_game_where_you_dont_win_so/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j3qrsh/what_is_your_favourite_game_where_you_dont_win_so/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never played it, but thought I&#39;d wait for the 10th Anniversary Edition to pick it up. The high end is $250, which is giving me some sticker shock.

And do you think it&#39;s worth the price for the super deluxe?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aeshni"> /u/Aeshni </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j3pnjt/so_champions_of_midgard/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j3pnjt/so_champions_of_midgard/">[comments]</a></span>
