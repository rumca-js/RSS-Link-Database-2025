And I&#39;ll structure it, come up with a format, audit the SEO.</p> <p>I would prefer to do a subdomain, test a few and see how it goes. But then I loose out on their main domain authority which is very high. They own a large chunk of one of the most competitive niches (health). </p> <p>I&#39;ve told them that we maybe just should do Youtube, but they want a site with branding etc.</p> <p>Anyone done something similar, or have any feedback.
