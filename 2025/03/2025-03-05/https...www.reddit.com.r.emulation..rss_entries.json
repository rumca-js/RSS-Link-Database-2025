Gopher64 is already very good! It plays the entire commercial library, as well as Libdragon homebrew ROMs.</p> <p>However, I am not a very good GUI developer, and the GUI could use work. The emulator is written in Rust. This is a great opportunity for someone looking for a project! I honestly do not care what approach is taken. If you want to delete the current GUI entirely and write something new, great! If you want to re-work what is already there, also great! Please reach out to me on Github or Discord if you want to contribute, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gopher_64\"> /u/gopher_64 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1j4baz6/gopher64_needs_a_new_gui_can_you_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr",
