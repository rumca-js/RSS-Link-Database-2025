Users enjoy Python\u2019s convenience and development speed, as well as its broad ecosystem of libraries. Something else people appreciate about Python is how it bridges language ecosystems. Anything compiled to C, or that exposes a C-like interface, can be used with Python. That includes Zig\u2014a language whose popularity is on the rise due to its native speed and relative safety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Zig to write libraries that work with Python, or to create full-blown Python extensions.
