<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Readers,</p> <p>For the past couple of weeks, I&#39;ve been working on a side project of mine which is a desktop app built using modern tech stacks for RSS/Atom Reading. The project is full opensource and built targeting OS platforms - including Mac, Windows and Linux (Maybe Android in the future). </p> <p>I wanted to build something like this for quite some time now and finally got the chance. It supports currently Custom Feed options, basic UI management, and direct reading of feeds. I plan to continue working on this app in the future and have some plans in the backlog for the project. But in addition, I wanted to share this project here in this community and get some valuable feedbacks/criticisms/etc so that I can incorporate into my app. </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rahuldshetty/reader-project">https://github.com/rahuldshetty/reader-project</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Y

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have about 3 rss feeds that I&#39;d like to see daily in a really simple way. My preferred way would be to do this in a firefox extension (with feeds being synced for my other devices) or a website with an account. </p> <p>platform: linux, firefox. </p> <p><strong>Which solution would you recommend?</strong></p> <p>Bonus: if it is free, has sync, allows me to filter and search. Lifetime membership can also be an option. </p> <p>So far I&#39;ve just installed some FOSS reader on my phone and checked that. Would prefer to find something that I can use on a PC, without having to install an extra app on linux. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/qUxUp"> /u/qUxUp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1j488pv/what_sort_of_rss_reading_solution_do_you_use/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1j488pv/what_sort_of_rss_reading_solution_do_yo
