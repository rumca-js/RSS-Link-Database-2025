In today&#39;s political climate I thought I&#39;d re-watch this movie to get a better understanding of what Watergate was all about and how the press played a role in it. The fact that Woodward and Bernstein had to do so much work to put all the pieces together with the help of &quot;Deep Throat&quot; was a real eye opener especially the phone books. I enjoyed them trying to figure out how to get the information and then verify it. When they realize towards the end just how big of a deal this is the suspense and paranoia picks up a bit.</p> <p>Overall great movie! Great acting by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman! Great directing by Alan J. Pakula!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/El_Green\"> /u/El_Green </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

Love also made The Firm, another film about hooliganism. </p> <p>This movie, again about hoolignasm, was seen as a spiritual successor to The Football Factory (TFF) . They put a great trailer together which really convinced me to watch the movie. It was basically Dyer doing his own cockney geezer shtick and I, like many fans, find him very amusing. I respect the fact he&#39;s done so well in an industry mired in class disparity and nepotism. </p> <p>So, I was convinced to see the movie, in part hoping it was a worthy successor to TFF (wishful thinking) and in a bid to support a lower budget British comedy as I&#39;d like to see more of them in the cinema.</p> <p>Well, it turns out t",
