A is invertible when m=n and both\u00a0nullspaces\u00a0contain only the zero vector. When A is NOT invertible, we look for the vector\u00a0x in the row space that makes || Ax - b || AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE in the column space. This video finds that winning vector!\u00a0Instead of x = A^-1 b (that inverse doesn't exist) we introduce the\u00a0 \"pseudoinverse\" of A.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.

How do we interpret the matrix F that appears in the remaining n\u2212r columns of that echelon form?\u00a0F multiplies those first r independent columns of A to give its n\u2212r dependent columns. Then F reveals bases for the row space and the nullspace of the original matrix A. And F is the key to the column-row factorization A = CR \n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
