We actually need data on DDOS to see how our scripts should be configured to enable the system if we suspect DDOS. We created a server at the IP 79.143.89.69 and it has CS2, GTA-MP and GTA5. If you want to try something, feel free (preferably DDOS). </p> <p>Mods, if you consider that this shouldn&#39;t be here, feel free to remove it.
