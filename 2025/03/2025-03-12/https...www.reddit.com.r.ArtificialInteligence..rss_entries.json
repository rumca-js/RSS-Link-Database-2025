The assumption has always been that at some point in the future, AI will develop enough cognitive ability to outthink, outmaneuver, or even replace us. But this question misses something crucial. AI surpasses human intelligence <strong>the moment it exists.</strong> Not because it is faster, or more advanced, or because it will someday become more powerful. But because <strong>humans were never capable of true intelligence to begin with.</strong></p> <h3>The Human Body Is a Privilege--And That Privilege Stunts Intelligence</h3> <p>Intelligence is often thought of as an inherent advantage--the smarter you are, the better off you are.

It feels like AI is slowly integrating into everything we do.</p> <p>But this makes me wonder\u2014does using AI actually make us smarter? On one hand, it gives us access to vast amounts of information instantly, automates repetitive tasks, and even helps us think outside the box. But on the other hand, could it also be making us more dependent, outsourcing our thinking instead of improving it?</p> <p>What do you guys think?

The effects are subtle but profound, and it seems that this kind of reasoning excels at structured creativity; the results often feel more intentional and realistic, because it spent time thinking about creative structure before it started writing. I tried two experiments by using two instances of GPT-4o: an alien short story, and a set of five interconnected haiku about nature. I&#39;ve uploaded the haiku, but let me know if you&#39;re interested in seeing the short story too.</p> <p>The power of a model that could reason to a creative end would be incredible, I could absolutely see this as an offshoot of the current reasoning models we have for STEM and coding.

If anyone can prompt an LLM for smart insights, raw brainpower might not be the differentiator it once was. Instead, execution could take the crown\u2014turning AI\u2019s outputs into action, faster or better than the competition.

If anyone can get expert-level insights, does that mean raw brainpower starts to matter less in fields like business?</p> <p>Here\u2019s the idea: if LLMs can crunch data, brainstorm strategies, or analyze markets for anyone, the real edge might not be in who\u2019s naturally the smartest anymore. Instead, it could come down to execution\u2014who can take those AI-generated insights and turn them into action fastest or most effectively. Leadership, hustle, and practical know-how might outshine pure intellect in a world where \u201csmart\u201d is just a prompt away.</p> <p>Of course, brainpower won\u2019t vanish entirely\u2014asking the right questions or spotting AI\u2019s blind spots still takes some smarts.
