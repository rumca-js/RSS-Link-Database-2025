Green Hell.. good grief, not only are you forced to play with white hands and arms, you are forced to play with BRIGHT, almost luminous white hands and arms, swear those hands are a light source. But thats why i gave up on that game and didnt buy it. </p> <p>There are exceptions of course, like those assasins creed games, and hitman etc but when the option is feasible, surely its not difficult to implement. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",

I&#39;m using a PSVR2 headset. Before the PSVR2 I owned an HP Reverb G1 and my VR performance was better all around Performance even on my RTX 2080 on the G1 with FS2020 was better. I swapped over to the PSVR2 and everything went downhill. Instantly thought my 3080 wasn&#39;t good enough to push the VR2. Upgraded to the 5070Ti and it&#39;s the same. </p> <p>Steam VR settings are set to 120Hz with motion smoothing off. I had the res scale set to 68%. But the performance doesn&#39;t change whether I increase or decrease it. Mind you this is with LOW SETTINGS in FS 2020 lol </p> <p>Am I missing something here?
