        "description": "On the twentieth anniversary of National Geographic\u2019s Academy-Award Winning \u201cMarch of The Penguins\u201d, SECRETS OF THE PENGUINS changes everything we ever believed to be true. From the Emperor Penguins\u2019 revelatory bonds of friendship to the gritty resolve of Gentoos and Rockhoppers, and the astonishing ingenuity of the migrant penguins that reached deserts and far beyond, their incredible traditions and societies echo ours in ways we never dreamt possible \u2013 until now. For over two years, BAFTA and Emmy Award-winning wildlife cinematographer Bertie Gregory collaborates with world leading scientists, using cutting-edge camera technology and unique access to capture three world-first episodes that resonate with our lives like never before. The three-part series is executive produced by National Geographic Explorer-at-Large and Academy Award\u00ae-winning filmmaker James Cameron.\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: http://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly",
