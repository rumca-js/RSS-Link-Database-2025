        "description": "Post Trauma is an indie horror game releasing later this month for PC and consoles. This game is a clear ode to classic PS1 survival horror titles like Resident Evil and Silent Hill and isn\u2019t shy about its inspiration in the slightest. \n\nWhat really helps sell Post Trauma\u2019s classic appeal are the fixed camera angles which shift from different angles to static CRTV perspectives depending on the context. \n\nThere\u2019s also plenty of slow-paced puzzles that you\u2019ll have to figure out the old fashioned way: through exploration. Environments range from  creepy rooms to spooky hallways. If you\u2019re a fan of creative enemy designs and methodical Silent Hill style gameplay, Post Trauma may just end up as your next favorite game in the horror genre.",

        "description": "Though some are bemoaning the end of the console war now that first-party Microsoft titles appear on other platforms, that doesn't necessarily mean the end of their hardware ambitions. There's always been the assurance that new Xbox consoles are coming in the future, and according to rumors, it could pursue a multifaceted approach.\n\nReports indicate that a portable gaming PC with Xbox \"design sensibilities\" is in the works for launch later this year. While the company throws its hat into the handheld PC gaming space with a distinct advantage, it's allegedly working on the successor to the Xbox Series X/S. Nothing is known about the console, save for it also having a handheld and different controller types (though it's out in 2027).\n\nWhile pursuing console hardware may seem questionable given Xbox's declining hardware sales, it could be part of Microsoft's effort to ensure multiple platforms and capture the widest possible audience.",

        "description": "That we are finally receiving a Assassin\u2019s Creed game set in Japan is obviously cause for celebration, but funnily enough, its promise of a detailed and immersive open world feudal Japan map is one that other major AAA titles have already made and fulfilled in recent years. \n\nBoth Ghost of Tsushima and Rise of the Ronin filled that void that Assassin\u2019s Creed was (until now) refusing to fill- though it\u2019s fair to say that both did it with very different results. Sucker Punch\u2019s 2020 modern classic did so in convincing fashion, while Rise of the Ronin stumbled with significant issues, even if it did have its fair share of strengths as well. Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows can take key lessons from both, however, and here, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll be discussing.",
