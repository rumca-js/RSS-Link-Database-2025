        "description": "Introducing Fracture Point, a fast-paced FPS that blends roguelike with looter-shooter mechanics. Players must fight through procedurally generated floors of a corporate skyscraper, battling security forces, mercenaries, and bosses while scavenging gear and trading loot at the base to enhance their character. Set in a realistic dystopian metropolis engulfed in a war between a powerful corporation and the resistance, the game delivers an intense and immersive experience. It reminds us a bit of Criterion's classic PS2-era first-person shooter Black. Wishlist Fracture Point on Steam if you're interested: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560110/Fracture_Point/",

        "description": "Capcom was on its knees after Resident Evil 6, now Monster Hunter Wilds is cementing its golden era - here's how it did it! Monster Hunter Wilds has recently broken records on Steam and the Resident Evil game series is more popular than ever thanks to RE Village and a handful of stellar remakes including Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 2. It\u2019s almost as if Capcom is incapable of failure... but that wasn\u2019t always the case. \n\nLess than a decade ago, following a bunch of critical and commercial flops, Capcom had lost its way and its audience.
