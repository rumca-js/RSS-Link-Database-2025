This is all for relatively casual purposes on my small YT channel (Nothing super serious)</p> <p>I have <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082XTKN7L?ref=ppx_pt2_dt_b_prod_image\"><strong>this RCA splitter</strong></a> which I will be using to split the signal from my snes to my CRT and capture card respectively. I am between two options from this point.</p> <p>FIrst option is <strong>ordering the replacement component adapter for the C875</strong> to capture the signal through the card that way. Only caveat is that it may take a while to ship as I would be ordering the single part from another seller with a knockoff card from AliExpress. Other threads have at least confirmed the compatibility.</",

I could also get bargains which are much harder to find now . It seems to be more about displaying and owning rarer or more expensive items than playing the games nowadays . Does anyone feel it&#39;s a shame as these games were made to be played , not kept on a shelf ? I am guilty of this as I no longer play my Castlevania SOTN on PS1 with audio CD and art book though I used to ( I bought it for about \u00a320 on release ). Now I play it elsewhere (Xbox 360 usually)and keep this stored away . If it&#39;s value hadn&#39;t been so distorted I would probably still be playing my original disk as I do with less valuable games. Can I just add , I&#39;m not talking about the massive rise in emulation and ROMs but actuallly collecting / playing original games on original hardware. Please discus",
