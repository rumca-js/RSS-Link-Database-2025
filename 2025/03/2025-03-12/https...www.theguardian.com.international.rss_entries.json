The protagonist, Uma, sits idly with her neighbour Sheetal outside their adjoining homes in Mumbai. To pass the time, the bored housewives pretend to be divorcing one another. Amid the role play, Uma turns to her confidant and says: \u201cI\u2019m tainted goods, I\u2019m a divorcee. But it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll wear this like a badge and go forth to the hills, form a manless nation and build a monolithic altar to the pussy.\u201d</p><p>The statement captures what is so provocative about the film \u2013 it turns societal norms on their head and dares to ask: what if we did things differently? At its core, the film feels quite feminist. \u201cThat word comes up a lot,\u201d says director Karan Kandhari. \u201cI\u2019m happy people can see the film like that, but I didn\u2019t set out to make someth",
