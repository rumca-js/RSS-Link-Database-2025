In Japan\u2019s Tokushima Prefecture, only a handful of masters carry on the eight-century-old art of making a unique form of indigo dye called sukumo.

Because of this, the denim industry uses about 55,000 tons of synthetic indigo a year, relegating natural indigo to niche uses like limited-edition items.
