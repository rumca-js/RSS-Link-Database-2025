Also the relationship needs to be equally toxic on both ends\ud83d\ude21. She threatens to kill his whole family, he scoffs and jokes about them already being dead while she casually chills in the backseat like he didn&#39;t just kidnap her. </p> <p>Next oddly specific book recommendations.

I don&#39;t think this is realistic nor desirable. Instead, I think it&#39;s important for us to focus on ourselves as individuals that may be influenced by culture but have the power of choosing to design a relationship in the way that we want. Also, I think that within a culture, there exist lots of differences that make it impossible to perceive culture as a monolithic ruleset that can be exchanged.</p> <p>They asked me for a book on the topic. Can someone recommend one that takes into account the points above? It can be fictional or non-fictional.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rrtgrrl\"> /u/rrtgrrl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j96swo/book_for_intercultural_relationship/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
