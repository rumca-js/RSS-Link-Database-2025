Oh, and I&#39;ve been getting into VRR on Windows, which DE supports it best? KDE or GNOME or it doesn&#39;t matter? And how is input lag on other DEs?

I found it really hard to game on and reverted back to win10 briefly, but then asked AI about what would be the best distro for me with gaming in mind considering my specs (RX6600, Ryzen 5 5600X, 32GB RAM) - the result was Nobara (which I&#39;ll admit I&#39;d never heard of prior to this conversation.) </p> <p>All I&#39;m here to say is that I really enjoy it. I hadn&#39;t even heard of Proton GE until this distro (admittedly I&#39;m a pleb and don&#39;t read forums, just raw-dog new distros and ask AI for help with terminal etc) - DBD runs amazingly with no loss of frames, other OLD titles like Star Wars: Battlefront 2 (the OG one), freaking Soul Reaver (original, not remaster) Metr",

I really like this engine; it works well, but sadly, it doesn&#39;t support Linux and is closed source.</p> <p><strong>Why ship Wine instead of letting users use Lutris/Steam?</strong> </p> <p>You can always use Lutris or Steam with Wine/Proton if you prefer, and it will be sup",
