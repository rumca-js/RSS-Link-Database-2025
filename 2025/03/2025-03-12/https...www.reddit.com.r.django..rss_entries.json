Editing these types of files is cumbersome, particularly when working in larger teams. We faced numerous merge conflicts, poor readability, difficulty in maintenance, and limitations such as only being able to match one string directly to another. In a lot of use cases, you simply cannot translate a sentence and hope it always matches the context of that specific view.</li> <li>To address some of the issues mentioned above, we built our own database-driven translation system. Essentially, it uses a model that pairs view identifiers with key identifiers, allowing us to fetch specific translations in views or through template tags. So it&#39;s more like a CMS, I guess. The system was carefully designed",
