Although this may feel like an isolated issue for a small list of old games, we think it speaks to a potentially broader concern of intercompatibility and vendor lock-in. We also get an opportunity for a PhysX and physics GPU history lesson.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\nGrab a PC building Modmat! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\nAnd check out or high heat resistant silicone project and soldering mat! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-project-soldering-mat\nOr gra",
