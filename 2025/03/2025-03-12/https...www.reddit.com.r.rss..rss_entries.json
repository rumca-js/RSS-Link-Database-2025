I also tried NetNewsWire for a while, which was nice but lacked many customization options.</p> <p>Recently, I&#39;ve been reading about Feedbin and Fiery Feeds and want to try them, but I&#39;m not sure how they actually perform. Though they both offer trial periods, I&#39;d like to hear your opinions first. My questions are:</p> <ol> <li>Is it strange to use both of these apps together? I understand Feedbin is an RSS service while Fiery Feeds is a client (although Feedbin also has its own client).</li> <li>Is choosing just one of them sufficient?</li> <li>Are there advantages to using them together?</li> </ol> <p>I would appreciate hearing from those with actual experience using these tools.
