On March 1st, all my accounts linked to Facebook and Instagram were suspended because my main profile allegedly doesn\u2019t comply with the guidelines. They\u2019re asking me to file an appeal from that profile. Unfortunately, the profile that Instagram considers to be <em>my</em> main account isn\u2019t actually mine, so I have no way to access it or file an appeal.</p> <p>On top of that, Instagram\u2019s customer service is non-existent. I\u2019ve tried every way possible to reach out, but all I get are automatic responses from bots. I know it might sound trivial, but I had started building a small business through this account, and after two years of hard work, it was finally gaining traction. Now I\u2019ve lost everything, someone knows how I can talk with a real person in IG customer service ? </p> <p>If anyone can help me, please reach out. I\u2019d be incredibly grateful. \u2764\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",
