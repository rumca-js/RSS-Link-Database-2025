The game is currently locked at 30 FPS, and after decoding all the game files with APK Editor Pro, I even checked the android/data folder but couldn\u2019t find anything that looks like it controls the frame rate limit. Has anyone managed to remove this cap or found the right file/setting to tweak? Any help or pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IM_WIZ_FIRE\"> /u/IM_WIZ_FIRE </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1j9tb10/removing_the_30_fps_cap_in_poppy_playtime_ch3_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1j9tb10/removing_the_30_fps_cap_in_poppy_playtime_ch3_on/\">[comments]</a></span>",
