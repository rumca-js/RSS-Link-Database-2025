If you\u2019re working on a Raspberry Pi project and need a <strong>better way to power it</strong>, I\u2019m here to help \u2013 for free. I\u2019ll design a custom DC-DC converter board or module for your project; you only pay for the parts (no charge for my design time). Maybe you want to run your Pi off a battery or solar panel and need a stable 5V, or perhaps your project uses a Pi plus other hardware that require different voltages. I can design a solution that takes an input (up to 50V, so plenty of headroom for common sources like 12V batteries or adapters) and steps it down to 5V for the Pi (and 3.3V or other rails for peripherals if needed). I\u2019ll include all the good stuff like voltage regulation (to handle when your motors rev or your battery sags) and protection circuits so your Pi stays safe. I can also build in extras like a USB-C input or even a <strong>USB interface to the Pi</strong> itself so the Pi can monitor its own power (for example,",
