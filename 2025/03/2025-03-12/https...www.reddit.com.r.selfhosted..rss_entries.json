I could have bought a subscription, sure. I didn&#39;t want to. That&#39;s not how we do things here. After much research, Ring-MQTT and Eclipse Mosquito, an MQTT Broker, seemed the best solution. There are many tutorials on getting that setup with HA (HomeAssistant) in OS or Supervised mode, but I wanted to use Docker.</p> <p>It took some fiddling, but I got it all set up.

Instead of juggling a bunch of components like document loaders, text splitters, and vector databases, <strong>rlama</strong> streamlines everything into one neat CLI tool. Here\u2019s the rundown:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Document Ingestion &amp; Chunking:</strong> It efficiently breaks down your documents.</li> <li><strong>Local Embedding Generation:</strong> Uses local models via Ollama.</li> <li><strong>Hybrid Vector Storage:</strong> Supports both semantic and textual queries.</li> <li><strong>Querying:</strong> Quickly retrieves context to generate accurate, fact-based answers.</li> </ul> <p>This local-first approach means you get better privacy, speed, and ease of management.
