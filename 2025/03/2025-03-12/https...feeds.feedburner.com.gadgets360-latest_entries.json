        "description": "Recent research challenges traditional views on planetary-mass objects, suggesting they may form through violent interactions between young star systems rather than standard planetary or stellar processes. Simulations indicate these clashes create dense gas filaments that evolve into free-floating objects, often in binary pairs. This discovery explains the abundance of such objects in star clusters like Orion and raises the possibility of a third cosmic classification beyond planets and stars.",

This theory suggests that lightweight, self-annihilating dark matter particles could be producing electrons and positrons, influencing cosmic chemistry. The findings challenge conventional views, offering a new way to detect dark matter beyond its gravitational effects. Upcoming space missions, like NASA\u2019s COSI telescope, may provide evidence to support this groundbreaking hypothesis.",
