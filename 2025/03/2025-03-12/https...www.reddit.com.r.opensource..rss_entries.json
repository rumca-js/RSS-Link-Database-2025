The lack of labeled data kinda prohibits it, hence the idea of the tool.</p> <p>How GenIText works:</p> <p>You can install GenIText via pip install.

Opening nextcloud, I get the warning that something is wrong with the type of characters (utf8 stuff). &quot;MySQL is used as database but does not support 4-byte characters. [...]&quot;. So developers forgot to change the schema.<br/> Most of the Apps are not fully working, even those supported by nextcloud like &quot;Recognize&quot;, clicking enable gives an instant error. Even on a fresh installation. And there is no design philosophy, every app looks different. </p> <p>But all this is acceptable, since I use nextcloud only to sync files anyway. The native apps for Linux and Android are complete garbage. The Android app clearly does not do its job (auto-update doesn&#39;t do anything, and I tried literally everything). And the Linux app is weird, ",
