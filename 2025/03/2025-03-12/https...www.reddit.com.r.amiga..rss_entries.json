Ideally, I\u2019d like a setup that I can also boot from a USB stick to turn any PC into a temporary Amiga system.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard of WinUAE and FS-UAE but have set them up before. Are there any pre-configured images or distributions that would make this process simple? Bonus points if there\u2019s a way to get it running without too much manual configuration! what about retroarch or launchbox ? others. I want to setup my own on either desktop or laptop. </p> <p>Would appreciate any recommendations, guides, or personal experiences.
