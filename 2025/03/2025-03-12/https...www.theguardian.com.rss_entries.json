Benfica are winning 4-0 and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are in utter disarray. Zeki Amdouni runs the ball into an entirely unpatrolled Atl\u00e9tico area, gets a free shot from 14 yards and misses a glorious chance to make it 5-0. Nobody cares. Least of all Liverpool, even though this miss will effectively end up, five months later, knocking them out of the Champions League.</p><p>Of course, we\u2019re in the realm of the absurd here, although when it comes to the new Champions League format this is a system with margins exactly, and absurdly, this fine. By virtue of this one goal not scored \u2013 and of course you could pick out many others \u2013 Benfica end up finishing 16th in the 36-team group phase rather than 15th: a position from which they, rather than Paris Saint-Germain, would probably have ended up facing Liverpool in the round of 16.</p",

Would Paris Saint-Germain be able to play as well again? Was there any chance Liverpool could be as bad? After Alisson\u2019s heroics in the French capital, would he again be called upon to singlehandedly repel PSG\u2019s attacking hordes? And while it\u2019s OK for PSG fans to finally like Luis Enrique\u2019s exciting team of apparently ego-free young whippersnappers, is it OK for neutrals who disapprove of nation states buying up football clubs in blatant attempts at image-laundering to row in behind them as well?
