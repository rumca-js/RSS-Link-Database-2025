Everything was going great, never getting errors with secure rips. Now, a few months ago I started getting errors on multiple tracks per CD. I thought it might be my drive, so I bought a USB drive to rip, same errors. These are brand new and are coming with errors. I know some errors can be due to manufacture defects, but wouldn&#39;t that be for all of that one CD? I have two of the same CD, and it gives errors on different tracks. Even tracks that have ripped 100% error free before are now randomly getting errors. Am I all of a sudden doing something wrong? I use dbpoweramp. I&#39;ve even tried EAC and it will give errors, but on different tracks than what dbpoweramp did. I&#39;m so confused.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BadBloodMO\"> /u/BadBloodMO </a> <b",

It&#39;s a small medical practice with 3 client machines that operate mostly 9-5. The server stays online 24/7 to do backups and for the business owners to remote in after hours for administration duties. In total, the accumulated data is about 800GB, and that&#39;s after 15 years of the business operating.</p> <p>Ideally I&#39;m after a drive that&#39;s super reliable and has the ability to report possible health issues. Noise isn&#39;t a problem.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen online that the Seagate Exos and WD IronWolf are good contenders. I&#39;m just wondering what everyone&#39;s thoughts are on these drives OR if there is something else they recommend. If I&#39;ve missed anything that will help better the recommendation please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sydjager",
