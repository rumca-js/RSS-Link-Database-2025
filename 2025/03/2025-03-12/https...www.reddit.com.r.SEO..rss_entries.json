        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all! I&#39;ve been wanting to expand my SEO expertise to include more things like backlinks and technical SEO, as I&#39;ve mostly been creating content strategies, doing KW &amp; competitor research, writing articles, etc. for the past year. I want to work at a digital marketing or SEO agency, but I feel I need a bit more knowledge. </p> <p>What are some good courses to take or sites to look at to expand my SEO knowledge? Do I need to take courses, or should I just reach out to SEO agencies with my content marketing knowledge and say I&#39;m willing to learn? Would they accept someone who&#39;s come from more of a content writing background?</p> <p>I do know that this is a pretty vague question, so I&#39;m happy to give some more info if needed!
