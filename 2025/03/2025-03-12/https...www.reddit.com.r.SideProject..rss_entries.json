Instead of juggling a bunch of components like document loaders, text splitters, and vector databases, <strong>rlama</strong> streamlines everything into one neat CLI tool. Here\u2019s the rundown:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Document Ingestion &amp; Chunking:</strong> It efficiently breaks down your documents.</li> <li><strong>Local Embedding Generation:</strong> Uses local models via Ollama.</li> <li><strong>Hybrid Vector Storage:</strong> Supports both semantic and textual queries.</li> <li><strong>Querying:</strong> Quickly retrieves context to generate accurate, fact-based answers.</li> </ul> <p>This local-first approach means you get better privacy, speed, and ease of management.

Strangely enough, I have always appreciated the description of a Sagittarius. It has always resonated with me, and so a lingering consideration always lurked.</p> <p>I used an astronomy API to chart the planets, display the solar system in a ThreeJS visualization, and inspired by Hades 2, I gave an OpenAI Assistant life in the form of <strong>Hecate</strong> -- witch goddess of astrology and occult. I rendered her as a sprite with PixiJS, and she drives the chat in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; format.</p> <p>This was some of the silliest fun I&#39;ve had in a while. Please, come check it out! </p> <p><a href=\"https://hecatestars.com/\">https://hecatestars.com/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",

I have a few pet peeves, but the biggest one is probably when I see how much service fees I have to pay when I use Rover to look after my cats, or TaskRabbit to book a helper, or AirBnB when I book a vacation spot. Now, my irritation is of course NOT aimed towards the people doing the jobs or owning the house - in fact I get annoyed on their behalf when I see how much they are losing out to the platforms. </p> <p>So, my mission is to build a platform that DOES NOT do that. Here is what I have so far - I&#39;m not a coder, so I am using <a href=\"http://Bubble.io\">Bubble.io</a> to build it - I&#39;d appreciate your inputs:</p> <p><a href=\"https://matescreate.bubbleapps.io/version-test\">https://matescreate.bubbleapps.io/version-test</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Academic_Tank_8361\"> /u/Ac",
