One of my favourite parts of the book is how a lot of the text is Hadrian&#39;s thoughts, musings and feelings. There&#39;s just something about a character rambling and monologuing on and on about the way they feel about certain things that I absolutely cannot get enough of. This particular itch has been scratched, surprisingly, by a lot of self-insert fanfiction and isekai webnovels. A lot of the other books in first person that I have read like Red Rising, The Will Of The Many and even the Farseer trilogy and Kingkiller don&#39;t have enough of this in my opinion so I would love to get your recommendations for books where the narrator protagonist really lays down all their thoughts and philosophical musings.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/provegana69\"> /u/provegana69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanta",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello fellow fantasy fans, last night I started a new novel, The Way of Renegades by Steve D Wall. I recently purchased the audiobook during one of Audible&#39;s most recent sales solely based on the reason that it is narrated by Steven Pacey, who is famously known in this subreddt for his exquisite narration of Joe Abercrombie&#39;s First Law series. </p> <p>So far I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying the story and I wanted to make more fantasy fans aware of the series. I also discovered last night that the author is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of the second audiobook. I haven&#39;t seen too online discussing the book and I wanted to give some time to recommend an excellent indie author! Please check out his Kickstarter if you&#39;re interested. It would be amazing to hear another book narrated by Steve Pacey!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stevedwall/the-sound-of-change?fbclid=IwY2xjawI-1CJleHRuA2FlbQ",

Another one could be like Alex Verus series with the shadow realm where is way more magical and amazing on the inside.</p> <p>Just looking if histories like this exist and what advantages they do with it? How the author and MC revolves around it.</p> <p>imagine having a sentient house and it moves around the world and is way more powerfull! sounds dope for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vast-B",

I am really not far in, but I have to say I am really disappointed with it at this point. The writing style feels really amateur and really makes it hard for me to feel immersed, and I feel as if there is no intrigue to any of the characters or the world so far, and it just feels as if it&#39;s going towards a very cliche narrative. It doesn&#39;t help that I am not very impressed with the narration and find it difficult to follow the dialogue at points, but maybe I am currently still too used to Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, as I always find it weird to readjust to a new narrator at first.</p> <p>I did nearly DNF The Way of Kings at one point because it felt very sl",

I bounced off the humor HARD once before but decided to give it another go as an audiobook. The narrator lends the perfect cheesy-ness to take off some of the edge. I liked that cat (which should surprise no one who can read my username), I thought Carl periodically cutting through the zaniness to remind the reader how fucked up the situation is was a good move, and in general the character work was interesting. </p> <p>Most anything outside the character work was alright. I found the constant system talk went from interesting to way over-done by the end of the book. It felt like the pacing was all over the place, especially after they descended to the 2nd floor. And there was a lot of deus ex machina, which I know is in keeping with the game being manipulated but even so it felt heavy handed on top of being heavy handed.</p> <p>Despite ",

Really enjoyed them even if I lost a bit of steam towards the end. I got the recent release, the Dark Mirror, this week and I realised I remember barely anything about the previous book, the Mask Falling. Can anyone recommend a good recap video/article for the Mask Falling or the series as a whole - I don&#39;t really have time/patience to reread a whole book and I&#39;m sure a few basic recap points will jog my memory.
