I have. So let\u2019s talk about movie theater etiquette.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, I went to the Academy Museum in Los Angeles for a screening of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20929735/best-movies-of-the-decade-2010s\">Arrival</a></em>. (Great movie!) But even before it even started \u2014 there weren\u2019t any commercials, since this was a museum; we were just sitting in a theater with all the lights still on \u2014 the guy in front of me turned around and passive-aggressively said, \u201cWow, I can hear everything you\u2019re saying!\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cut to",

The entire playthrough took just a few minutes; I was escorted to Miss Mulligatawney\u2019s office, dressed down, and booted out. This was just my first attempt, and I soon found myself starting the events of the morning over and over again, completely invested in discovering the secrets of the school, my fellow students, and the events of the murder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Expelled! </",
