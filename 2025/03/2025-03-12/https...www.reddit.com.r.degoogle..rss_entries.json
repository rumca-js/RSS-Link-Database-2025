I really hate how Google farms me for data and I don&#39;t like it when social media does it either</p> <p>But I&#39;m curious if there is an app that can be side loaded for say, Instagram, that will allow me much more control and customization over the app. Such as completely doing away with the for you page and the algorithmic content and only be shown content I want to see from people I directly follow. Something like new pipe but for Instagram. To be clear I&#39;m not exactly looking for an Instagram alternative. I&#39;m kinda looking for something that overlays it so I can have more control.

I created a proton mail acct and now I have my gmail forward to my proton mail. Is this an issue from a security standpoint? I tried to have the gmail forward to an alias, but that wasn\u2019t working. So I just set up mail forwarding through the desktop proton mail app. Given everything going on in the US I\u2019m a bit touchy about the security of my email (since now saying bad things about car companies is apparently illegal) and want to make sure i\u2019m not spreading the doodoo over to my proton mail account. </p> <p>Over time I want to change logins, update contacts, etc., but it is a massive undertaking considering it\u2019s been my main email acct professionally and personally for years. My work also uses G suite, gmail, and google drive to manage our email and documents. I also have a yahoo mail acct, but not sure how to handle that one because it\u2019s mostly spam. </p> </div><!-- ",
