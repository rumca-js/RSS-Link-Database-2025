I&#39;ve been looking into replacing Google Photos with Immich and if I understand the recommended way of using Docker to host Immich right, I would have to host a server myself. So of course I could install everything over my normal pc, link that to Filen, my cloud storage provider (which is possible appearently, or so I&#39;ve read). But even then, Immich would stop working if I turned my pc off, right?</p> <p>But there is the possibility of letting Filen run as a WebDAV-Server. So my question is, is there a way to use that to run Immich without having to host a server myself? I tried looking it up but haven&#39;t really gotten anywhere.
