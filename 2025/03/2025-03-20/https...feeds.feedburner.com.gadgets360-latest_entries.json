According to a new genetic study, these reptiles floated on rafts of vegetation, possibly due to extreme weather events. The research, published in PNAS, found that Fiji\u2019s iguanas are closely related to North American species, contradicting earlier theories. Their resistance to dehydration and starvation may have helped them survive. The study aligns their arrival with the islands\u2019 formation, shedding light on one of the longest transoceanic migrations by a land species.",
