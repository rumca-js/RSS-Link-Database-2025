        "description": "In this snippet from Podcast Beyond 888, It\u2019s been in the works for years, and delayed by several months, but Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is finally here, and it\u2019s worth the wait. Y\u2019know, assuming you like big huge open-world games, don\u2019t mind when Assassin\u2019s Creed games veer into RPG territory, and are interested in the feudal Japanese setting. Now, the big question: what does this mean for 2025\u2019s OTHER big huge open-world samurai game, Ghost of Yotei? Will it be a samurai showdown, or will a rising tide raise all ships? Either way, anyone who likes running around killing dudes with a katana and shuriken is eating good this year.\n\nCheck out the full episode of Podcast Beyond here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUOsK0ZNis\n\nThis week\u2019s show is Max Scoville, Jada Griffin, Mark Medina, Brian Altano, and is produced by Nick Maillet\n\nBeyond! is a part of Geek Media Podcast Network, an IGN Entertainment Brand.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
