I loved all those series and it depends on what mood i\u2019m in to which writing style I actually prefer. However, besides the books I\u2019ve just named I don\u2019t really know many other fantasy series with prose on that level.

I love the moments featuring the underground goblin society in Tolkien&#39;s <em>Hobbit</em>, and I would later read the Warhammer Fantasy and Age of Sigmar novels <em>Skarsnik</em> (by Guy Haley) <em>Gloomspite</em>, and <em>Bad Loon Rising</em> (both by Andy Clark), which all (except Gloomspite) feature goblins as the main protagonist. Finally, I recently began playing the somewhat obscure games <em>Styx: Master of Shadows</em> and <em>Shards of Darkness</em> both of which feature the titular goblin character Styx as the player character. </p> <p>Is there any other Fantasy (mainly looking for books, but I&#39;m fine with other suggested media) that features a goblin as the main protagonist?

The prose is beautiful, but it\u2019s just SO dry. It very much feels like I\u2019m reading the Bible in a way (or like I\u2019m reading the summary of a good story instead of the story itself). There is just such a huge detachment in the writing\u2014from the characters, the events, everything\u2026 It\u2019s hard for me to feel a connection to anyone or anything when it reads so impersonal.</p> <p>Does anyone else have the same issues as me? (I\u2019m sure I\u2019m in the minority here, but that\u2019s okay)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oddyseus144\"> /u/Oddyseus144 </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

It gave me the feeling of an alternate reality where fae exist or were forgotten over time. I loved the academic feel of it with her field notes and research. I would love to read a book that basically rewrites history in a way that doesn\u2019t seem completely unbelievable. Something set in our world but with hidden secrets that most wouldn\u2019t know about unless they really looked for it. Preferably not something set in a complete fantasy world, sort of like the Harry Potter books? I also really liked A Study in Drowning. Some romance is fine but no detailed/graphic scenes please. Fade to black type of scenes are fine. I do not need descriptions. I\u2019ve had such a hard time finding something similar to the Emily Wilde series, currently just read",
