But the studio has grown a lot lately, becoming a team juggling several projects simultaneously. Alongside the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-1-and-2-remakes/\">Max Payne remakes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/control-2/\">Control 2</a>, Remedy is also trying something very different from its past games. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/\">FBC Firebreak</a> is a three-player co-op PvE first-person shooter set in The Oldest House, the setting for Control. I recently got to see a hands-off preview of the game, which strives to combine the team's signature strangeness with the pick-up-and-play appeal of a modern multiplayer shooter. But its best feat may be what it <em>doesn't </em>want to be: your part-time job.</p><p dir=\"lt",

Combat is best avoided, as just one or two undead monsters can kill playable characters, especially if they're already injured, sick, or tired.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/444",
