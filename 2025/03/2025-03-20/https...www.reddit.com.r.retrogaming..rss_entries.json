However, I mainly play on my 36&quot; CRT TV, and have an HDMI-&gt;Composite(sp) for use in that if I&#39;m not just using regular S-Video.</p> <p>Would something like <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/evga-141-u1-cb20-lr-usb-3-0-type-c/p/N82E16815101014?nrtv_cid=07dq9cy7bhau0\">this EVGA capture card</a> work for my purposes?

There are lists of the best game for every year and so forth but I thought I&#39;d get some more opinions to go with it and add variety to the list. So please leave your suggestions and me and my family will enjoy the throwback at some point.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nagol567\"> /u/Nagol567 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jfeurh/retro_gaming_gauntlet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jfeurh/retro_gaming_gauntlet/\">[comments]",

Ntm all the Japanese exclusives. I also in general play home consoles more than handheld </p> <p>But that brings me to the Neo geo pocket color, I kinda really want to get into handheld gaming and while I can\u2019t done as much reasech I\u2019ve found interesting stuff like the sonic game, some of the arcade ports and stuff. And honestly just the console alone intrigues me. I really want a Camo blue one because it\u2019ll match my favorite pair of blue camo pants and I think that would be so sick in a Gameboy micro commercial kinda way.</p> <p>So please, enlighten me to your experiences with said consoles and your opinions on each and which you\u2019d recommend. And anything else related to them, I\u2019m just interested to find out more on peo",

And I don&#39;t like the way games are today. Introductions aside.</p> <p>Lately, I&#39;ve been wanting to play Mario Party 2 with other people, for example, but I&#39;m not very good at socializing. Does anyone have any advice on how to find people to play retro games with? I already tried Fightcade. But its game range is mostly fighting games and arcades.
