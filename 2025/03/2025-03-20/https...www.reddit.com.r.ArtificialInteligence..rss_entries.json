AI isn\u2019t just generating content anymore, it\u2019s messing with what people like in the first place. It\u2019s gone from making images and text to creating experiences that are built around what someone wants most. But at what point is it not just giving people what they already like, but steering them toward something new? If AI keeps showing someone the same type of thing over and over, does that start shaping their taste? Are we actually seeing human imagination without limits, or is this technology quietly changing the way people think without them realizing? And what happens when the things AI creates become more interesting than reality? Do people start choosing them instead? If someone can have a world made exactly for them, what happens to real life? This is all moving fast, and does anyone really know where it\u2019s headed? I feel like I\u2019m going crazy thinking about it. Does this bother anyone else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

These major tech companies all bend a knee to Trump and yet we all are just kind of accepting and utilizing their AI that could very easily be turned against us? It seems short sighted. These are systems that are able to rake huge swathes of the internet for data in instants and that we willfully give personal information too, the ease with which these things could be turned into a massive automated system of oppression is obvious and yet it seems very few people have this worry?
