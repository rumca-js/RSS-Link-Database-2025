The appimage doesn&#39;t help, however running the windows version through wine does work but then I miss out on controller support. Has this happened to anyone else?</p> <p>And to preemptively answer this question, Do I want to use Retroarch? Not really. But if push comes to shove I don&#39;t mind just using it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/S1rTerra\"> /u/S1rTerra </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jfv6cb/does_mesen_not_render_any_graphics_for_anyone_else/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jfv6cb/does_mesen_not_render_any_graphi",

Basically, my GPU is ALWAYS at 100% (even in menus) (RX 7700 XT). Some would say - cool, game uses it all. Wrong, Fps often drops to ~20 when fights happen. </p> <p>I tested on Windows with same settings - I can maintain rock solid 60 fps, while GPU usage is at ~ 60 - 70%. </p> <p>This must be some kind of bug? I did test dx 11, too, with no luck. I used proton experimental, proton 9, proton ge 9.26, same issue.</p> <p>I use Ubuntu 24.10, with latest kernel installed via mainline, as well as latest Mesa 25.0 And other games do run fine, it&#39;s just Helldivers that has this weird issue. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/R2D2irl\"> /u/R2D2irl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jfv55f/helldivers_2_issues/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

However, I have the problem that some games crash with older Nvidia drivers, some games crash with newer drivers, and I cannot fix this by switching around with WINE runtimes, it really needs the drivers.</p> <p>Now if I have a &quot;known good&quot; combination of kernel and drivers, can I somehow keep that on the boot menu? Currently I have older kernels on the boot menu, but they immediately start compiling the latest nvidia driver version when I select them, which sometimes works, sometimes doesnt (because some drivers need 5.13+). Any way the end result is my game does not work.</p> <p>So I would like to use latest kernel+latest driver by default, but be able to switch back to older kernel AND older driver in boot menu. Is there any boot option etc. that would accomplish this?</p> <p>Thank you for your help...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
