So well I&#39;m really needing somewhere to listen to music, Spotify free it&#39;s really not an option for the infinite ads and no skipping option. I thought maybe I could subscribe but it&#39;s really too expensive for me. I tried SoundCloud, it was fine, but when I search artists, almost all of them say &quot;not available in your country&quot; no matter if I use VPN and where I use it, so I can barely listen anything there. I don&#39;t know much about the topic so I&#39;d need someone to tell me which streaming apps could I use that are free (or at least way cheaper), preferably not ads or maybe not so annoying ones (SoundCloud few times had but were only images, not audio like Spotify), and that I can access to the artists which is the main point of listening to music. I don&#39;t have problem if I have to up",

I did a little reading on this from another user posted two years ago, but I didn&#39;t find the answer I needed. Basically... how can I get my full length disc movie/show episodes onto an external drive with Windows 11 laptop, capture card, splitter, PS4 and non-smart TV?
