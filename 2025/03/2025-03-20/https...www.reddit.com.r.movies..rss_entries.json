Also love science and it&#39;s nostalgic to check out time periods when I grew up. Gen X has a very unique perspective like no others because we&#39;ve seen pre-internet, start of it, and our current technology. It&#39;s truly amazing and so interesting but it would be even more amazing if stuff like (in this movie) really happened. I cry like crazy at the end...like I just close my eyes and picture that reunion with my own father. Anyways, I&#39;d like to hear about anyone else&#39;s reviews on the movie.

Not to sound ridiculous but I have a dog that looks very much like a small bear, and I think I&#39;m projecting hard onto my precious baby pup lol</p> <p>The movie even gave Buchanan a cute ending, where we see that what he really wanted was to perform again and be appreciated.
