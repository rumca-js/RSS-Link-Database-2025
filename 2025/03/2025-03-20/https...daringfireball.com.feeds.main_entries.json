With explicit user permission\u2009\u2014\u2009that\ncan be revoked at any time\u2009\u2014\u2009third party apps can both read from\nand write to your Health data. Apple does a lot of that itself,\nboth through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related\nthings an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are\nwelcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nobody is suggesting Apple should give up on AI. Quite the opposite. They really need to go from being <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it\">a joke</a> to being good at it, fast.
