It's likely that an advanced civilization might need so much power that they enclose their host star in solar energy-collecting satellites. These Dyson swarms will trap heat so any planets within the sphere are likely to experience a temperature increase. A new paper explores this and concludes that a complete Dyson swarm outside the orbit of Earth would raise our temperature by 140 K.",
