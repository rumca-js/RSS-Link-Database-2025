That was my reality a few years ago. \nThis unit, built with Linux, C++, and QT, was designed to be a reliable middleman, handling RF frames from a multitude of endpoints.\nBut it was a bit of a wildcard - unexplained resets, occasional data loss, and all. \nIt was supposed to support 7500 endpoints, but once we hit 5000, it started to show signs of strain.\n\nThe software was a tough nut to crack - maintaining it was a challenge and it wasn't exactly a developer's favorite. \nBut here's where the plot thickens: after two years of relentless work, we transformed this underdog into a champion. \nThe unit now supports 10,000 endpoints, with zero resets or data loss.\n\nIntrigued? Join me as I unravel the journey of this remarkable turnaround. \nLet's dive into the world ",
