It protects people from being &#39;doxxed&#39;, from being stalked, harassed, and having their work, which can be controversial, tarnish their name (e.g. in Google searches). It lowers the personal risk and in this sense allows more contributions. It&#39;s a free work contribution with zero downside or responsibility.</p> <p>But anonymity is also a major problem. We are trusting strangers and have no ability to verify their credentials, their background, and when removed from a community they can rejoin with a different name. It&#39;s also hard to collaborate with people who are completely unreachable, i.e. no email, no website, have GitHub issues turned off, and so on. It&#39;s also often unclear who is responsible for some code, i.e. who to reach out to. The free work is great, but it becomes worthless and overburdened with risk and complexity.</p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts?</",
