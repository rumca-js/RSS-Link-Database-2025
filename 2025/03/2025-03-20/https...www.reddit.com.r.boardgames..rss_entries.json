He had nine victory points (i had 7) with 10 required to win. And I pinned all of his rifleman with only one of my rifleman left. The mission condition for winning is 10 victory points, however pinning an enemy constitutes a win right? However he had three machine gun squads sitting on the board as well so if my last rifleman was to keep playing, he would likely be picked off and killed if I didn\u2019t kill his machine gun squads first. So as far as I can see I win because I pinned the enemy With more victory points but not the winning 10. But logic would say that he wins because there\u2019s a very slim chance I could control more points\u2026 anyone want to chime in on this one?
