It had a white cover with either green or orange coloured title, and was about a girl struggling with addiction to drugs and eventually she got clean and I think it was because someone overdosed (or she was pregnant? I can\u2019t remember as ten years is a long time lmao) but I cannot for the life of me remember what the title of the book is, so I was wondering if anyone knew it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DullDivide7451\"> /u/DullDivide7451 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jfcqz7/please_help_me_find_this_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jfcqz7/please_help_me_find_this_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",
