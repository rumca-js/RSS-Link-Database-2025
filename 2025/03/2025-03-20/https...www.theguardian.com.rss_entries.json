Certainly, having got to know affable, driven, sweet-tempered Joel personally in this intimate portrait, it\u2019s a natural desire to want to see even more of his extraordinary work: 60 years of photographs encompassing street photography, official documentation of the 9/11 disaster site in New York, still lifes and more.</p><p>At the same time, it\u2019s also entirely apt that this feature isn\u2019t just an adjunct to Meyerowitz\u2019s career, given it is so profoundly about Joel and Maggie\u2019s marriage, a kind of passionate truce (as its",

Many readers pointed out in the comments that in fact she was imprisoned and executed. May the quiz gently draw your attention to the rules about there being no need to factcheck obvious jokes. It is quite clear that Lady Jane Grey did not embark on such a venture. For a start, unlike Liz Truss, she did not write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/19/five-year-old-on-acid-liz-truss-ten-years-to-save-the-west-digested-by-john-crace\">a hubristic book arguing she had been right all along</a>, or issue legal threats to the powers that be <a hre",
