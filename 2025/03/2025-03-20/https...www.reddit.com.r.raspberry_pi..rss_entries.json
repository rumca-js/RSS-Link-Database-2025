I am accessing the Pi via VNC. However, I&#39;ve had it multiple times now that after a while the access is not possible anymore and I have to unplug and restart the Pi to be able to connect again. </p> <p>There&#39;s a Telegram bot running on it that reliably detects network outages and sends a message once it&#39;s back online. It does not detect any outages during these times. At the same time this bot is able to respond to certain commands via telegram but goes silent at the same time the VNC isn&#39;t working anymore. Hence, it seems like the whole Pi has an issue. </p> <p>I have tried to look into the journalctl but didn&#39;t find anything suspicious.

I&#39;m pretty sure the zero 2w I have doesnt have wifi, nor do I know how to get it to connect to it, and it doesn&#39;t have a USB port, just micro USB, micro hdmi, and micro sd. </p> <p>What do I do to add the roms?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kattasaurus-Rex\"> /u/Kattasaurus-Rex </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jfctd7/i_need_help_adding_roms_to_zero_2w/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jfctd7/i_need_help_adding_roms_to_zero_2w/\">[comments]</a></span>",
