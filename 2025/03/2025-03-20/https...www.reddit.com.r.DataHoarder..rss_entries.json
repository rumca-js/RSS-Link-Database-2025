So, recently I was taking apart my old laptop and its internal HDD is now my external drive, but I am scared for the files I put on there because it&#39;s HDD, and if it falls it could theoretically break. So, I want to backup the data from my new external drive to my PC every time I connect it to my home PC. Is there a way to do that automatically cuz doing it manually is a pain in the ass as I am working with lots of files every day on different PCs?</p> <p>Sorry for my bad English, I&#39;m just learning.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/radam_official\"> /u/radam_official </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jg2w05/backing_up_files_from_drive_to_drive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jg2w05/backing_up_files_from_drive_to_drive/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Thanks everyone who has replied so far, genuinely. I&#39;m hoping I can find an old, incomplete backup I made years ago on my old laptop, as I&#39;m a bit strapped for cash right now. Wish me luck and thanks again!</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to recover data from an old external hard drive (WD MyPassport 0740) and I contacted a place that had some good reviews, SalvageData. The guy told me that after a free evaluation the recovery could cost anywhere from at least 500 to 2800 usd, but is that the cheapest solution? Could an IT person from OfficeDepot or somewhere similar help me just as well for cheaper? It&#39;s definitely less than 1 or 2 TB of photos, videos, and miscellaneous files, and I&#39;ve bought brand new external drives for way less, so is that just the normal cost of labor for these things? Any help is appreciated!</p> <",

I have a spare mini pc n100 that I would like to use to replace the current server.</p> <p>I have done some searching and found 2 possible solutions.</p> <ol> <li>Use a m.2 board that have 5 attachment for SATA drives. The miniPC have 2 m.2 slots. The drives will be housed in a dumb HDD slot that I need to attach ATX power. Some mod required to do this. Maybe reuse my existing desktop case that can retrofit 10+ hdds.</li> <li>Use a USB storage housing for the HDDs. Probably need to get 2 units of 4 bay USB docking station. Wondering if it&#39;s good idea to run 4 drives on 1 USB connection to the miniPC. There will be bottleneck for sure but I don&#39;t need the speed. It&#39;s mostly for data storage for movies.</li> </ol> <p>The current server is running on Ubuntu 22.04. Applications in there are Snapraid (for data redundancy), CCTV recording (1 cam only), Nextclou",
