Our bosses are now telling us that all new development is to be done in Java. I\u2019m a scrum master, so not developer (sorry). So.. Are our bosses idiots or is it possible - and maybe even recommended - to have a base written in both scala and Java? I\u2019m kind of hoping for \u00abyour bosses are idiots\u00bb, but I could easily be the biggest idiot here. \ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jumpy_Rise8462\"> /u/Jumpy_Rise8462 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jfxq5c/are_our_bosses_idiots_or_can_it_be_done_scala_vs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jfxq5c/are_our_bosses_idiots_or_can_it_be_done_scala_vs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;ve been following <a href=\"/r/developer\">r/developer</a> for a while to get ideas on how to improve my mindset and stay true to my goals. Over the past few months, I&#39;ve been working on an app called <strong>LifeCoach+</strong>, which basically helps you reflect on your core values and track how your daily actions align with them.</p> <p>I&#39;m the developer, so this is a bit of a personal project. My aim was to create something that prompts you to dig deeper into what really matters to you\u2014like your priorities, long-term goals, and even small daily habits. For me, it&#39;s been a huge help in staying grounded and making decisions that actually feel meaningful.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;d love some <strong>honest feedback</strong> from the community: - Is the interface easy to use? - Do the reflection prompts actually help you think about your values more deeply? - What features or improvements would you like to see?</p> <p><a href=\"h",
