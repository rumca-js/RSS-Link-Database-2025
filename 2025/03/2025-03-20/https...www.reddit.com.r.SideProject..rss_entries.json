I\u2019m looking to create a course and start selling it because online courses are one of the most profitable side hustles out there. But honestly, I\u2019m overwhelmed by all the steps: creating the course itself, picking platforms and tools, building a landing page, marketing it, etc. For those who\u2019ve done it, what\u2019s the simplest, most straightforward way to get started? Any tips on choosing a platform (like Teachable, Gumroad, etc.), creating an effective landing page, or keeping the process manageable? How do you handle pricing and promotion without overcomplicating things? I\u2019d love to hear your advice or personal experiences to help me cut through the noise and get going.
