From what I&#39;ve read, Meta Quest 3 seems to be the preferred choice. Games I&#39;ve played most consistently over the years would be PUBG, FIFA, Destiny, R6 Siege, and Rock Band. </p> <p>Typically I&#39;d be very competitive in these games but I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;m simply too slow to really climb ranked ladders anymore (also have 2 young kids) so I&#39;m fine with playing at a more casual pace now (for example: casuals mode in PUBG)</p> <p>MQ3 seems to have some shooters, adventure, and even interactive board games (really cool if so). The fitness games would also be appealing to keep me moving.</p> <p>Based on the interests I have, I&#39;m trying to gauge if others who may be similar to me, have made this investment and get that level of satisfaction only great gaming experiences can provide.</p> <p>Any advice is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",

What would u suggest? I prefer DLSS as it really gives an overall better experience to my eyes, but im fine with fsr too i guess, also the lower wattage is an important thing, as my 4070 barely consumes some.
