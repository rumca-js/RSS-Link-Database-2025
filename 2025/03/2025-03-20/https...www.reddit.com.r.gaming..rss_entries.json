Good game overall but yet another game where the dialogue feels quite bad at times and you feel that immersivebreaking sillyness and, yeah, videogamey laziness. Like when someone speaks and suddenly stops midsentence because someone&#39;s about to interject, and it goes way too long before the other starts to speak. Like they recorded their lines completely separated from eachother (probably did) and then the editing screwed up. I felt it became better later on and in camp it felt really good. I felt it was a bit uneven I suppose.</p> <p>With that fresh in mind I started playing Dragon age 2 on Series X a couple days ago. Runs great with 60fps boost and resolution boost. I missed it back in the days on the 360 so this is some nice retrogaming to me.</p> <p>Anyways. I found the game boring in the beginning tbh but it kept getting better and now I like it. Anyways again...One thing that hit me was just how good the dialogu",
