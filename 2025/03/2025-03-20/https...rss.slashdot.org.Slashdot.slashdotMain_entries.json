Under the settlement, HP admits no wrongdoing and won't pay monetary damages to affected customers, though it will pay $5,000 each to the three plaintiffs and $725,000 in attorneys' fees. \n\nHP has agreed to allow users of specific printer models impacted by the November 2020 update to decline firmware updates containing \"Dynamic Security\" features -- HP's term for technology that blocks cartridges using non-HP chips.

The poor subsidize the rich through two mechanisms: swipe fees that drive up retail prices by $1,700 annually for the average family, and late fees and interest charges that finance rewards programs. Interest revenue for credit-card companies has ballooned from $76 billion in 2020 to $170 billion in 2024. \n\nThe economy now appears to be slowing down.

        "description": "OpenAI has launched a more powerful version of its o1 \"reasoning\" AI model, o1-pro, in its developer API. From a report: According to OpenAI, o1-pro uses more computing than o1 to provide \"consistently better responses.\" Currently, it's only available to select developers -- those who've spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services -- and it's pricey. Very pricey. OpenAI is charging $150 per million tokens (~750,000 words) fed into the model and $600 per million tokens generated by the model. That's twice the price of OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10x the price of regular.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI's+o1-pro+is+the+Company's+Most+Expensive+AI+Model+Yet%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F03%2F20%2F0227246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%",

In a statement given to the outlet, LG confirmed the claim but clarified that it will still continue long-term XR research and development. \n\nAccording to The Bell, LG took the decision because it believes the XR market isn't growing as quickly as it expected, and it wants to focus more on heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) and robotics.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=LG+Ceases+XR+Product+Efforts%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F03%2F20%2F006216%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.face",
