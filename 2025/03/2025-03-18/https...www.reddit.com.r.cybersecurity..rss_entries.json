If you\u2019ve managed to land an interview (which is already a lucky break, considering how many resumes didn&#39;t even get chance to be there).</p> <p>Some common keywords and jargon people like to throw around include Splunk, ELK, Dark Web, DarkInt, Threat Hunting, Malware Analysis, MITRE, Diamond Model, etc.</p> <p>At least be prepared to answer some common questions.
