The mission, which includes a 350kg rover, will be developed in collaboration with Japan. ISRO is also working on Chandrayaan-4, focusing on sample collection, and has outlined plans for an independent space station by 2035. Additionally, a new rocket launch site in Kulasekarapattinam will boost India\u2019s small satellite launch capabilities. These efforts mark a significant step towards India\u2019s goal of a human Moon landing by 2040.",

Researchers found evidence of gymnosperm forests and ferns in rock layers from this period, suggesting that some ecosystems remained intact. This discovery challenges assumptions that land environments suffered the same fate as marine ecosystems, offering insights into how plants may have adapted and survived extreme climate events",

The study of LBN 483 provides astronomers with a clearer understanding of star formation processes, independent of large stellar nurseries.
