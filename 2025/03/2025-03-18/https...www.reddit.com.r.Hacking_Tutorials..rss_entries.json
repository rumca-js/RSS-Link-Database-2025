It emulates a Bluetooth keyboard, supporting commands like text input, key combinations, delays, and Ducky Script for automation. Ideal for security testing and automation, Bucky enables users to execute scripts wirelessly via the serial monitor.</p> <p>please check it out and leave me some feedback</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/rylena/Bucky\">https://github.com/rylena/Bucky</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RylenLetfTheChat\"> /u/RylenLetfTheChat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1je1nty/made_a_bluetooth_rubber_ducky_for_the_esp32/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_T",

And airodump-ng says at right corner that wlan1 interface down, Why is that? My opinion is that the wifi adapter cant hold the stress, am using some Tenda adapter cuz my Archer T2U stopped working properly. I can even send my small script that i use for ddosing if there can be the problem. What u guys think?</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/saa2g6xb1fpe1.png?width=730&amp;format=png&a",

I let this idiot (I took care of the issue if you know what I&#39;m saying \ud83e\udd4a \ud83d\udc4a) used my computer and he set his Gmail as the main email for the computer. Completely swapped mine out. Mind you, it was a newer Google Chromebook. He tried to steal it and I caught him so I handled that onsite, but when I opened up the computer again I now have to login his actual Gmail password to bypass this issue or then I&#39;ll have all my local data on my hard drive erased. If I type the wrong password in it moves me to a page that says &quot;OS Verification is off press space to enable it&quot; .Now I was thinking of using AI to code a BadUSB or Keylogger, but before I do that, I wanted to reach out to good ole reddit. Being that there are some really helpful folks on here that know a whole lot more about tech than me, I&#39;m hoping to find some help with this. Now this fuckboy that did this btw is behind bars right now ",
