That happens also to be exactly what transpired when they faced Arsenal in the 1932 FA Cup showpiece, a game that became known as the North v South Final and aroused such interest that even George V turned up. Indeed, the first fans from Tyneside arrived more than two days before kick-off, reaching Wembley just after midnight whereupon, according to the Guardian, they \u201cmade themselves comfortable for the night under a hedge in the Harrow Road\u201d.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_",
