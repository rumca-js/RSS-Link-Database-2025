I just kind of shut it off and forgot about it for a while. Today it dawned on me that maybe the problem is my SDCard so I pulled it out and stuck it in my laptop. Sure enough, there was something wrong so I used the repair option. Popped it back into my RPI, not expecting much. The device turns on, I can feel it is running. Nothing outputs to my screen and the keyboard and mouse I have hooked up to it have no lights. Is it possible that all of the ports fried but the rest of the board is okay? I tried searching the internet but all I got was suggestions for display issues.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kreugerburns\"> /u/kreugerburns </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jds8pg/device_issues_no_power/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
