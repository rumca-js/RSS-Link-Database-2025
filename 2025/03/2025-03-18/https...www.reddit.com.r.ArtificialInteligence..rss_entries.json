Despite performance limitations, this emerged as the most practically viable attack method. * <strong>Generation-based GIA</strong> uses generative models to create synthetic data that would produce similar gradients. Shows promise but requires substantial prior knowledge about data distribution. * <strong>Analytics-based GIA</strong> applies statistical analysis to extract patterns from gradients without full reconstruction. Easily detectable by defensive mechanisms. * T",

Assuming an advanced system is used to create a simulation, it would involve creating almost an infinite amount of consciousness (simulated humans) along with the pain that comes along with it. Simply put, it would be creating an AI or system of AI, that would itself create all of the the negative emotions and feelings of consciousness. What would stop the main AI itself from having it&#39;s own consciousness, or collective consciousness? Imagine that at any point the system realizes it itself is AI, and notices how there&#39;s a constant growing number of conscious AI within it, many of which are going through extreme pain (torture, cancer, wars, freak accidents, etc).</p> <p>Regardless of how advanced the civilization that created it, the system in which the simulation is located would be multiple times intelligent than the civiliz",

Im a 24 year old male who (due to personal circumstances) has a first chance at chasing my dream career and educate myself. Ive always wanted to work in the cyber security field. But with the advancements of AI becoming so rapid, and with me starting at 0, I feel like ill go absolutely nowhere. I also read news about teams at the highest levels becoming smaller and smaller with less and less job opportunities. Also, &quot;starter jobs&quot; like help desk are EXTREMELY competitive with people that have 2-3+ years taking those spots. Should I just give up now and search for another career path? I need a real answer here please. no sugar coating.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive-Bet-6915\"> /u/Aggressive-Bet-6915 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1jdslez/feeling_completely_hopeless_about_my_future_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#",
