        "description": "<p>The thirtieth anniversary of the publication of American Tabloid is the perfect time to read one of the darkest fictional examinations of the murder of John F. Kennedy.\u00a0 It is more than arguable that his killing slammed into overdrive the undermining of a segment of the American people\u2019s belief in their government.\u00a0 For those of an academic bent, a reading of Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay published a year after the Kennedy assassination titled \u2018The Paranoid Style in American Politics\u2019 where the right cannot accept society as it currently is, and uses demagoguery to undermine and replace it with their approved version, felt of a time then, and most certainly today. The story of Kennedy\u2019s assassination long ago curdled into myth and legend, the Ur-conspiracy of the American dream, an event upon which all people of a certain inclination paint their wildest, weirdest and darkest fantasies as a way of explaining what they believe American secretly is.\u00a0 Cuba, communism, the Mafia, Zapruder",
