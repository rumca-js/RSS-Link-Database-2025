At around 200 pages, it\u2019s a quick one, but since I\u2019m used to heavier books, it felt like a refreshing change. For me, this easily falls into the fantasy category. I struggle with books that don\u2019t allow me to vividly picture scenes within minutes, but this one had no such issue\u2014I was instantly immersed. The tea ceremony, in particular, played out so clearly in my mind, as if I were watching it unfold in real time.</p> <p>I also loved how traveling through time shaped each character\u2019s perspective, even when they couldn\u2019t change the present.

I kind of want to spend the next few months reading back stories of shows and movies that I didn&#39;t know were options. Does anyone have a tie-ins that they would recommend that I may not know existed? Books similar but not necessarily Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens, or Predator. I&#39;m excited to hear what tie-ins you&#39;ve enjoyed reading! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TyrionsGoblet\"> /u/TyrionsGoblet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jdyiqn/books_tiedin_with_tv_series_or_popular_movie/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jdyiqn/books_tiedin_with_tv_series_or_popular_movie/\">[comments]</a></span>",

He finds the pocketknife the ghost had when he was alive, and finds -- if I remember correctly -- the dead boy&#39;s name carved into the bedframe. The book then becomes a mystery as the boy tries to find out how the dead boy died. Maybe he was murdered? Or fell into a river? Whatever happened, the boy&#39;s ghost can&#39;t rest until the truth is known.</p> <p>I&#39;m sorry this isn&#39;t much to go on, but that&#39;s all I can remember. For some reason, the book has stayed with me for 4 decades. It wasn&#39;t Hardy Boys.
