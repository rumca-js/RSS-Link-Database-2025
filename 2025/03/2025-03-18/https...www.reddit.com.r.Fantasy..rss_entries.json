Tried Sanderson but found him long-winding and boring. Same with Rothfuss. Haven&#39;t found much interesting fantasy outside of Malazan, except for Donaldson which was excellent. I liked Cook, Bakker was OK. I am not particularly worried about tropes if the books were written in a time when they were not tropes.</p> <p>With the Riftwar saga, do they feel YA like Sanderson, or are they more mature? I like it best when books are written in beautiful prose, but it is not a requirement as long as the prose is not annoyingly bad and the story is fun with relatively fast pacing.</p> <p>Edit: please, keep spoilers out of the comments in case I decide to pick up the books..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",

Now my partner and I are listening to The Cruel Prince together on audiobook, and for the most part it&#39;s been great, but I have one issue -- I hate how the reader voices Cardan</p> <p>In my mind, Cardan is a funny, snarky, sarcastic bitch. It&#39;s like 90% of his charm. But the reader portrays him with this very flat and aloof voice, even when the text indicates that he should be expressing a lot of emotion. My partner said she&#39;s not the biggest fan of his voice delivery either</p> <p>I&#39;m debating just reading her books 2 and 3 myself.

It is also the place for anyone with a vested interest in a review to post. For bloggers, we ask that you include the full text or a condensed version of the review but you may also include a link back to your review blog. For condensed reviews, please try to cover the overall review, remove details if you want. But posting the first paragraph of the review with a &quot;... &lt;link to your blog&gt;&quot;? Not cool.</p> <p>Please keep in mind, we still really encourage self post reviews for people that want to share more in depth thoughts on the books they have read. If you want to draw more attention to a particular book and want to take the time to do a self post, that&#39;s great! The Review Thread is not meant to discourage that. In fact, self post reviews are encouraged will get their own special flair (but please remember links to off-site reviews ar",

Obviously like in most fantasy books their relationship improves but WHAT is up with the second male love interest (or one of two) always being a horrible sometimes or straight up abusive but all is forgiven because there was a secret reason behind all of his actions.
