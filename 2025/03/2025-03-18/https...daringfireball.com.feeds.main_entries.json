If it finds any, it can then reclaim the disk\nspace taken by all but one of the identical files\u2009\u2014\u2009<em>without\nremoving any of the files!</em></p>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/#how-it-works\">learn more</a> about how this is done, if you\u2019re\ninterested, but the short version is that Hyperspace uses a\nstandard feature of the macOS file system: space-saving clones.\nThe Finder does the same thing when you duplicate a file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love everything about this app. I love the name\u2009\u2014\u2009it \u201cworks\u201d in like at least three ways. I love that it\u2019s right up Siracusa\u2019s alley. I love that Siracusa has talked about it, at wonderful length, on ATP and <a href=\"https://hypercritical.co/2025/02/25/hyperspace\">expounded up",

It\u2019s a company\nweighed down by its market capitalization and what stock market\nexpects from it.</p>\n\n<p>They lack the moral authority of Steve Jobs to defy the markets,\nstreamline their product lineup, and focus the company. Instead,\nthey do what a complex business often does: they do more. Could\nthey have done a better job with iPadOS? Should Vision Pro receive\nmore attention?</p>\n\n<p>The answer to all those is yes. Apple has become a complex entity\nthat can\u2019t seem to ever have enough resources to provide the real\nApple experience.
