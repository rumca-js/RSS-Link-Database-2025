I have domain names, Verizon fiber Internet, five static IP addresses, and server hardware running Linux. But I have just enough network experience to shoot myself in the foot. My goal is to securely isolate my webservers from all other devices on my LAN. My plan is to use one static IP to connect devices on my LAN to the Internet and one or more of the other IP addresses to expose my web servers to wild web. I do understand that I must configure DNS for my domains. I also know how to assign static 192.168.1,x addresses to my devices. But what I don\u2019t know is how to configure my router, if necessary, to assure that LAN traffic traffic is protected from from possible exploits attacking my webservers.</p> <p>Can some kind soul guide me through to success?</p> <p>Incidentally, my ultimate goal is to host my websites on Incus Linux containers. But I need to walk before I run.</p> <p>Many thanks",

However, after more than a decade of Gmail, I got extremely used to their management of emails with labels, instead of old style folders. I just love and use heavily, that an email can have one or more labels. I find this superior to folders. If an email comes in, filters assign one or more labels (or I add manually more) and if I read it, I &quot;archive&quot; it (remove the &quot;Inbox&quot; label).</p> <p>This workflow cannot be reproduced with folders, as with folders, emails would usually be copied and thus would be present more than once.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alexs77\"> /u/alexs77 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jeau5s/m",

Its running HAOS, so nothing else. But, i want to be able to run more, like Ollama and Pterodactyl (Game servers) on the same machine. I figured i would be able to do it with Proxmox, but not all on a single Pi, right? I don&#39;t want to rent a server, so i would like to get an server in my room, but, i don&#39;t know where to start. I found an Dell optiplex on facebook for 65\u20ac but that was also 8gb and not upgradable. I have a budget from around \u20ac100 - \u20ac300, as i&#39;m currently 14 years old and don&#39;t have much money :) Does someone have a setup like this?

But I feel like I have hit a roadblock. Most of us here need a simple login screen and that&#39;s what tinyauth wants to do (and already does) but there is always that teeny tiny feature you would like to have. So instead of packing it with useless features that nobody will use I would really like to know your favorite ones. Additionally I would really like to know what features (or configuration options) tinyauth has that are completely useless an you think that I should remove them altogether. Again thank you for your support and I am looking forward to your ideas!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

I have to tweak the dockerfile often and thought that offloading the building and serving to a container on proxmox might be the way to go. I found several solutions but most of them are either way too much or do not have all the elements to them. Specifically - WebUI, Building, Registry. The closest I got to it was using Gitea with actions but I get the impression there might be a better suited solution. Portainer can build images from Dockerfiles directly from the GUI but not act as a registry. Harbor seems to be the best suited for this though configuration seems complicated.</p> <p>Please let me know your thoughts and if I am missing an obvious solution here.

That was the nudge I needed to finally buy a SFF PC and explore the intriguing world of self hosting. My initial plan was small - just get up and running with what I lost on my Shield, then eventually expand to Plex/Arrs/game servers.</p> <p>Advice here said to start with proxmox and use a linux distro VM to host my services as docker containers. Sweet, sounds fun.</p> <p>The Proxmox part has gone ok. I love the fact it natively allows me to operate the PC headless and the flexibility to pivot and bail on a plan. I setup an Ubuntu VM no problem. Even managed to get an LXC running with Cockpit and 45 Drives to act as a NAS. Mounted the samba share in linux - AWESOME.</p> <p>My problem is with Linux/Docker.

For most services, it would only be me accessing them, but for certain ones like my SearXNG instance, PrivateBin, and maybe Miniflux, I might want to allow others access.
