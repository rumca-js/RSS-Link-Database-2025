I&#39;m talking about the basic &quot;Look for artist, download mp3&quot; that people used to do back in the late 00&#39;s. Maybe I&#39;m just used to series and gaming piracy over music, but I genuinely do not understand why platforms like Spotify have to be hacked when getting your music for yourself on your own devices is much easier and simpler.</p> <p>Or if you really want streaming and go through the extra effort, you can set-up a simple plex server for music with your own music. No more hassle. </p> <p>It all boils down to having the music yourself. Why people prefer streaming?</p> <p>Or, one step further, why pirates treat streaming music and streaming films/tv completely different?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EvenHornierOnMain\"> /u/EvenHornierOnMain </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"htt",

It\u2019s frustrating because there\u2019s so much valuable information that could benefit everyone if only it were accessible!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking for AI services that can connect with these research papers and help answer my questions while properly citing the sources. I think it would be amazing if there was a tool that operated similarly to platforms like Pirate Bay, driven by a \u201chuman welfare\u201d motive. Access to knowledge shouldn&#39;t be restricted, right?</p> <p>I\u2019m curious if: Any AI tool exists that provides this kind of service? It can deliver answers with proper citations from those inaccessible papers? I&#39;ve dabbled with some services like SciSpace, and while useful, they don&#39;t quite meet my ideal of free access.
