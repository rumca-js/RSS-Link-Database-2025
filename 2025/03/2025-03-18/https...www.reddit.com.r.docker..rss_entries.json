While that does work, managing the copies and restoring involves a lot of manual steps.</p> <p>My main use case is to restore local postgresql db volumes to its former state after rebase / sync db migrations from me and my coworkers.</p> <p>On my machine I am able to restore a 50gb volume which was compressed to 8gb in around 1min40s.
