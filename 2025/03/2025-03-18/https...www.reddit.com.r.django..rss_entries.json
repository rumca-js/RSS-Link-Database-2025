Using runserver in developement made me chase that bug for 2 days.</p> <p>By using an http/2 compatible server like hypercorn, I was able to get rid of the issue.</p> <p>Now, for production... I&#39;m behind Nginx and I have http/2 working properly on it. Couple questions for experienced devops here:<br/> - Is there a performance difference between Nginx with http2 + an http/1.1 server behind like uvicorn? Should I aim for http2 all the way?<br/> - What are your general insights for performance when it comes to an app with SSE? Should I keep Gunicorn in WSGI and send SSE traffic to an ASGI serve",
