Despite their utility, these constructs often introduce performance overheads by invoking copies and moves of captured member variables, leading to increased complexity and unexpected behavior. I will share practical examples and common pitfalls encountered in real-world applications. Finally, I will present an alternative approach I have developed to mitigate these issues, offering a more efficient and reliable solution for developers.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Limitations_and_Problems_in_StdFunction_and_Similar.pdf\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n",
