Founder Wang Chuanfu said this &quot;super e-platform&quot; tech offers a peak charging speed of 1,000 kilowatts, twice that of the 500 kw charging currently offered by Tesla&#39;s superchargers. That would mean a car can travel 249 miles (400 kilometers) from a five-minute charge on a BYD station. This charging architecture will initially be available in two of BYD&#39;s vehicle models: the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV.</p>\n<p>&quot;In order to completely solve our user&#39;s charging anxiety, we have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of petrol vehicles,&quot; said Wang.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>",
