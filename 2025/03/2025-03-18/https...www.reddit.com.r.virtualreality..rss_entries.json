        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>in the spring sale I bought NMS on Steam. Only wanted it for Vr.</p> <p>However, I can&#39;t play longer than 15 min max till it crashes. It just freezes, an hourglass loading symbol appears, and then crash. It always says that Steam VR had a critical error. So looks like the game causes Steam VR to crash and then of course, subsequently NMS crashes as well. </p> <p>I am using a Meta Quest 3 connected to my PC via cable and Quest Link. </p> <p>Specs of pc: RTX 4070 I5 13600 Tomahawk B760 32 GB RAM 2 TB NVMe Win 11</p> <p>I&#39; ve seen older posts of people having trouble with NMS VR and that some update a year ago apparently broke VR for many people. Couldn&#39;t find a proper solution searching through these posts. </p> <p>Maybe someone found a solution in the meantime? </p> <p>Kind regards and thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SupremeLeaderX\"> /u/SupremeLeaderX </a",
