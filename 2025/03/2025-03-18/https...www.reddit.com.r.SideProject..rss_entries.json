They had to go through long pieces of content, find specific words, and link them one by one\u2014every time. It sounded like such a repetitive, time-consuming task, so I built a tool to automate it.</p> <p>It&#39;s called <em>The LinkMapper</em> (<a href=\"https://thelinkmapper.com/\">https://thelinkmapper.com/</a>), and it scans text, automatically turning matching words into links based on a CSV file you upload. You set the rules once, and it does the linking for you. No more manual <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m at the stage where I\u2019m trying to get real users and see if this is actually useful beyond my own workflow. Eventually, I\u2019d love to monetize it, but for now, I just want to refine the idea.</p> <ul> <li>Have you ever dealt with this issue yourself?</li> <li>",
