But for the past few months, it started doing wierd things. Like when I\u2019m doing grocery shopping and click new tab, then come back to the previous tab, it refreshes me and puts me back at the top, when i was in the bottom page. A bit of a hassle all the time. Then I have the problem whilst watching youtube. When I click to another video, the page just refreshes back to the previous video, or while watching a 5hour video it refreshes by itself and goes back to the start, which is quite a nuisance again. Is it a browser thing or a computer thing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lilypoplolly\"> /u/Lilypoplolly </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1je9rr1/opera_refreshing_the_pages/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1je9rr1/opera_refr",

Yesterday I was tired started having migraine attack, finished cooking in pain, but as it got worse I crashed on bed asking daughter to take &amp; eat food by herself this time as I was not feeling well. She was asking something from the other room I tried to answer but she didn&#39;t hear me, as I had no energy to get up or shout from here, my migraine was getting worse, I gave up, asked her to come to me but she didn&#39;t. She got pissed off that im not answering her Q properly. and then after a while she said, &#39;get off from the bed go to other room&#39; as she wanted to sleep there. I begged her to eat &amp; sleep but she didn&#39;t do anything just sat there in the living room not bothering anything about me or what I was trying to say or in what condition I was in. She acted very cold with no slightest bit of care or concern on me. It was zero. It triggered me badly,",
