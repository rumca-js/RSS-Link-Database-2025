Ex. Player A has 2 Aye, B has 1 Nay, and C votes 2 Nay, then the Nays have it without A getting a chance to re-up their vote if they really want to fight for a certain outcome.

It felt caveman-esque. The world seemed to be devoid of vegetation and the only way to get these materials is by hunting large monsters. If successful in hunting them the surviving tribesmen divvy up the spoils, which could be various assortment of bones to be used as upgrade or crafting materials for gear and of course meat for your tribe to eat and heal.

I am giving it a review and that is because this game is in its second printing for this kickstarter however the \u201cMarvorren Expansion\u201d box is new and hence I will not comment on how it plays. I am also not an employee nor influencer for them at all.</p> <p>Gudnak is a grid based tactical card game for 2-4 players however i find it works best in 2. It is a CCG?? (i think that\u2019s the term) so like a trading card game however every card is included in the box no need to scavenge for them, and there is obviously an element of deckbuilding within that. If I were to compare it to games I\u2019ve played I would compare it to almost unmatched cross magic the gathering almsotttt bit of a stretch but it\u2019s hard to define which is honestly a great thing because of it\u2019s uniqueness. That said though I have heard it be compared it to \u201cSummoner Wars\u201d however i\u2019m yet to play the game myself.</p> <p",

So we didn\u2019t get far. But our pawn was already up to 32 demand after just 4 turns. We are just 4 demand away from losing already\u2026</p> <p>As I understand before the start off each turn you add two boxes from active callers to the map, and they\u2019re low demand, So 2-6 demand gets added each turn. Once you\u2019re at 23 demand you only take 1 active caller but it\u2019s replaced with high demand. So for 2 turns you can get away with only adding 1-3 demand but then you\u2019re adding 4-5 per turn. </p> <p>At the pace these trucks start out at\u2026 it seems impossible at first glance to deliver even 1 package before you hit 36 demand and lose. </p> <p>What am I not understanding here? I\u2019m super excited to get into this game more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Puzzleheaded_Air1030\"> /u/Puzzlehe",
