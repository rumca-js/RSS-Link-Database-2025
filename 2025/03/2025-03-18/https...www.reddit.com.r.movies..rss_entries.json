Going by the timeline, it implies he was referring to JFK, who has Irish roots (&amp; is someone Frank seems to admire).

As his friends awkwardly attempt to woo girls their own age, Herman slowly befriends Dorothy and finds himself becoming increasingly in love with her, until a sudden tragedy changes their lives forever. I loved this film it\u2019s shot well especially the scenes on the beach and it set the tone of it being in 1942. Robert Mulligan directed the film who directed To Kill A Mockingbird which is one of my favorites and he did a great job directing this film, it\u2019s worth checking out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikeyboy101591\"> /u/Mikeyboy101591 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jdu9cb/summer_of_42_1971/\"",
