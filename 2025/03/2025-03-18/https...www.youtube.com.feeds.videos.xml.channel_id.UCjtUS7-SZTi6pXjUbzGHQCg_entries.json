It sounds like a joke\u2014or maybe a paradox. But what if the future of warm, cozy homes lies in freezing water? As outlandish as it seems, an English research team is working on a heat pump that runs off actual ice \u2026 well, more like slushies. It\u2019s a serious effort to tackle one of our biggest energy challenges: how to affordably convert buildings over to high efficiency electric heat pumps. But how can an ice source heat pump raise temperatures through freezing?\n\nWatch Why Isn\u2019t This Revolutionary Battery Everywhere? https://youtu.be/3_NCnxO1KLY?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-ice-might-be-the-future-of-heating/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/solar-guide\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio",
