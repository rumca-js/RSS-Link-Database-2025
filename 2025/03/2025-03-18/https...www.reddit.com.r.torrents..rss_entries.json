Would the solution be to simply remove that listing in Network Interface? </p> <p>0x - 6x a day, the Connection Status will be a red globe and I found if I reset my port, or sometimes reset qbittorrent and Proton as well, it ll all work again. </p> <p>What I THINK is happening is Proton will have a burp, reconnect, and I have to reset it. I use this Network Interface with Proton VPN as kinda a backup Killswitch, just in case... Any thoughts? And, is there any other work around?
