At long last, the astronauts are en route back to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon capsule. Along with NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, Williams and Wilmore departed the space station early Tuesday at 1:05 a.m. ET. The group of four, known as Crew-9, is expected to splash down off the coast of Florida around 5:57 p.m. ET.",
