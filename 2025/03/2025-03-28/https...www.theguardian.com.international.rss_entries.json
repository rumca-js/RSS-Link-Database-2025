The&nbsp;1992 title poem \u2013 which recently enjoyed a second life on TikTok, with users showing off their fruit-based tattoos \u2013 finds the author buying a large orange, sharing it with two friends and concluding: \u201cI love you. I\u2019m glad I exist.\u201d After the Lunch is about falling in love on Waterloo Bridge while \u201chigh on the charm and the drink\u201d, while Being Boring hails the virtues of a drama-free life (\u201cNo news is good news, and long may it last\u201d).</p><p>Cope is the reader, her delivery gently understated and frequently deadpan. In Loss, she reflects on the end of a relationship in which the woman \u201cwent through hell.

To say that the cast of Apple\u2019s new two-part, feature-length documentary series is stacked would be an understatement, and that truly is only a smattering of its many interviewees: I\u2019d be here all week if I listed every single one. A celebration of black excellence in Hollywood, these two films are produced by the likes of Jamie Foxx and Kevin Hart, and stuffed full of household names who have made it to that coveted No 1 spot on the call sheet \u2013 in other words, the top-billed star of a production. They also offer a potted history of how black actors came to thrive in Hollywood \u2013 and the struggle baked into almost every stage of that process.</p",
