And while those messaging apps work fine, some still seek out alternatives that lean hard into a promise of security and privacy\u2014like Signal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a> is an end-to-end encrypted app (E2EE), which means it encrypts every message <em>before</em> it leaves your device, and that message can only be read <em>after</em> it arrives on a recipient\u2019s device and gets decrypted. As it travels in between, even if it were to be intercepted, it couldn\u2019t be read thanks to the encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, other apps like Messenger and WhatsApp also employ end-to-end encryption. So, what\u2019s so special about Signal? And how did it become part of a small firestorm in US politics this week? Well, the <em>app</em> isn\u2019t the problem",
