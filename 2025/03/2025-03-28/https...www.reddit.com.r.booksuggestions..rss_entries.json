I do like the superhero and action part of it, but I wouldn&#39;t say those are my top reasons for liking the show.</p> <p>I just love how real all of the characters feel. Even though half of the main characters are superheros, they all just feel kinda... normal in a really refreshing way. None of them are perfect people and they don&#39;t always have interesting lives, but they all have their own character arcs that are really fun to see. It&#39;s rare that I like almost every character in a show. </p> <p>I also like how the show never keeps things calm for too long and there&#39;s always something around the corner that totally defies my expectations. It&#39;s never boring and even the slower, more character driven moments are exciting to watch. </p> <p>I&#39;m mostly a fantasy/sci fi reader and my current read is the Shades of Magic series by V.E.

I tend to see romance as the ultimate goal of a story and if the MC does not end up with anyone(which is the case with a lot of novels, and that&#39;s fine too.), I sometimes go wonder what he will be doing afterwards that will hold meaning to him? However, when I try to find a romance based novel, most of them are for women, and in a lot of cases, they don&#39;t write men well. Actually, I&#39;ll say it differently. There are no characters that are &#39;not written well&#39; as long as there are people enjoying it, so I&#39;ll say they write it in a form that does not interest me. I also like the fantasy genre, but it doesn&#39;t need to be specifically fantasy. So can I have a story with a romance as one if it&#39;s main genre with a male perspective?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hopeful-Attempt-6016\"> /u/Hopeful-Attempt-6016 </a> <br/> <span><a h",
