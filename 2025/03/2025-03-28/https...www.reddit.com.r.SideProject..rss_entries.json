I watch a lot of long YouTube videos\u2014mostly health podcasts, deep dives, and sometimes summaries of topics I&#39;m researching. I often need the full transcript to feed into ChatGPT for summarizing or just for reference.</p> <p>But it always annoyed me that YouTube doesn\u2019t have a &quot;copy transcript&quot; button. You have to manually open the transcript panel, scroll forever, and select everything\u2026 and even then, it\u2019s clunky. I tried using AI summariser extensions, but honestly, I don\u2019t like those mini pop-up windows. I prefer doing things manually\u2014just give me the raw transcript, and let me paste it wherever I want.</p> <p>So I built a Chrome extension for myself that lets you:</p> <ul> <li>Copy the full transcript of the current YouTube video with one click</li> <li>Download the transcript as a <code>.txt</code> file</li> <li>Remove timestamps if you want</li> <li>Add/remove th",

The existing libraries didn\u2019t fit my needs, and tweaking them didn&#39;t work. The only solution? Build my own tool to generate the exact component I envisioned.

It stems on a recent paper I read on the detrimental effects of the internet and how it affects our critical thinking skills as well as our knowledge. We read, but we don&#39;t retain. </p> <p>One of the contributive factors is the idea that when we read things online (which are nowadays short-formed), we don&#39;t have enough time to develop connections, recognize patterns, and critically analyze that we&#39;re reading. It&#39;s even worse with AI now giving even faster summaries to whatever you need to know.</p> <p>As an experiment, I built a web tool called Altior, designed to push back against this. The core idea is that it doesn&#39;t give you direct answers.
