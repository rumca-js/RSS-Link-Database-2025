First up is the closure of Mountaintop Studios and their free-to-play game, Spectre Divide, and after that, we\u2019ll be talking about the weird narrative around Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows and how people somehow thought one game would save Ubisoft from its current troubles.\n\nIntro - 00:00\nSpectre Divide\u2019s Failure - 00:35\nAssassin's Creed Shadows - 06:12\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SecondWindGroup\n\nSecond Wind Merch: \nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/second-wind\nhttps://sharkrobot.com/collections/second-wind",
