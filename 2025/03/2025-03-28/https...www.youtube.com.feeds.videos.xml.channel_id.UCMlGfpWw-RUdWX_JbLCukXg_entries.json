From its inception, we intended that design to offer a modest-but-useful set of features with a solid foundation on top of which we will be able to incrementally grow an easy-to-use, rich, and extensible C++ meta-programming framework.  This keynote will review some of the fundamental tools proposed in P2996 and follow up with a vision for some additional capabilities that we\u2019re working on.\n---\n\nSponsored by ",
