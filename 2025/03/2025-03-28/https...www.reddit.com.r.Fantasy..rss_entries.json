Bonus points, if the book follows the education of the main character in any sort of school or other place, in which the MC needs to learn new skills, compete with others etc. - something with similar structure to &quot;Nevernight&quot;, &quot;Assassin\u2019s Apprentice&quot; or &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, but with none of the lessons focused on fighting.</p> <p>Are there any high fantasy novels out there like that? I&#39;m specifically NOT looking for any sort of cosy fantasy, like &quot;Legends &amp; Lattes&quot;, but for something with high stakes and lots of worldbuilding.</p> <p>(also any queer recs that fit are more than appreciated!!!)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lejowka_jadowita\"> /u/le",

Since the final book of Christopher Ruocchio&#39;s <em>Sun Eater</em> series is releasing this November, I wanted to make this post to see if there was any interest in doing a subreddit read-along for the series starting in May. We&#39;d do 1 book a month with the standard two discussion posts (mid-book and end-of-book) and our final month would be November with <em>Shadows Upon Time</em>.</p> <p>For those who don&#39;t know, the Sun Eater series is an epic science fantasy series inspired by <em>Dune, Hyperion, Book of the New Sun</em>, and <em>The Vorkosigan Saga</em>, in which the protagonist Hadrian Marlowe chronicles his own life story leading up to him destroying a sun and killing billions of people to defeat an alien race. We know the ending of the series right from the first pages\u2014the story is an elderly Hadrian retelling the story to us. In that sense, it&#39;s drawn comparisons to <em>The Kingkiller Chronicles</em> and <em>The Farse",

However, when I try to find a romance based novel, most of them are for women, and in a lot of cases, they don&#39;t write men well. Actually, I&#39;ll say it differently. There are no characters that are &#39;not written well&#39; as long as there are people enjoying it, so I&#39;ll say they write it in a form that does not interest me.
