Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.<br><br>There are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job \u2014 but it may cut your bandwidth in half.
