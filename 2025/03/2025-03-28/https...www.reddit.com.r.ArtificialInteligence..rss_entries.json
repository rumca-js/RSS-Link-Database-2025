This however does not mean that the origin of the token does not matter. In fact, the origin of the tokens will depict the distribution of the problem. A language model can certainly model the visual world, but it would have to be trained on the distribution of visual patterns. If it only has been trained on text, then image problems will simply be out-of-distribution.</p> <p>To give you some intuition for what I mean here, try to solve one of these ARC problems yourself.
