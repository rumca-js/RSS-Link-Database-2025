But <em>highly precise</em> time is important in many industries, especially robotics, finance, and media production. And with tech like VR working its way into homes, precise time may become more important <em>there</em>, too.</p>\n\n<p>The timing industry has many solutions for 'grandmaster' clocks, which take in highly accurate time from GPS, GNSS, or other atomic-clock-backed time sources, and distribute it to local networks with <em>extreme</em> precision\u2014down to the nanosecond range\u2014using ",
