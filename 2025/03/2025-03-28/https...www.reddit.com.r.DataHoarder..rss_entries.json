I have a windows PC and an unraid server that I will be backing up. The windows system has around 300gb of backup data, and the unraid server has around 3gb (appdata and system shares). I have a backup share on the server that I am backing up both windows and unraid to using Kopia, but I would like to add cloud backups to this as well.</p> <p>This is where I could use some advice on how to set things up. Ideally I want to use as little bandwidth as possible, so doing incremental backups would be nice. I also want the setup to be easily adjustable for adding more devices on the future. It would also be nice to have everything be uploaded from the unraid server, as that one is online 24/7 so the uploads can be scheduled during the night.</p> <pre><code>PC -&gt; Unraid -&gt; Cloud Unraid ^ </code></pre> <p>My first idea was to spin up a second instance of Kopia on unraid that backs",
