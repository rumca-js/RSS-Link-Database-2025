Think Splendor Duel, Azul: Duel, and other spin-offs of already successful games that work decently well with two players, but now get dedicated two-player versions.</p> <p>Sure, great two-player games have always existed (I\u2019m a big fan myself), but this feels like a different pattern. Are two-player experiences really becoming that dominant in the market? Or is this just a clever way to resell already popular titles in a new format?</p> <p>We\u2019re also seeing a rise in solo games\u2014maybe not quite at the same pace, but it\u2019s notable. And it\u2019s interesting, because while board gaming is often seen as a social/group activity, we\u2019re seeing a lot of love for 1-2 player experiences.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it and it\u2019s just a coincidence with a few recent releases\u2026 but what do you all think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

All his games are unique and give rise to fascinating player interactions at the table. I&#39;ve been playing Molly House and constantly thinking of playing it again and again. Even though I&#39;m an experienced board gamer, I feel like I&#39;m maybe missing other experiences like Molly House, John Company and Pax Pamir, where 1) players have to negotiate and sometimes make alliances due to varying endgame conditions, 2) there is an historical scenario, where players collectively manipulate an outcome. Honestly I would be interested in any game with a similar feel or that create unique player dynamics. Maybe wargames? I just feel that most wargames will not have a theme so interesting as Wehrlegig games. Suggestions? Thanks! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Still_Philosopher_35\"> /u/Still_Philosopher_35 <",

Each player has a deck of cards that have images. A category is selected; Example Love. People search in their deck of images and put down the 5 images that they think describes the category. Example; Rose, ring, couples holding hands. I don&#39;t remember how one wins, but if you match similar cards with other people you both get points or something. I remember that some of the images were between 80s to 2000s. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SithLordHomer1\"> /u/SithLordHomer1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jm0zq9/cant_remember_the_name_of_a_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jm0zq9/cant_remember_the_name_of_a_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The map is expanding and randomized like a rogue like. Rapidly and simultaneously, all players role a set of dice to get what they need to move to a new floor or unlock items needed to escape.

Upon hearing the third signal, they need to escape the temple.</p> <p>Why: Unique mechanics that aren&#39;t gimmicky. The gameplay is intense both both with friends and solo. The game is conveniently 10 minutes max with a very simple setup and straightforward explanation and relatively low price. The physical game design is very good and comes with additional piec",
