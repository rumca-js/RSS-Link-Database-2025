It is an experience I will carry with me forever. By the end of the movie I felt empty, confused, and kind of let down as many others Im sure have felt. But as my day went on and I reflected over what I had watched, that feeling started to grow. And gets only stronger whenever I think back to the movie, the themes and its plot.
