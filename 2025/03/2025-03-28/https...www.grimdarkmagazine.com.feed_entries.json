        "description": "<p>If you thought fantasy romance was all sickly sweet cuddles and kisses, then R.A. Sandpiper is here to prove you wrong in A Pocket of Lies. Filled with cutthroat schemes, brutal fights, electrifying tension, and deadly deals, this fast-paced grimdark fantasy romance is an absolute gem of an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. Okay so if you ever feel like your life is utter shit, just read A Pocket of Lies and remember that Suri is probably having it way worse than you are. After our lovely little spitfire of a thief suffers a very humiliating robbery, she goes into full-on revenge mode and decides to abduct and impersonate a foreign princess at the royal ball. Except, her crazy con soon goes absolutely tits up, which ends up leading to her exile into the cursed wastelands on a deadly mission to assassinate the dark and notorious Fae lord Kol. And that, my friends, is only the start of this glorious trainwreck of an adventure. Now, if there is one thing I love in books, ",
