        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Democrat Party has lost touch with the voters completely. Their only hope of regaining power is to rig the system in their favor. That\u2019s what the Wisconsin Supreme Court election next week is all about. Speaking of losing touch, Tim Walz declares that Democrats need to proudly embrace DEI and wokeness. I, for one, think that\u2019s a great idea for them. And Thomas Massie introduces a bill requiring lawmakers to divulge if they are dual citizens with another country. How is that not already the law?\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:26 Opening\n02:02 - 14:22 Democrats Reveal How They Will Change The Rules To Take Back Power\n15:50 - 21:45 Tim Walz Claims The Left Didn't Lean Into Wokeness Or DEI Enough\n21:45 - 26:26 Legislation Proposed To Require Political Candidates to Disclose Dual Citizenship\n26:27 - 33:43 Pennsylvania Senator Says Female Bodies Are Just As Strong As Male Bodies\n33:44 - 37:30 Kristi Noem Sends A Clear Message To Criminal Illegal Aliens\n37:40 - 4",
