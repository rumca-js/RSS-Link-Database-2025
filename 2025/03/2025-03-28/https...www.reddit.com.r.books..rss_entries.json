His monotone narration of all the songs is almost unbearable. When he gets to a song I will literally stop the audiobook and listen to the song off of the movie soundtrack then skip ahead in the book.

And I loved how patient both leads were with each other. </p> <p>But my favourite part of it was the commentery on love and relationships. Emma growing to learn how to love properly and Justin learning how to be more forgiving and empathetic, really spoke to me, like i couldnt help but see myself in them. The way it navigated Emmas trauma was also great imo, how she took accountability for her actions and did not really use the trauma as an excuse. I loved how everything wasnt okay immedietly and that it took her time to figure things out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/okuneedtochill\"> /u/okuneedtochill </a>",

The tragic story of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz is similar to that of many American tribes: broken treaties, abuse, forced assimilation, and even a long death march after the bloody wars fought in southern Oregon. They were tricked into terminating their tribe by local political interests in the 1950s, but recovered it in the early 1980s by relinquishing their ancestral rights to hunting and fishing. I was pleased to read that, just this year (2025), the Siletz Tribe has at long last fully recovered its hunting, fishing, and gathering rights. The book is an interesting, if somewhat dry, history of a group of Pacific Northwest tribes that many Americans have likely never heard of.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveRT78\"> /u/SteveR",
