Initially, \"Ghibli\" (\u30ae\u30d6\u30ea) comes from an Italian word pronounced with a hard \"G\" (as in \"gift\"). This Italian word means a hot wind from the Sahara Desert, symbolic of the studio's intent to introduce fresh, new winds into the animation industry. Miyazaki, who has a profound fascination with aviation, specifically named the studio after the Italian Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli aircraft. This historical aircraft also carried the Italian pronunciation, solidifying the hard \"G\" sound.",
