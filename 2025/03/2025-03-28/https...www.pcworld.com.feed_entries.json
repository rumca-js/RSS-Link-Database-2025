Screw a smart bulb into a socket. Done! If you\u2019re looking for something with more elegance and sophistication, however, you should replace the switches in your walls. Besides, the most common drawback of relying on smart bulbs with conventional switches is that someone inevitably turns the switch off. Boom! Your expensive smart bulb is now a dumb bulb that can\u2019t be controlled with voice commands or be included in any lighting automations you\u2019ve set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there\u2019s a downside to converting to smart in-wall dimmers and switches, it\u2019s installing them. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s an easy DIY project. Be aware, however, that most\u2013but certainly not all\u2013smart controls depend on the presence of a neutral wire in the box.
