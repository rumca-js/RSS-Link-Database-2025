I&#39;m playing only VR (90% PCVR), started to mod years ago with VorpX, tried UEVR (too complicated for me) and stuck with Luke. My VR setup is a HP Victus 15L with an i5 13400 and a RTX 4070 Super OC and a Q3 as well as QP headset. Games I own and tried that could be VR modded with Luke&#39;s mods are Atomic Heart, Avatar, Cyberpunk, Far Cry 4/5/6/New Dawn, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Zero Dawn and Watch Dogs. If I would rank the games for their Moddability (is that a word?), it&#39;s Avatar first (hands down), followed by Cyberpunk, Atomic Heart, Far cry 4 and 5 and New Dawn. These games look stunning (even with the 4060 I had built in prior) and are smooth. Setup is real easy, in most cases you don&#39;t have to tweak much. Avatar is just breathtaking in VR and looks more like a &quot;real&quot; VR game than the others. Cyberpunk is a close second, Atomic Heart a close third. T",
