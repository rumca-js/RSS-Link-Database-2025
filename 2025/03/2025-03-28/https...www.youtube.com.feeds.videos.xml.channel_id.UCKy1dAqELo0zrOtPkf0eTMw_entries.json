        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe Legend of Zelda movie finally has a release date: March 26th, 2027. For such an anticipated project, Nintendo chose the most low-key way of announcing the date: via their new Nintendo Today news app. They did just have a Nintendo Direct yesterday, which did not contain any mention of the movie, and they also have a Switch 2-focused Direct next week; both of those would have more obvious options to drop the news. Elsewhere in games, Ubisoft and Tencent have formed a new subsidiary company that will handle some of Ubi's big IPs like Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and Assassin's Creed. And finally, new Sims challenger InZOI is still in early access, and players have already found a bug that will let you run over children with a car. Yes, it's already patched.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo",

This week Daemon is joined by IGN's Community Lead, Jada Griffin, and regular Game Scoop co-host Mark Medina to look ahead to the PlayStation 6. There have been tons of games announced during this generation that still haven't seen the light of day, and the chances of them being PS6 titles grows greater with each passing financial quarter. Games like the Splinter Cell remake, Star Wars Eclipse, The Elder Scrolls 6, and more have a good chance of missing the PS5 completely. Plus we have last week's poll results. Let us know in the comments what already announced games you think should be held for the PS6's eventually release.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5",
