        "description": "On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Ryan Furrer. He's a Front End Engineer working on tools that help companies monitor their buildings for energy usage, water leaks, and other environmental factors. Ryan dropped out of college and worked as a musician and violin instructor before teaching himself how to code, working freelance, and ultimately landing developer jobs.\n\nWe talk about:\n- Life as a broke musician\n- Teaching yourself to code while working full-time\n- How Ryan had to move back in with his parents after a divorce\n- His 5-year journey to his first developer job\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 11,384 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible. You can join them and support our mission at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\n\nOr you can listen to the podcast in Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app. Be sure to follow the freeCodeCamp Podcast there so you'll get new episodes each",
