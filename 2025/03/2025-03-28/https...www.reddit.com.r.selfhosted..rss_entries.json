I read online that the best way is to use Prometheus as data source and Alma provides a package for prometheus-podman-exporter and that should allow me to easily monitor containers and pods easily. What I don&#39;t understand, as I don&#39;t have any experience with Prometheus nor Grafana, is how do I connect Prometheus to the Podman exporter. Do I need a Prometheus instance on every server I monitor or can I have just one server that pulls data from the VMs that run the exporter? How does the exporter expose the data? In the docs its says that it&#39;s exposed via HTTP or HTTPS but on which port? Do I need an intermediate Prometheus or can I just pull the data from the exporter directly on Grafana?</p> <p>Any help will be appreciated. If you can point me to any tutorial/explanation online that would be great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

My husband has some in Apple Music that are 600+ tracks long, and so we used Soundiiz to map them in Plexamp. There are multiple problems though:</p> <ul> <li>You can&#39;t sort songs in playlists in Plexamp!</li> <li>In Plex, you can drag and drop but you also can&#39;t sort them!</li> <li>Whenever Lidarr finds a better version, renames files, updates metadata, etc, it seems to mess up the playlists. We need a static pointer to the song, no matter what it ends up upgrading/renaming to.</li> </ul> <p>Is there already a tool (or combination of tools) that makes this an actually <em>good</em> experience?

Synapse and Coturn?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/uffno\"> /u/uffno </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jllrd2/synapse_cloudflare_caddy_nginx_coturn_i_dont_get/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jllrd2/synapse_cloudflare_caddy_nginx_coturn_i_dont_get/\">[comments]</a></span>",
