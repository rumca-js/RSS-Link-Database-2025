I was wondering wether anyone has experience using industrial sensors on a raspberry pi and could give me suggestions. Ive found this: <a href=\"https://store.ncd.io/product/1-channel-4-20-ma-current-loop-receiver-16-bit-ads1115-i2c-mini-module/\">1-Channel 4-20mA Current Loop Receiver 16-Bit ADS1115 I2C Mini Module - NCD Store</a>, but im not sure wether it will work or not. Ive tried using BT from the sensor (--&gt; sensor manifacturer told me that id have to reverse-engineer the entire sensor) and using a camera to digitally read the value on the sensor, but as u can imagine, it only gave more issues since the data is gonna be used in a closed loop PID and delay has a big impact on it.</p> <p>Any help is appreciated :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Artistic_Tie_7",
