This company focuses on compliance for ISO, PCI DSS, and other standards.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in getting into cybersecurity, particularly leaning towards GRC roles. While I&#39;m not entirely sure if auditing is the path I want to take, this internship is the only opportunity I have lined up at the moment. I&#39;m also working on my Sec+ certification.</p> <p>I would really appreciate any advice on whether this internship would be beneficial if I don&#39;t plan on pursuing auditing as a long-term career, as well as any general tips for breaking into GRC.<br/> Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Puzzleheaded-Mode908\"> /u/Puzzleheaded-Mode908 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1jm7lvz/o",
