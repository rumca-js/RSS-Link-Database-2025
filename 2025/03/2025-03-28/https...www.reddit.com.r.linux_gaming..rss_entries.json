Running MH Wilds now I get similar performance to the 3070, but the card is not really trying too hard. I&#39;m on Mint 22.1, updated kernel to 6.14, have kisak-mesa 25.0.2, updated linux-firmware to the most recent one two days ago. Set the system power balance to performance, installed LACT and enabled overclocking (kept everything default for now), set performance level to highest clocks. Any other ideas to get more performance out of the card and basically force it to max out the power draw in demanding situations? I think the hardware itself is installed properly, running OCCT gpu stress test I got it to draw up to its 317 W limit consistently.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
