I&#39;m debating on which would work out easier in terms of pricing for both cables and automatic switchers. I use mostly Generation 5-7 consoles and most of my consoles already have simple HDMI digital solutions installed (IE: GCVideo, Electron Shepard X-out, Backward Compatable PS3) and look great with the HDMI input on my retrotink 4k CE. But I&#39;m considering moving everything over to either scart or component for compatibility with the SVS or other switcher options as well as making it easier to connect older consoles when my collection grows since older systems almost never have digital out solutions that are plug and play.</p> <p>I&#39;m not expecting anyone to calculate pricing for me, I just want to hear some some personal experiences.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/frillyseal\"> /u/frillyseal </a>",
