        "description": "Dollhouse: Behind the Broken Mirror wants to tell a creepy story by having the player dive into the mind of its protagonist, Eliza de Moor. While a celebrated singer, Eliza one day collapses in the middle of her performance. On waking up to find out that she has lost all of her memories, Eliza agrees with Dr. Stern\u2019s plans to bring her memories back by taking Eliza back to her hometown.\n\nUnfortunately, the slow movement speed and tedious combat tend to sap any sense of fun that could be had in the game. While there is certainly an admirable attempt at setting up a thick atmosphere that makes the player tense around every corner, the general lack of polish in both gameplay and visuals end up making the very idea of playing Dollhouse: The Broken Mirror a frightening one.",
