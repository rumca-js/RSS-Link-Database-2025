Currently I do a lot with alteryx workflows and powerBI dashboards, but I\u2019m moving in a few months and I think this gives me an opportunity to pivot.</p> <p>For reference I have my A+, Network+, Security+, and will should have my OSCP in roughly a month. Additionally I have a bachelors in cybersecurity complemented by two minors in information systems and computer science. Additionally I do have experience building machine learning models.</p> <p>One note is in August I\u2019m moving to Northern California (Sacramento). </p> <p>Anything helps!</p> <p>Skills Penetration Testing &amp; Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Metasploit, SQL Injection, Buffer Overflows, Privilege Escalation, Active Directory Exploitation, Windows &amp; Linux Post-Exploitation, Mimikatz, Empire Network &amp; Security Analysis: Nmap, Wireshark, BloodHound, CrackMapExec, Impa",
