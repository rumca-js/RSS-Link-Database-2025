I think part of it is because we don&#39;t use joysticks on PC or consoles anymore and that does make a lot of games like that tougher to play with mouse. I remember one space sim coming out that went mouse only and got a lot of flack for it - can&#39;t remember the name. </p> <p>Is joystick to mouse what killed the space fighter genre or was there something else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krandor1\"> /u/Krandor1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jcyt7a/what_killed_the_spacefighter_genre/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jcyt7a/what_killed_the_spacefighter_genre/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It&#39;s almost meditative and has been very therapeutic for me. </p> <p>Any other games like this that come to mind? Fromsoft games are like this a lot of times, especially Sekiro, but there&#39;s still a lot of exploration and (often vague) storytelling going on. Sifu has a story, but it&#39;s more of a vehicle for the gameplay, which is not an issue, just different. I feel like it allows me to get into that flow state easier than a lot of games. </p> <p>As I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve steered away from action games in favor of slower paced RPGs and strategy games. I&#39;m realizing I&#39;d like to shake it up with some games that focus more heavily on mastery of skill based combat.
