I am not looking for more debates on whether free will exists or not, I want a contemporary book from an author who either does not believe in free will, or who assumes a life without it within the book. I have already read Determined by Robert Sapolsky, and I really enjoyed it, but the focus was much on the arguments for determinism rather than how I could learn to live my life to the fullest in a society where everyone believes in free will. Looking for a light read, with perhaps some philosophy and psychology, but mostly self-help to overcome the daily challenges of living in a(n emergent) society when I keep thinking reductively.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ketchup0701\"> /u/ketchup0701 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jcud7b/book_about_living_life_wit",
