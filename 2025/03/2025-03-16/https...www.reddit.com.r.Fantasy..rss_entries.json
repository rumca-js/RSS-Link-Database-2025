The deeper we chase an ideal, the more it seems to slip into something monstrous.</p> <p>Some of my favorite stories tackle this idea not just as a dystopian warning but as a philosophical meditation.

So I&#39;ve been quite excited to read his new series that&#39;s been in the works for some time, and was thrilled when he reached out to me in January offering me an ARC of the book.</p> <p>Sadly, I ended up struggling with this book despite liking quite a few things about it, and have ended up a month late on the review.</p> <h1>Premise</h1> <p>The setting of the book is one inspired by <em>Hades</em>, the indie video game created by Supergiant Games, and seemingly also inspired by <em>Small Gods</em> by Terry Pratchett, as well as Bierce&#39;s fascination and research into megastructures. When a person dies, a god is created out of their death relating to who the person was in life or the circumstances of their death. Worshippi",

If this is the system, then how is it possible that Yona was warden for so long, and then that Uka won the Aktibar at 15 despite obviously being much older than 25 when she becomes warden? I know I must be missing something simple but I just have not been able to figure it out on either read. Please share your interpretations (without any spoilers for ",
