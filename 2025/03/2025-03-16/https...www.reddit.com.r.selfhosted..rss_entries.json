I need it to just be accessible via a web browser, but I&#39;m not sure the best way to do this securely. Is it fine to just have immich and jellyfin raw to the internet (with proper user permissions and linux security like fail2ban)? I&#39;ve tried using cloudflare access, but having to reauthenticate every and try and use warp is also still pretty tedious. I do have a reverse proxy on a VPS with nginx.

I&#39;m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and other programming languages, and I&#39;ve recently started hosting my own Git server using Forgejo. I figured it would be good practice since I want to become a developer and will soon be starting an online computer science degree. Previously, when I finished a project, I would use GitHub Pages to deploy it, but now that I have my own Git server, I&#39;d like to get away from GitHub Pages and find a way to deploy demos of my projects on my own server. I&#39;ve been trying to do this with a post-receive Git hook, but it&#39;s not working very well and requires manual configuration for each repo. Can anyone suggest a better way?

My understanding is the proper way is to use ssh keys, when I try and learn about using ssh keys people are logging in via password to load and generate key pairs. Password login doesn&#39;t seem to go away when using keys it just seems to skip it when the keys are involved, am I correct in that once you setup your keys you would the disable password use or create some insanely overly complex root password and basically not use it? Thanks for any clarification I am still kind of confused about using keys but I have a work server that I need to be as secure as possible and right now I just have an obnoxious root password that I store in vault warden.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Squanchy2112\"> /u/Squanchy2112 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comment",

I have been running a NAS for the past 15 years which has slowly evolved into self hosting. Started with some crappy cheap 2 HDD NAS enclosure of 1 TB, had 1 HDD gone bad. Changed the HDD managed to not lose any data, installed OMV in a new box. While ok with Linux the fact that every time I wanted to do something I had to read in here or watch a 30min long YT video started becoming annoying for the use case. Switched to an old PC where I installed Windows 10 which worked fine (ResilioSync, Tonido, Plex work fine).</p> <p>The use case of self hosting is basic: personal file hosting, pictures across all mobile devices of the family, videos that I take from car trackdays and that&#39;s all (basically wanting to replace iCloud and GPhotos). Not even needing it available 24/7, syncing once per week is more than fine. P",
