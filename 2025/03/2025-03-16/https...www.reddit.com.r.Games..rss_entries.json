The goal is to defeat tha main boss at the giant candy castle and go through different candy-themed biomes (like chcolate, gummy, cake, etc.) with candy creature enemies getting more and more difficult, similar to most roguelike concepts. In order to keep up with the increasing difficulty you have to find DONUT upgrade shops and perk stations.</p> <p>Right now I am working on a playable prototype for playtesting on the way to the demo for windows PC (no release date yet).
