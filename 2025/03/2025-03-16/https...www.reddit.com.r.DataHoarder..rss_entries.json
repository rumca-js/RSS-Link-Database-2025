Privacy and security are important to me. My files should not be visible even to the cloud storage company I use. Also, I\u2019m looking for a long-term service.</p> <p>I know you would suggest Proton Drive for privacy reasons, but although I like all of Proton\u2019s other services, I\u2019m not satisfied with Proton Drive. Its desktop and mobile apps feel too slow and insufficient. I&#39;ve also heard negative things about data privacy with Google Drive and OneDrive.</p> <p>At this point, the service I have in mind is MEGA. What can you say about MEGA? Do you think it is reliable in terms of privacy and security?
