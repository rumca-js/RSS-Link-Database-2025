        "description": "Every video game has the potential for greatness, even if the premise, gameplay, visuals and whatnot aren't for everyone. However, you may never know this without first getting past the opening. And for every amazing title out there, you must slog through the initial hours to get to the good stuff.\n\nWhether it's a sequel like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth that spends too much time catching up with the previous game's characters, the non-interactive opening and lack of fun gameplay tools in Watch_Dogs, or the agonizing handholding and tutorialization of Pokemon Sun and Moon, some games really demand the most of your patience.\n\nFortunately, they tend to pay off or at least showcase why you shouldn't judge a game by the first hour. Check out 12 such video games here and what made their openings such a chore to get through",
