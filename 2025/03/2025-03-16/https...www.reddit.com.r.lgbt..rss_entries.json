We\u2019re being pushy, obnoxious, entitled even. We\u2019re making everything about ourselves and shoving it down their throats. </p> <p>Poor, poor homophobes are just trying to mind their own business, but- the gays! They\u2019re everywhere! On the news, in TV shows (gasp!) In PUBLIC?! Things were better when gay and trans people were shamed into the shadows and they could live in peace, pretending we didn\u2019t exist. Or, at least, that\u2019s the attitude they take on when we tell them kicking LGBT teens out of their homes isn\u2019t cool or that gayness/being trans by itself doesn\u2019t hurt anyone.</p> <p>It just sucks that it\u2019s 2025 and we STILL have to deal with assholes like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",
