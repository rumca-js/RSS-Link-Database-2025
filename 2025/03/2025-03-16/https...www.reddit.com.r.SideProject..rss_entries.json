Ranger solves this by connecting to your Gmail, parsing email receipts, and using AI (OpenAI structured outputs + Zod for type safety) to clearly summarize transactions.</li> <li><strong>Automatic Bank Balance Reconciliation:</strong> Zero-based budgeting requires accurate balances. Ranger keeps balances accurate by intelligently cross-checking transactions, automatically self-healing discrepancies without needing manual intervention.</li> </ul> <",

I wanted to do something different, something I could actually be proud of.</p> <p>Initially, I built a few custom Excel tools to speed up my own workflow, mostly just to free up some time to brainstorm side hustle ideas (had few ideas but quickly dropped it). But then I realized those little Excel tricks were actually saving me hours of tedious work every week and I feel like maybe other people might find them useful too.</p> <p>So, I spent the last year using my time after work to build these tools into a proper Excel Add-in. There were a lot of late nights, way too much trial-and-error with code, nasty bits on website creation, and now with my website launch, the SEO is absolutely a headache.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m fi",

Here\u2019s the situation:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Folder Storage for Course Files</strong>: Users can upload files related to the same course, and we organize them into folders. This makes sense for keeping everything related to a course in one place.</li> <li><strong>Individual File Features</strong>: Our product also offers features like summarizing videos/audio, extracting notes from PDFs, and creating mind maps. These features seem more intuitive when applied to individual files rather than entire folders.</li> </ol> <p><strong>The Question</strong>: How do I balance these two aspects in the UI? Should I prioritize the folder structure for organization, or emphasize individual file functionality?

I\u2019ve been working on Lumin Gallery, a web app for reading news quick and fun. It fetches posts from <a href=\"/r/news\">r/news</a> and displays them in a clean, animated grid. It uses Python with PRAW to scrape Hot, New, and Rising posts, then runs sentiment analysis on the top 10 comments via Groq\u2019s API and automatically every 4 hours (github actions)</p> <p>Built it over a few evenings\u2014Python for the backend, HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.
