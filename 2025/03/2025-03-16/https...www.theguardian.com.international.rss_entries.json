The results, from a team led by Prof Huan Zhong at Nanjing University, China, are not definitive and require corroboration. But analysis showing that plastics could limit photosynthesis (the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy) must be taken seriously. If the researchers are correct, and staple crops are being reduced by about 12%, there are huge implications for global agriculture and food supplies. This could inject new urgency into efforts to tackle plastic pollution.</p><p>There is no single rout",

It meant that industrial warehouses were thrown up along the banks of the Thames for much-needed storage. Almost two centuries later, only a handful of those Victorian storehouses survive, but those that do have been regenerated, inspired by the renovation of New York\u2019s loft apartments in the 1980s.</p><p>For South African interior designer Veronique Hopkinson, a historical home \u2013 specifically, a warehouse in London \u2013 was always on the bucket list.
