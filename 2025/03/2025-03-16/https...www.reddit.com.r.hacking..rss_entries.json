That feeling of \u201cWhere do I even start?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find the right information?\u201d would slow me down more than anything. But that changed when I listened to a podcast about Kevin Mitnick\u2019s life.</p> <p>His story was incredible\u2014his curiosity, persistence, and unconventional learning methods completely shifted my mindset. Instead of hesitating or doubting myself, I started embracing the process of digging deeper, exploring different sources, and figuring things out on my own.</p> <p>If you\u2019re in the cybersecurity community or just getting into it, I highly recommend reading his autobiography (Ghost in the Wires) or listening to a podcast about his life. His journey is not just about hacking\u2014it\u2019s about thinking differently, adapting, and never stopping the search for knowledge.</p> <p>For me, this wasn\u2019t just inspiring\u2014it was a game-changer.</p> </div><!-- SC",
