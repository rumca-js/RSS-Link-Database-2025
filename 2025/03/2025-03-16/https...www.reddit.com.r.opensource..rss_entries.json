Since then, I&#39;ve occasionally noticed traffic to the site (via <a href=\"http://Bunny.net\">Bunny.net</a> stats, I don&#39;t have analytics) and also received a few emails from users.

But a lot of problems don\u2019t actually need that, sometimes you just need a small model that does one thing well without the compute overhead or black-box weirdness.</p> <p>Been working on SmolModels, an open-source tool that lets you train small, self-hosted AI models from scratch. No massive datasets, no fine-tuning a foundation model, just structured data in, small model out. Runs anywhere, doesn\u2019t lock you into some API, and actually gives you control over the model you\u2019re using.</p> <p>Repo\u2019s here: <a href=\"https://github.com/plexe-ai/smolmodels\">SmolModels GitHub</a>. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to mess with AI without dealing with all the usual ML nonsense, would love to hear what you think. What\u2019s been your biggest pain with AI so far?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pa",
