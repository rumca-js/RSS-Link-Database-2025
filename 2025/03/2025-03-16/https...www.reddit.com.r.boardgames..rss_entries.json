The small worker can only carry one item, the medium two, the large three items. If a small worker and a medium worker arrive at the same space, the small worker is &quot;fast&quot; and gets to pick one item before the medium worker then picks up two. This often results in situations where you place your large worker on a space but get nothing (or a &quot;consolation soup&quot; in Critter Kitchen) because by the time the small and medium workers at the same space are done, all the resources are gone.</p> <p>I&#39;m positive I&#39;ve seen this mechanic in another game before Critter Kitchen, but I can&#39;t think of what game it was, and it&#39;s driving me nuts.
