His forefathers had covered up a midnight suicide at a remote railroad crossing, a bootlegging ring run from a courthouse, and the attempted murder of a pregnant lover. Alex, too, almost walked away from his unspeakable crimes with his reputation intact, but his downfall was secured by a twist of fate, some stray mistakes, and a fateful decision by an old friend who\u2019d finally seen enough.</p> </blockquote> <p>I&#39;m not generally interested in violent true crime s",

If you think about it they\u2019re kind of similar in the sense that both were discarded as silly when first published and got pretty bad reviews. But somehow between the 1840s (I believe that\u2019s when WH was published?) and now it\u2019s become a classic and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too far to say that twilight has a chance of doing the same. </p> <p>And of you think about it I think it makes sense that twilight will become a classic.
