This allows for using gzdoom for Doom, OpenGothic for Gothic II, and alot of other examples similar to that, especially where the source port is alot better than the old Steam exe.</p> <p>I updated luxtorpeda-dev a while back to check daily for new release tags for an engine, which made it easier to detect when any of the 100+ game engines have an update, as well as providing a simple pull request with the necessary changes to switch to that release, baring any issues that have to be manually looked at.</p> <p>I recently in the last few days updated this to also support engines that don&#39;t use releases",
