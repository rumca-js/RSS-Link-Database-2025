For almost 100 years now, they have been looking for a theory of quantum gravity to solve the problem. But one of the most general expectations of a quantization of gravity is that space also has quantum fluctuations. And a team of researchers from Caltech now says they\u2019ve got a tabletop experiment which could find those fluctuations. Could this solve the problem? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThis video comes with a quiz which you can take here: https://quizwithit.com/start_thequiz/1741928692440x673776072344993800\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to r",
