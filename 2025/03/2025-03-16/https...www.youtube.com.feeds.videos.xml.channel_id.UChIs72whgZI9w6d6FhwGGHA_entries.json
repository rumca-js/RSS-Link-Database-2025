We'll also benchmark and review the card for its thermals (GPU and memory temperature), frequency and clock behavior, and RPM response to GPU temperature. We've already benchmarked the RX 9070 XT for gaming performance and power consumption, so you can check out our full review for that (using this same card).\n\nGrab a GN PC Building Anti-Static Modmat here: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\n\nWatch our AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP0axVHdP-U\nAnd our Fake MSRP video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPE95_RnL_Q\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
