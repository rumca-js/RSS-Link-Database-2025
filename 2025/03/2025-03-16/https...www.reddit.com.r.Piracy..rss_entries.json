I have been told about Real-Debrid and Stremio and caved in for it. Bought 3 months of Real-Debrid with PaySafeCard and connected it to Stremio. Got the right addons (such as Torrentio RD, MediaFusion RD and Anime Kitsu RD) and now able to watch everything on all devices (iPhone, PC, Android tablet and Android Tvs).</p> <p>Best of all, the quality of Stremio is so much better than any other platform out there (Netflix, Disney, Prime whatever). User Interface is good and quick, no annoying startup logo.</p> <p>Feel like I no longer need a VPN because, Real-Debrid also provides quick downloads with DDL links (together with JD2). I should\u2019ve caved in way, way earlier.</p> <p>So, thanks everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CurrentRisk\"> /u/CurrentRisk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

I don&#39;t know if this community is the right one to ask this, sorry in advance if it isn&#39;t, but, recently I&#39;ve tried to pirate some very old video games, from Windows 95 to Windows XP, and unfortunately the DRM of that time is super annoying, most of them need activation codes and/or having the disk always mounted, and in the websites where I found them there was no patch or password, so I need to edit the game code to skip the DRM window, and, if possible, also modify the game assets, since one of the ones that did work always crashes in the same part of a cinematic, so I thought about extracting it and fixing it with some video editing program, or just delete it so the game skips it, i tried using Guidra, but what I&#39;m looking for is more to be able to extract the assets themselves and be able to view them and convert them to a normal format and re-convert them back to the game format, instead of doing a complete reverse engine",
