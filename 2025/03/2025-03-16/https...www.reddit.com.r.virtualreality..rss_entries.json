I realize this is quite difficult, but it&#39;s necessary for my requirements. The approach I took was to use Proxmox to create 3x VMs, each VM with a dedicated GPU.</p> <p>My current specs plan is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>GPUs: 3x Gigabyte RTX 4060 OC triple-fan</li> <li>CPU: Ryzen 9 7950X</li> <li>RAM: 2x32GB DDR5 5600 MT/s</li> <li>Case: full tower Phanteks</li> <li>PSU: NZXT 1200W Gold</li> <li>Motherboard: Asus PRIME X670-P WIFI</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m pretty sure the virtualization part should work, as I am aware this was successfully tried before, e.g. I know LTT did it several years ago with Unraid. My main concern is the motherboard. Ideally, I would buy a high-end workstation motherboard, but I&#39;d prefer if I did not have to.</p> <p>This motherboard has 1x PCIe 4.0 x16 slot directly connected to the CPU, and 2x",

I do surveys to make a little bit of money to buy games right now I have 25$ of in store credit and really wanna buy a new co-op game to play with my brother soon. Right now I&#39;m between into black, horror simulator, magitek looks good, maybe medieval dynasty, maybe war of wizards, maybe after the fall, and finally but most controversial I really like the idea of silent North because it&#39;s a new idea that hasn&#39;t been done in VR before and looks okay, I know combat waffles studio isn&#39;t very popular but it really seems like a fun game. So if anyone has any opinion on this or has more suggestions please send them my way \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vrpersonthe5th\"> /u/Vrpersonthe5th </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comm",

Lately they&#39;ve been having an issue where their tracking is constantly messing up. Their avatar just flies of in random directions or twists up in knots, and one of their hands constantly just jerks around randomly. They have the controllers and four vive 3.0 trackers (feet, waist, and headset) all paired to dongles. The dongles are spread out about 6 inches apart from each other, and they have them plugged into two USB 3.0 hubs, three dongles per hub. We&#39;re at our wits&#39; end trying to figure out why this issue is occurring. There&#39;s not any reflective surfaces in their playspace and they didn&#39;t have any issues like this when they were using the Index. If anyone can offer recommendations on potential solutions we&#39;d appreciate the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",
