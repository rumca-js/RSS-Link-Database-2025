        "description": "SpaceX has launched the Crew-10 mission from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, sending four astronauts to the ISS. The team will replace Crew-9 members, two of whom have been stranded since June due to Boeing\u2019s Starliner delays. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off successfully on March 14, and Crew-10 is expected to dock with the ISS in about 28 hours. The six-month mission will ensure station operations continue smoothly while awaiting Starliner\u2019s long-overdue crewed flight.",
