He got John Carter, Battleship, and True Detective, but after a few flops, he just stopped getting those lead roles. Same thing happened with Josh Hartnett. In the early 2000s, he was in Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down, Sin City, and then he just kind of faded away. I heard he turned down playing Batman in The Dark Knight, which probably didn\u2019t help.

What I found quite different about thsi movie form everything else I&#39;ve ever watched is the lack of dialogue and busy on-screen motions is it gives you so much time to think about Jeanne and how she&#39;s acting. You can process through how she goes about her days in relation to you, and reckon with your preconceptions about what a home life is like for women like her.

I just wish we got more of him, his scenes were the best. My revisiting this movie will mainly consist of going on YouTube to watch his scenes.

It came out in 1993, and I&#39;m pretty sure I was closer to 7-8 when I watched it. The reason my mother let me pick it out (from a VHS RENTAL STORE, GASP HOW ANTIQUATED) was because it had a kid in a ghost face costume on it walking with a guy she must have assumed was his father (Costner).</p> <p>Nah, this was about a pair of murderers who break out of prison and kidnap said kid, kind of a road movie with Eastwood as the Texas Ranger chief who is chasing them. It&#39;s worth a watch, it&#39;s a decent movie directed by Eastwood however as a kid it was scary to me. The ending is a gut punch too, was one of my first &quot;anti-hero&quot; sad movies. </p> <p>Anyway, anybody else got stories like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HughJManschitt\"> /u/HughJManschitt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/m",
