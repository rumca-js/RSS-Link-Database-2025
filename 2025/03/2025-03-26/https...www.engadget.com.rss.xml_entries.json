The new installment arrives on May 30.</p>\n<p>Although EA didn&#39;t offer much detail about LiDAR&#39;s use, we can safely assume it involved high-resolution 3D scans of real-world tracks to make them as close to a 1:1 representation as possible.

We at Engadget are focused on tech, and while the selection this time around isn\u2019t quite as good as that of Amazon Prime Day in July, there are some decent discounts to be had. Some of our favorite robot vacuums, air purifiers, headphones and storage gear are on sale right now for some of the best prices we\u2019ve seen this year so far.<br><br>Below, you\u2019ll find all of the best tech deals we could find in the Amazon Spring Sale. The shopping event runs through March 31, so be sure to check back for the latest deals as they become available.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-amazon-spring-sale-deals\">Best Amazon Spring Sale deals</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bf44867345b14a29b21afa08dc4fc98b\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Magne",
