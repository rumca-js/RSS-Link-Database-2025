        "description": "Welcome to London, the capital of the United Kingdom and its largest city. It has been the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country for centuries. The city dates back to Roman times when it was founded as Londinium around 47 AD.  We\u2019ll journey to some of the city's most popular spots like Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace and the London EYE. London is a city where every corner has a story to tell, from its centuries-old structures to its modern buildings. Sit back, relax, and let\u2019s explore this amazing city together.\n\nNote: we have filmed and published tours of London before, but they were filmed almost 10 years ago, and only available in monoscopic format. We thought it was high time to bring you a new and improved version of this wonderful city, and hope you'll enjoy it :)\n\nClick the *Join* button now to become a VR Gorilla YouTube member, unlocking access to the full video and our complete collection of full-length videos. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6AXBF-",
