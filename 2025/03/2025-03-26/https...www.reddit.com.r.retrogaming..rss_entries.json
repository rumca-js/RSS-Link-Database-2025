It was based very loosely on D&amp;D. It was half graphics and half text based. There was a VERY simple graphical endless maze you could walk in any direction and you would encounter things that would be described in text. You could find a couple gold pieces in a pile of refuse or fight a monster. Can&#39;t remember if you would level up, but you would accumulate gold and better weapons. I think I remember fighting a Dracula as one of the powerful monsters. Does any of this ring a bell? I would spend hours staring into that phosphorus green screen roaming the maze when I should of been studying. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swix32\"> /u/swix32 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jkoj4j/trying_to_remember",

You were a player that had to run around these temples or islands. There were paths you had to follow, and you were trying to gather... Coins? before you ran out of time. At the end of the timer you had an extra minute but there was this shadow guy that followed you around and didn&#39;t have to stay in the set paths. During this minute your anxiety got worse because even if you ignored the timer the game made this creepy sound whenever he was on screen.

Do you all have any recommendations for which one to start with? Some of the deciding factors are library of games (obviously), the price of the actual console and the ability to be able to still buy one, and how accessible the catalog of games is.</p> <p>For single player stuff I\u2019m mostly looking for RPGs especially if they have a good story, combat, or both.

Now i want to find that game and platform:</p> <p>Space shooter - always right type of game. (Horizontal)</p> <p>It was controlled by a keyboard, i cannot recall if it was DOS or any other system.</p> <p>Basically you were controlling a spaceship, shooting fast firing lasers. I do not know if there were more weapons, i remember i couldn&#39;t bend-back my finger once as i was holding fire key for an hour or two so it stuck in one position:)</p> <p>I think fire was a spacebar and arrows for ship control.</p> <p>The graphics was very simple, 8bit i think, most of the game was purple. Spaceship was very simple i think a triangle. The game stars outside a space base and you fly into a base with enemies. I think i has &quot;X&quot; in the name.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to search for it but the closest one i got is Zynaps but its not the game. Please help</p> </div",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey there! New to this sub so apologies if this isn\u2019t the place for this. I\u2019m back in Japan for the first time since I was in high school, and back then all I wanted was to visit Super Potato and find some cool Japanese only game I could bring home to play/admire. (Was a big Elite Beat Agents fan so the OG Ouendan was my white whale then.) Unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to make it on that trip- so I\u2019m determined to finally reach the promised land this time!</p> <p>I think I\u2019m going to love just being there frankly, but I\u2019m also hoping I come across something fun to bring home. I have a modded GBA and an analogue pocket so any GBC or GBA game would be something I could play (I think? Not sure what region locks existed for those), and I have a jailbroken 3ds, so I think those games are on the table as well? But also - clearly I love a cool portable so I\u2019ll definitely be looking out for anything particularly wild as far as old handhelds go.</p> <p>Just w",

You were in control of a ship, top down view. You could speed up , slow down, turn right and left, AND drop depth charges. It was frustrating, cant remeber if there were other screens.... Eventually a sub (off screen) would launch a torpedo and hit you from the side.</p> <p>Was a game that probably got passed around, no manual. It was not a side view, or a view of subs underneath. The graphics were good for the time, but can&#39;t remember if there were other screens for navigation etc.....</p> <p>The most striking feature i remember was holding down the fire button caused the depth charges to launch farther from your ship. The fired from the aft, launching from both port and starboard.</p> <p>Of course, no manual ment just pressing all keys unti you figured out the game.
