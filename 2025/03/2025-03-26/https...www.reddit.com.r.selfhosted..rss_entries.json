I think a lot of people realize this too and so people are more sympathetic than before when it comes to developers adding monetization, but there doesn&#39;t really seem to be a consensus around what the best option is for devs to be compensated.</p> <p>The options I imagine are:</p> <ul> <li>accepting donations</li> <li>offering a free version &amp; enterprise version</li> <li>free selfhosted &amp; paid cloud hosting</li> <li>license nag (like Immich)</li> <li>free software, paid enterprise support</li>",

Is there any issues if I configure the server OS (thinking of starting w/ ubuntu) in a separate nvme SSD along with a NAS hhd connected on my main desktop, then later on transfer the nvme and nas hdd to a new build? Would there be any complications to doing this? My main daily-use nvme and OS would not be involved.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/decentlydelirious\"> /u/decentlydelirious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jkhs69/setup_server_os_in_my_main_desktop_then_move_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jkhs69/setup_server_os_in_my_main_desktop_then_move_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Everything works perfectly from another device in my LAN (192.168.3.x) <strong>as long as AirVPN is not connected</strong>.</p> <p>The problem is: when I connect the VPN using <code>Eddie-CLI</code> (AirVPN client with Network Lock enabled), only ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (CasaOS web interface) remain accessible. All other services stop responding on the local network \u2014 even though they are correctly exposed and mapped on <code>0.0.0.0:PORT</code>. The VPN is working fine to connect the server to the internet.</p> <p>I already allowed local IPs via AirVPN settings (<code>netlock.allow_private=true</code>, allowlist for LAN IPs, etc.) without success.</p> <p>Has anyone here faced a similar issue?

This VM runs a few Docker containers managed by Portainer and stacks, and I have configured Nginx as a reverse proxy.</p> <p>Nearly every installation guide I\u2019ve seen uses an individual bridge network. It works well, and my services are reachable from the internet with SSL certificates and wildcards.

After hours of configuring Git, Gitea, SSH keys, and setting up VS Code (yes, I\u2019m on Windows\u2014don\u2019t judge), I finally got everything working.</p> <p>Being able to manage Docker containers and run docker services straight from VS Code on Unraid is amazing. But adding, committing, and pushing changes to Gitea feels tedious.</p> <p>It feels like Gitea might be overkill for me, but I wanted to ask in case I\u2019m missing something. So aside from Docker Compose files and Home Assistant PyScript files, what else would the average self-hoster use Gitea for? Emphasis on \u201caverage,\u201d not the super-genius programmers among us.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Timely_Anteater_9330\"",
