        "description": "Official Steam OS on the ASUS ROG Ally X is awesome and runs absolutely amazingly.\nThis is REAL Steam OS on the Ally X Using the Steam deck recovery image and it looks like this just might be exactly what we needed on the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme ROG Ally X! With 24GB of LPDDR5X Ram and an 8 Core CPU with RDNA3 graphics the Ally X is faster than the STeam deck and it gets better battery life with its 80Wh Battery!  This is the Real deal Steam OS 3.8 directly from Valve not Bazzite OS. #steamos #AMD #handheld #etaprime \n\nBuy the ROG Ally X Here: https://howl.link/hoz76uzpoc2n0\nBuy An Open Box Ally X here: https://howl.link/bwgv0vrqck4mg\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% coupon code for software\uff1aETA\nWindows 10 Pro OEM Key($17): https://biitt.ly/KpEmf\nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly/RUZiX\nWindows10 Home Key($16):https://biitt.ly/2tPi1\nOffice 2019 pro key($51):https://biitt.ly/o0OQT\n201",
