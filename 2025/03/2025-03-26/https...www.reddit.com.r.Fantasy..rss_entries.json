I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m just not in the mood for Cozy Fantasy at the moment, or if something about certain books just doesn&#39;t work for me that I can&#39;t put my finger on. What have you enjoyed that&#39;s Cozy Fantasy? I&#39;d love some recommendations, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beneficial_Pea3241\"> /u/Beneficial_Pea3241 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jka90h/struggling_with_newer_cozy_fantasy_and_would_like/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jka90h/struggling_with_newer_cozy_fantasy_and_would_like/\">[comments]</a></span>",

How in the world do I filter out the junk and find what I&#39;m looking for?
