I happened to get a little out of my element so I had to run what I was doing through an AI so if the info seems way out there, that&#39;s why. I have a 64-bit custom kernel and the system isn&#39;t properly initializing the DRM and vc4 systems to populate /dev/dri with anything at all. /dev/dri isn&#39;t even getting created. From what I can tell, the start4*.elf files that are required for boot and that are available are for the older Broadcom VideoCore III and are 32-bit binaries. The theory is that this mismatch is what&#39;s causing my issues.</p> <p>Are there 64-bit VideoCore VII start4*.elf files available? The AI is insistent that they are available though I have had no luck finding any such thing. Could someone point me in the right direction with either the file or my understanding? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
