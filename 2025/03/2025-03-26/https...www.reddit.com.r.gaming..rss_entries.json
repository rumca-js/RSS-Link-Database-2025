Its like a specific reoccurring theme in soundtracks, but more specifically, you often will hear a familiar melody or string of notes within multiple songs.</p> <p>For me, I have to say Final Fantasy is incredible for this, and use leitmotifs to draw out hype (e.g., used in the middle of an epic moment or boss battle). Persona has a really cool one that spans the entire series, and then individual games may have their own leitmotifs as well. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shining_Commander\"> /u/Shining_Commander </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jk0jq5/what_game_soundtrack_has_the_best_leitmotif/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jk0jq5/what_game_soundtrack_has_the_best_leitmotif/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Not only does it not make new people want to play the game, but it also makes the already existing audience not want to play it either.</p> <p>Some of the most successful games in the last few years have plenty of complex systems, dark themes, difficult combat. Eg: Elden Ring, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, Kingdom Come Deliverance. They know what type of game they are making and who their audience is and they stick to that and do their best to try and create a game that their audience will enjoy.</p> <p>And to be fair I do think a lot of Japanese and Eastern-European AAA studios have stuck to this philosophy, I am mainly talking about Western AAA studios (especially North American ones).
