I just am beginning to think features are being stripped out just to upsell them at the same, or future, time. </p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m being conspiratorial. Maybe it is a business decision to make the core game more affordable. I am not sure.</p> <p>It just pushes me away from the game. I don&#39;t want to buy the high tier to get everything, but I don&#39;t want to miss out. FOMO. I was going to Kickstart it until I saw that. I just decided to pass on it. </p> <p>Doe",

I was able to play with a friend at first but he stopped. Played a bit of solo but got bored of it. Now I&#39;m starting chapter 17. Now is it okay to bring along 2 of my friends who have no experience with this game to join me in my game at chapter 17? Of course I&#39;ll teach them and this is an easy game to teach honestly. Will it overwhelm them? Should I run through chapter 1 (tutorial) for them first then go to chapter 17? I would like your thought please. FYI, I won&#39;t narrate the story to them since they just started in the middle of a game and I think that will be fine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jbantog\"> /u/jbantog </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jk0m6i/should_i_start_tales_of_the_red_dragon_inn_in_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <",
