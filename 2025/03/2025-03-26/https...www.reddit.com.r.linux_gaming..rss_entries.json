But, I have something to ask. First, some context. I game a lot, and some games I tested don&#39;t run on Linux, they just refuse to open using Steam&#39;s proton and I don&#39;t know why. Looking a bit more, I saw that maybe the reason this happens is because the hard-drives I use for gaming are NTFS instead of ext4 (I come from windows 11). I just wanted to know if this is really the reason for it and, if so, how to format my drives into ext4. Sorry if something here doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m still practicing my English and this is my first time ever interacting with reddit.

I bring it in &quot;PC mode&quot; and connect it via Bluetooth to my Laptop. In this mode it emulates a Dual Shock 4 Controller, hence why Steam (on Fedora Linux) recognizes it as a PlayStation Controller (X is south, circle is east, ...).</p> <p>So the Steam UI and some games l liuse these PlayStation glyphs. Long story short: how to only have XBox glyphs (ABXY) every where?</p> <p>But the functionality of the controller is perfect, it&#39;s only the presentation layer I am annoyed with.</p> <p>Any hints?</p> <p>Thx</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PearlJammer4\"> /u/PearlJammer4 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jklt57/xbox_styled_gamepad_button_playstation_glyphs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comme",

I have noticed with some of the newest games that I am have fps drops and lows where the game feels like a picture book or laggy. It&#39;s mainly in open world games or story mode games like God of War. My games are on a sata 2tb SSD so I think it should be good. I have been tempted to upgrade to ddr5 and debating on Intel or AMD. AMD has better performance but Intel looks like better 1% lows. My question is do you think that my CPU or GPU might be causing the low dips in frames. Both are giving me great performance but the lows are very noticeable and I wonder which I should upgrade first. I do distro hop still and I use cachyos.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TumbleweedAdvanced24\"> /u/TumbleweedAdvanced24 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jklpdv/cpu_or_gpu_upgrade/\">[lin",

In both operating systems I&#39;m getting very poor gaming performance. Like 15 or 20 fps less than Windows. When I pull up Mangohud, my GPU is not being fully utilized. It&#39;s only at 80 percent usage and using like 250 watts instead of the 330 it&#39;s supposed to. </p> <p>I&#39;m currently on Cachyos KDE. I&#39;ve updated Mesa to 25.1. And I&#39;m on kernel 6.14. Using a 9800x3d and gaming on a 3440 x 1440 monitor. I&#39;m also using Gamescope and HDR. I thought maybe it was a Gamescope issue so I tried without that and HDR and still same problem. </p> <p>Is this just a case that the drivers need more work because the 9070 is so new? Or is there something wrong with my system that I&#39;m not getting full performance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aj531",

I discovered this while trying to fix racemenu exiting when closing the virtual keyboard after opening it again to close the console. After further testing I discovered that the baae game itself, unmodded crashes upon clicking Tab. Furthermore this doesn&#39;t happen with 1.6.640. So I&#39;m suspecting the Skyrim update changing the input window when naming the character or the anniversary upgrade are at fault.</p> <p>What other limux related causes could cause this? If indeed the base game is broken for apparently me only, I do not know what I can do/try to fix this. Is this already a known issue? Are there already fixes for this?</p> <p>Any suggestions? Perhaps anything to make the game think it is not on the Steam Deck and therefore possibly not cause these issues?",

I know AMD is the preferred platform for Linux, and I know of all of the issues surrounding pricing a specific issue with 5090s, particularly the Founders Edition. But there&#39;s ton of discussion of them in the gen pop PC gaming world. However, the 9070/9070 XT apparently has been a huge hit for AMD, and there&#39;s a lot more discussion of those here it seems to me. </p> <p>But I thought I would have heard something more on DLSS 4 and possibly MFG which kinda seems to be working on Linux? Just curious if the 5000s just have just no appeal to Linux folks because of pricing, availability, bugs, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/heatlesssun\"> /u/heatlesssun </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jjzyzc/whats_the_general_state_of_rt",

When I play, I usually use a controller (the Gamesir Tarantula Pro) and so far, I absolutely love it.</p> <p>The reason I&#39;m making this post is that, ever since I got this controller, I feel like it&#39;s missing one key feature for PC gaming: a trackpad or touchpad. I&#39;ve seen videos of Linux/Steam Deck users arguing that PS4 and PS5 controllers are the best mainly because of their trackpad. And while I love my Gamesir, I want to try a controller with that feature.</p> <p>Do you know of any controller that has a trackpad/touchpad and similar features to the Gamesir Tarantula Pro (like Hall-effect triggers and joysticks, as well as clicky buttons)?</p> <p>Or do you think I should just stick with the controller I have now?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/William_488",
