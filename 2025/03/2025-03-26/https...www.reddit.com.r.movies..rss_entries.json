Okay, imagine if, rather than an animated film about animals, <em>Flow</em> (2024) was a live-action film about androids. Now make it co-directed by Michel Gondry and Darren Aronofsky and give it a steampunk aesthetic. That&#39;s <em>Myth of Man</em>. But this description does not do this beautiful film justice. I believe that Jamin Winans&#39; <em>Myth of Man</em> represents the reason that human beings still make movies -- the hope and possibility that we might still capture a truly unique and mesmerizing vision on film. And <em>Myth of Man</em> is <em>truly</em> mesmerizing.

I prefer something that really doesn\u2019t let up and wants you to feel as miserable and scared as the characters do. </p> <p>Basically the same atmosphere of the basement scene in Zodiac, but for 90 minutes straight.

I was absolutely blown away by the visuals as well as the acting by the main character Rohan Chand (at just 14 years old). I was shocked to find out it was made in 2018, I feel like the visuals are above and beyond much of what I see from movies made today in 2025. And while the main character is a very young actor, he stays in character amazingly well and his facial expressions and delivery of his (sparing) lines is a above and beyond what I&#39;d ever normally expect from an actor that age. </p> <p>Of course there was massive departure from the &quot;original&quot; story, but that didn&#39;t bother me at all, it&#39;s its own story and adaptation and I felt they pulled it off masterfully. </p> <p>The only thing I can assume from reading the prevalence of bad reviews is that people are pissed that it didn&#39;t do justice to their nostalgia for the &quot;origina",
