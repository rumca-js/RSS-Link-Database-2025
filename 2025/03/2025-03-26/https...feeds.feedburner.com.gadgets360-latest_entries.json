        "description": "New research from the DESI project suggests that dark energy, once thought to be a constant force, may actually be changing over time. This challenges long-held cosmological models that assume a stable influence of dark energy on the universe\u2019s expansion. By mapping 15 million galaxies, DESI\u2019s data raises new questions about cosmic evolution. Scientists are now re-evaluating whether the standard model can still fully explain the universe\u2019s rapid expansion. Further research is expected to provide a clearer understanding of dark energy\u2019s true role in shaping the cosmos.",

        "description": "Fossilized feathers of a 30,000-year-old vulture, found in volcanic ash near Rome, have been analyzed, revealing a unique preservation process. Unlike typical fossilized feathers, these retained three-dimensional structures, likely due to zeolite minerals formed in the ash. Scientists believe the vulture was buried in a low-temperature pyroclastic deposit, allowing soft tissues to fossilize at a microscopic level. This breakthrough suggests volcanic rocks could hold more fossils than previously thought.",

While these stellar remnants cool over time, their shrinking habitable zones may still allow biological processes like photosynthesis and UV-driven abiogenesis to occur. A model assessing a planet's energy reception over seven billion years indicates that life-sustaining conditions could persist. These findings suggest white dwarf systems should be reconsidered in the search for extraterrestrial life, potentially guiding future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.",
