I&#39;m curious to know if it&#39;s possible to create a file or image that embeds a location tracker maybe in its metadata, which requests the user&#39;s location and sends it to a server (such as a local machine). If this is feasible, what methods could be used to achieve it? If anyone is interested in discussing this, please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arpitkumar12809\"> /u/Arpitkumar12809 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1jkm0m2/curious_about_digital_forensics/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1jkm0m2/curious_about_digital_forensics/\">[comments]</a></span>",
