Meta, Steam, Reddit, Discord, Twitter other socials also deleted a few social accounts either because I couldn&#39;t change the e-mail address or it was a lengthy process. Since I&#39;m an avid gamer I also had to unlink my account from games and now I&#39;m waiting for a game&#39;s customer support to unlink it so I can finally be done with it. After I delete my account my Google play games data will also be deleted.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done almost everything with this single account.
