Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 5090 is at its best when paired with a 4K monitor that can reach high refresh rates, like 144 Hz or 240 Hz. Anything less than that diminishes the value of an already ridiculously expensive card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A graphics card as beefy as the RTX 5090 needs to chew on the toughest games to justify its $1,999 price tag.
