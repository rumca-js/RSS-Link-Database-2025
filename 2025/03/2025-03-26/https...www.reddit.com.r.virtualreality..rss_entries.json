Like, actual predicted trajectories in real time.</p> <p>Even cooler \u2014 you can slightly adjust the aim using hand buttons and immediately see how the new path plays out. It\u2019s like having a real coach whispering your next best move before every shot.</p> <p>I\u2019m not even good at pool, but with this on, I cleared more shots than I ever have. It visualizes not just your cue ball, but the target ball\u2019s future path too \u2014 including rebounds.

Whether it\u2019s for gaming, work, or anything else, a normal setup can do the job better without all the extra hassle. The hardware is expensive, and on top of that, you still have to wear a VR headset. Sure, headsets are improving, but they still have a lot of problems. After a while, your eyes start to feel irritated, motion sickness kicks in, and overall, it just gets uncomfortable. At that point, why not just use a regular screen? AR sounds futuristic, but in reality, it just doesn\u2019t offer enough benefits to make it worth all the downsides.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Original-Code3210\"> /u/Original-Code3210 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jkgii2/is_it_just_me_who_thinks_ar_is_kind_of_dumb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"",

The network part works fine (wifi 7 6ghz) but i still experience some annoying microstuttering. i would love the 5800x3d but cant find one anywhere. Has anyone done a similar upgrade? All tips and advice are welcome. It kust sounds like reducing the clock speed is never an upgrade, but PCVR benefits a lot from the extra cache?
