First 30 days are free and 20% off the annual premium subscription when you use our link \u279c  https://brilliant.org/sabine. \n\nResearchers from the U.K. have created a new prototype battery made out of nuclear waste by turning the irradiated graphite shielding of nuclear reactor cores into crystals. The new batteries, according to the researchers, will produce energy for up to 5,000 years.
