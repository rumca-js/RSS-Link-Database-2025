        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nNaughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet doesn't have an official release date, but according to Bloomberg, the game may not make it out until 2027 at the earliest. That would make it seven years into the life of the PlayStation 5, and there's a good chance Sony will have already announced the PS6. Could Intergalactic be withheld from the current-gen PS5 and be a launch title for the PS6? And would that mean Naughty Dog has missed the PS5 generation entirely, outside of remakes and remasters? Speaking of release dates, CD Projekt has confirmed that the upcoming The Witcher 4 will not be released earlier by the end of 2026, which means another 2027 release date at the earliest. And finally, Nintendo has one last Direct aimed specifically at the Switch 1, a week before the big Switch 2 reveal in April. We may finally get the deep dive on Metroid Prime 4 that we've been waiting for.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5",

        "description": "AI Limit reviewed by Travis Northup on PlayStation 5, also available on PC.\n\nAI Limit is a soulslike without any soul, providing 30 mediocre hours of dodge rolling and sword swinging that\u2019s good for little more than filling time. I sliced my way through repetitive goons in unremarkable locations, killed some pushover bosses who were dead before I thought to learn their names, and spent more time recovering from game crashes than learning anything noteworthy about the bland sci-fi setting or the characters within it. The stylish art style, smart Sync Rate system, and swappable abilities are interesting tweaks to the blueprint, but are ultimately too minor to leave much of an impression. If you\u2019re really hurting for more opportunities to scratch that soulslike itch, you could probably do worse than AI Limit, but you could also easily do a whole lot better.",

        "description": "Wreckfest 2 Early Access reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC.\n\n\"As a huge fan of developer Bugbear since the original FlatOut in 2004, Wreckfest 2 is definitely already speaking my language \u2013 and it really does feel great when you\u2019re in the thick of it, crashing and carving your way through rival cars and destructible scenery on a scale I\u2019ve never seen before. The slim amount of content and abundant crashes to desktop in the early access launch, however, make Wreckfest 2 in its current form more of an investment in what\u2019s to come than an imperative you should change course to experience today. It leaves a mark on first impact, but a few sessions later and I feel like I\u2019ve squeezed all the fun I\u2019m going to glean out of it for now.\"",
