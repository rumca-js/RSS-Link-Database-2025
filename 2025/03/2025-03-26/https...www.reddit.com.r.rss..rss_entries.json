I&#39;m not sure how they do this, maybe just web scraping? </p> <p>I made a free account and notice that they allow you to export an OPML of your followings which are all in this format:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://rss2.feedspot.com/https://www.SITE.com/?context=NUMBER\">https://rss2.feedspot.com/https://www.SITE.com/?context=NUMBER</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Yet none of these are valid feeds and return &quot;not authorized&quot; pages which makes me think this is really just to import/export among Feedspot only. </p> <p>Is there any way of following these in a 3rd party reader? Or even of seeing how they are following these sites to maybe get a hint about how it could be done outside Feedspot?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chickenandlive",
