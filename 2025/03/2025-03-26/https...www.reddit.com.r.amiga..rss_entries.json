Back when I had the A500 I could copy games fairly well as an 8 year old, even managing to wangle changes so they worked between the 500 and the 500+ but no longer. </p> <p>Anyway, I have recently been using computer games as a way of zoning out after work but would like to go back to my old adventure games from the A500. I had Dizzy, Fire &amp; Ice, Bubble Bobble, The Simpsons and a variety of others i would love to try and find and play again. </p> <p>I&#39;m on a Windows PC with windows 11, can anyone help me get started with any of the above?
