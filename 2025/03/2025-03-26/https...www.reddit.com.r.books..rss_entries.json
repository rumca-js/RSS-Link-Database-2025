There were moments of pure delight, and then there were moments where my 21st-century brain begged for a fast-forward button. It took me two weeks to finish (which, given the amount of tea-drinking and letter-writing in this book, feels appropriate).</p> <p>Then came the <strong>2005 novel adaptation</strong>, and wow. The very next day, I watched it, and let me tell you\u2014it was a masterpiece. For a beginner like me, it smoothed out the more tedious parts of the novel while keeping the heart of the story intact. The cinematography? Stunning. The tension between Lizzy and Darcy? Palpable.

Just an observation but I feel like libraries aren\u2019t really about reading anymore. As someone who loves books and borrows more from the library than I own, I always hope to see people reading more. But many times when I go, I notice that most people are working, on their laptops or using their phones rather than actually reading books. For 1 time, I sat near the librarian\u2019s desk for about two hours and I didn\u2019t see anyone borrowing books from that counter. Maybe it just wasn\u2019t a busy time for the library IDK.</p> <p>I get that libraries have changed and that they\u2019re also study or work spaces now (like co working space), which is totally fine. But I kind of miss the vibe of people actually reading books.
