I work in video, and have built these sites to support my projects or my clients. These arent major sites at all and most only have 5-10 pages max and minimal traffic. That brings me to my SEO question. Thinking about how to get more back links to my site and hearing that links in the footer of other sites are less weighted by Google than links in the body of a page. So rather than just put a footer that says &#39;site built by x&#39;, what if I were to make a page and write a few paragraphs (keyword heavy) about my company and include a link back to my site. I would include this page on the sitemap.xml file, but exclude it from visitor facing navigation all together. Would Google spider this page, would it register as a valuable back link, or is this a bad idea for some other reason?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
