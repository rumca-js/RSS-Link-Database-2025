I attempted to investigate the site in my virtual machine, but it appears that there\u2019s an anti-debug script running on the site that detects if I\u2019m in a virtual machine. How can I proceed with my investigation and use my virtual machine to check further? Is there a way to bypass this anti-debugging script that the attack has installed using a tool or extension?</p> <p>Secondly, to whom should I report this? I tried using Whois, but all the records have been redacted, and I don\u2019t want to contact them via phone. I would prefer to anonymously report this incident if possible. This incident is taking place in Canada. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Mousse989\"> /u/No-Mousse989 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j",

The role involves working with the senior compliance officer using Vanta to monitor security risks.</p> <p>Does this internship align with my finance background, or is it too far off? Also, for my internship report, I need to link the internship to my degree.
