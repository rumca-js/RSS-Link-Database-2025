Jay shows us how he's testing GPUs, CPUs, and asks for some advice on setting up new testing methods (that he deployed for the 50-series and that we'll show in the next part of this series). Also, he recently restarted #RIPGN, which means #RIPJAY must return!\n\nWatch our tour of Jay's old office here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=XlfEJwhiMI4\nCheck out Jay's channel! https://www.youtube.com/jayztwocents\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
