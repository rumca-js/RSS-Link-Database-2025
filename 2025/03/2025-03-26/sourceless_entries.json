Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) scientists of the Leiden Observatory (the Netherlands) looked at 73 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus region. They found that many young stars host modest disks of gas and dust, some as small as 1.2 astronomical units. The research, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, establishes an important link between observed protoplanetary disks and exoplanets.",
