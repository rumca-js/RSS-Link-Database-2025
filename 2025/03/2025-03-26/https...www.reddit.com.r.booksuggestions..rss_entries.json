I want reading to be fun and not to feel like I have to &quot;work&quot; but I also want books that will empower me knowledge wise too. are you guys good at buying books that you like? do you have any skills that maybe I can learn to adopt to help me better ",

My recent favs are Outlander (mostly romance but some time travel), and the Southern Vampire Mysteries (regular old earth but with vampire, werewolves, and more). I like a coming together and staying together story. I like a story that is easy to fall into (that\u2019s why I tend to read books I\u2019ve seen movies or TV shows about). I like series, but would prefer if the series is complete and has audio books.</p> <p>So, what would you recommend?

I have read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot;, both by King or, better, by Bachman. I absolutely loved these books because they were not too long and had a continuous flow that got me immediately hooked. For example, in &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, the book describes this walk from start to finish, without ever leaving a single second of the action. In &quot;The Running Man&quot;, the same thing happens. One single objective, one single protagonist, from start to finish, never leaving them.
