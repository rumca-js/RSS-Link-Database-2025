I want to share my experience with Linux desktop after attempted switch. Preconditions: I have fairly modern PC, Linux desktop experience from 7-10 years ago, and light, but up-to-date server Linux experience. I didn&#39;t made notes in the process, so I may confuse some details.</p> <p>I wanted to try something fairly common and well supported, minimal hassle, with UI experience similar to Windows, and High DPI support. What I tried:</p> <p>Latest Linux Mint with Cinnamon. It works, it looks good, built-in UI tools are appreciated. Almost no need for terminal. Issues from deal beakers to minor:</p> <ul> <li>4k240Hz does not work - only up to 120Hz (!).</li> <li>Firefox tabs are not at the top of the screen for some reason, i.e. I can&#39;t change tab without precision pointing in 2 axis. Flathub version styled fine in that regard.</li> <li>Some ap

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Potential unpopular opinion</p> <p>I&#39;ve been a Linux user for a long time—10 years this month. I started with Ubuntu, but that lasted less than a month. While the UI made sense and everything was &quot;where it should be&quot; coming from Windows, I quickly realized I wasn&#39;t learning how Linux was different, how it worked, or how to leverage its advantages.</p> <p>So, I started exploring the internet and came across Arch Linux—NOT FOR NOOBS. The hype about it being too advanced or a pain to install and maintain actually attracted me. I tend to approach learning new things by getting my hands dirty. If I wanted to understand how an internal combustion engine worked, I&#39;d take one apart, put it back together, inspect unfamiliar parts, and figure out what does what.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been on Arch ever since, with a few brief stints in Fedora, Gentoo, and one long, winding road with LFS.</p> <p>If you&#39;re just looking for an operating system
