I’ve written my fair share of papers in university and I’m a copy editor for our student paper as well. </p> <p>When fact checking, I noticed that Google often recommended unreliable scholarly sources(Medium articles, Reddit comments, and Linkedin posts) first. For example, when you search for Transformers, the first 6 results are blogs and articles. It is only on the seventh that you get the Vaswani 2017 paper. This makes fact checking and source gathering very tedious and time consuming.</p> <p>I realized a lot of the repetitive work done in fact checking and source collection could be solved using a vector database and a retrieval model, which inspired me to create Scholium, an AI research agent that recommends and summarizes papers based on your query.

The same concept is used for searching, so if you’re looking for a company that matches your specific criteria, the pie chart helps narrow down the options.</p> <p>The platform also has a community aspect—you earn points through your engagement, which influences search results and even boosts your visibility.
