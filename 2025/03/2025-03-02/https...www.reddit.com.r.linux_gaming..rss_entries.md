## Controller input works fine in games, but not in web browsers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I own a GameSir Nova Lite controller. On Windows, it works as expected in web browsers. However, on Linux, both Firefox and Chromium don&#39;t handle the input correctly, and each behaves differently. The controller works fine in games, though, and the other controller I tried, the DualShock 4, works correctly in web browsers.</p> <p>Is it possible that on Linux, each app is responsible for handling controller input separately, while Wine handles the input for all apps running under it? Could this be why the less common controller doesn&#39;t work properly in browsers (niche controller support on Linux is not a priority for web browsers)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/habitee"> /u/habitee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j23gbl/controller_input_works_fine_in_games_but_not_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/c

## Valve's proton and Steam Deck are not enough!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Valve&#39;s translation layer has been around for 6 years and Steam Deck has been out for 3 years. And yet Valve&#39;s statistics show that Linux usage has increased to only 2% or 2.4% at best. This is very very low. I have recently read an article that said Valve sold 4 000 000 units which is ok but it&#39;s not enough to push the needle further.</p> <p>If we want to have software support on par with Windows we need at least 15% or 20% Linux usage. I just don&#39;t know how to get there. Gnu/Linux needs to be pre-installed on computers in order for people to use it. Majority of people do not re-install operating systems nor do they care about it. System76, Tuxedo and Slimbook do sell laptops with the penguin pre-installed but people who are outside the FOSS circle don&#39;t even know these companies exist. If Dell, HP and Lenovo started selling their laptops with the penguin that would greatly boost the numbers but they have no desire to do that.</p

Well, speaking from my experience with gaming on Linux i often stumbled into issues with games and my first thought was: &quot;that&#39;s definitely something wrong with my Linux distribution or mesa driver&quot; I&#39;ve never thought about game developers, who created this game and does not make it playable on Linux. They don&#39;t even thought about it, because the game itself hasn&#39;t got Linux native version or even Steam Deck compatibility. And those GPU related issues is often reveals as results on using undocumented API functions, or just bad coding practices. Those issues is mainly fixed by workarounds in mesa driver or DXVK, Wine, Proton etc. but not in the game itself, because &quot;if it&#39;s somehow working on windows withou
