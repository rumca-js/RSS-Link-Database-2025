I searched here and read through podcast recommendations and I like retro hour and retronauts but they\u2019re just too long. I don\u2019t have that kind of time. Anyone got any recommendations for 20-30 minute podcasts focused on news and new releases? I appreciate interviews and deep dives but I just want to be made aware of developments and then deep dive into things that might catch my interest versus trying to wade through hours long episodes. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sychox51\"> /u/sychox51 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j20xci/brief_news_podcasts/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j20xci/brief_news_podcasts/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It was on Windows. </p> <p>There&#39;s a tall and slim man in the game and somewhat like a checked square where he has to walk on and collect coins across horizontallyand vertically. Then there&#39;s another level the coins are somewhat like jelly (some sponge thing). The man walks very slowly to collect the coins and once he&#39;s done there is a reward that appears and once he collects it he moves to another level.</p> <p>The platform is seen from above and the colours I remember were somewhat blue for the floor he walks on and also his clothes. </p> <p>I got this game from a CD of mixed game (CD 300 jeux) in year 2003 and the game might be from early 2000. </p> <p>I cannot remember the name at all.
