However, since I&#39;m developing it in my free time alongside university, I often think about how to cover expenses like bills. Given the costs associated with maintaining a mobile app, even a passion project like this, I plan to incorporate donations as a way to help cover expenses. I believe this is a good approach that avoids putting features behind a paywall, maintaining the app&#39;s accessibility for all users.</p> <p>As this is would be my first open-source project, I&#39;m also thinking about how to grow a community around the app and, in the future, my projects in general.

I&#39;ve always been interested in trading and always wanted to work on creating my own trading project. I had background in ML, so I decided to do was utilize this in trading. You might be wondering why I decided to make this open source. There&#39;s potentially a lot to lose, but I would beg to differ.</p> <p>There&#39;s a moral aspect behind it as well as something I want to gain. From the moral standpoint, when I was in uni and wanted to code my first automated trading bot, I remembered there was practically no publicly available trading bot. It was mostly trading gurus promoting their classes or their channel. This was something I promised myself many years ago if I do create a successful trading bot I will open source it so other people can potentially use my project to create better trained models or projects. Another thing is opportunity. I was able to learn a lot from critique. I had one o",

Each module is essentially packaged intelligence that other users can reuse, similar to libraries but more sophisticated. The goal is to let people build complex systems that can handle parts of any org via agents without starting from scratch every time.</p> <p>I&#39;ve built smaller projects before that got some attention, but nothing this ambitious.
