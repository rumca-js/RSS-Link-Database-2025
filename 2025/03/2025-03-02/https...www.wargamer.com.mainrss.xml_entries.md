								<p>What if there had been a <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> videogame on the 1998 Gameboy Color handheld console? Well, it might have looked a little bit like ‘Imperium Strike Force’, a fan-created indie game inspired by both the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, and the retro shooter Mercenary Force.</p>
