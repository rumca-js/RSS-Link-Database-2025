I forgot its name and remember only a few plot points. The protagonist was female, she joined the army and was personally mentored by a general named &quot;black&quot;. I think there were 7 generals in total. She gained renown in the army and got her own unit. She had a sidekick that was a goblin and a sapper. I think she gained powers correlating to Ice later on. The main antagonist was living in a desert inside of a big black spire with plotting nobles. </p> <p>Even ChatGPT couldn&#39;t help me, so I know my description is a bit vague.

I arrived to the ending fully feeling the weight of the journey, the increasing complexity of the worldbuilding and the increasing epicness of the plot, and it was almost alienating to think back to the first chapters once I had seen how much had changed in just 1100 pages (I guess that is another thing I had forgotten: it is a relatively short book for all it contains, but it manages to be utterly epic without bloating the pages). </p> <p>I still think that what makes it so amazing is not only the story, characters, worldbuilding or even how influential it is, but the message.

It was published by Subterranean Press at the end of January and is just around 100 pages long, so perhaps a novelette in length.</p> <p>The story focuses on a new protagonist, the disgraced former history scholar second-class Ulcetha, who has taken up writing false provenances for fake artifacts for an unscrupulous dealer after he was falsely accused of stealing an important relic from the university five years ago. When his only close friend is killed in an airship crash--the same crash that propels forward the change in reign in The Goblin Emperor--he receives a puzzling missive from the friend&#39;s wife, leading him on a journey to unravel its mystery.</p> <p>The Orb of Cairado is filled with the same kind of cozy satisfaction (and almost as many long names) that endeared me to The Goblin Emperor and the Cemeteries of Amalo books.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys. I&#39;m looking for recommendations for a high fantasy novel or series with a major focus on complex world building, politics, international power dynamics, and realistic levels of technicality in its mechanics. The more creative the setting the better, and non-human races and nations in the mix are a huge bonus.</p> <p>I honestly haven&#39;t found a book that satisfies this itch yet so I don&#39;t have anything to present as a point of comparison. Imagine asoif but only the small council meetings. Or more niche, if anyone&#39;s read the Overlord series, then something similar to that (only in terms of world building).</p> <p>I&#39;d prefer a mature multiwork series, but I&#39;ll take any recommendations regardless.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMisterMan666\"> /u/TheMisterMan666 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j1f07y/high_fantasy_with_overwhelmin",

I&#39;ve recently decided to get back into reading after having been on quite a long break, and I could use some help finding my next read. As the title states, I&#39;m looking for a high/epic fantasy book and/or series with some romance that is well done, but doesn&#39;t take away from the main plot. The last series I both read and loved is Eragon. I thank anyone who helps me with this endeavor.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Will_Da_Bill\"> /u/Will_Da_Bill </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j1eu59/looking_for_highepic_fantasy_recommendations_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j1eu59/looking_for_highepic_fantasy_recommendations_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",
