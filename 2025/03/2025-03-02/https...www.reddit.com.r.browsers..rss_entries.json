People are either switching to Chromium or jumping to Firefox forks, and we all know it Firefox is the only real competitor left to Google\u2019s monopoly. I\u2019m not saying Mozilla&#39;s a saint, but they need revenue to keep Firefox free somehow. They\u2019ve been transparent about how they do it, and the changes are opt-out, not forced. Plus, Firefox is open-source. If something shady was happening, we\u2019d know. Another thing the market share for Firefox is already at an all-time low, and spreading hysteria isn\u2019t helping. If you\u2019re upset, at least read the TOS and privacy policy. Mozilla\u2019s doing its best to stay competitive, and all this drama is just making it harder. So yeah, i know Mozilla kinda messed up but really it is still the only real alternative to Google(Chromium).
