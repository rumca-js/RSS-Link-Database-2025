<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This hate towards Firefox is getting out of hand. People are either switching to Chromium or jumping to Firefox forks, and we all know it Firefox is the only real competitor left to Google’s monopoly. I’m not saying Mozilla&#39;s a saint, but they need revenue to keep Firefox free somehow. They’ve been transparent about how they do it, and the changes are opt-out, not forced. Plus, Firefox is open-source. If something shady was happening, we’d know. Another thing the market share for Firefox is already at an all-time low, and spreading hysteria isn’t helping. If you’re upset, at least read the TOS and privacy policy. Mozilla’s doing its best to stay competitive, and all this drama is just making it harder. So yeah, i know Mozilla kinda messed up but really it is still the only real alternative to Google(Chromium). Let’s keep it real and stop the unnecessary backlash.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/us

Idk maybe I&#39;m crazy or something but I really see this.
