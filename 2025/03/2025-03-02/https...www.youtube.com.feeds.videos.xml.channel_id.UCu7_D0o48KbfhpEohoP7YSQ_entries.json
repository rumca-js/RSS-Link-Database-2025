        "description": "Time nuts are people deeply interested in exact timekeeping. They usually use atomic clocks to get to this holy grail. In today\u2019s video, we will get precise time without internet access or a personal atomic clock. Instead, we will use 5-10 dollar GPS receivers. Fortunately, the atomic clocks we will use are paid for by other people.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nGPS Dongle: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oD7tl70\nGPS receiver I used: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oCavrdy\nState-of-the-art GPS receivers: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oEkO9Kq\n\nWriteup: https://github.com/SensorsIot/NTP-Server-with-GPS\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/",
