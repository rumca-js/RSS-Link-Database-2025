        "description": "<p><span>\n\nI realized I've been eating oranges wrong for years.  I cut them into\nslices and eat them slice by slice.  Which is fine, except that I'm\nwasting the zest.  Zest is tasty, versatile, compact, and freezes\nwell.  So now, whenever I eat a navel orange I zest it first:\n\n</span>\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/orange-zest-container-big.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/orange-zest-container.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"532\" class=\"mobile-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:100.0vw; max-height:96.7vw;\" srcset=\"https://www.jefftk.com/orange-zest-container.jpg 550w,https://www.jefftk.com/orange-zest-container-2x.jpg 1100w\"><div style=\"height:min(96.7vw, 532px)\" class=\"image-vertical-spacer\"></div></a>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe zest goes in a small container in the freezer, and is available\nfor cooking and baking as needed.  Probably my favorite thing to do\nwith it right now is steep it in cream (~3-15g per cup, bring to near\nboil, leave for 20min, filter) and then use the cream for all sorts ",
