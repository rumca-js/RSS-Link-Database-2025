Here&#39;s why:</p> <p>Interpreter required: Python needs an interpreter, making it harder to execute on target machines.</p> <p>Large file size: Python files are often bulky, making them easier to detect.</p> <p>Easy to reverse engineer: Python&#39;s simplicity makes it simple to analyze and understand, making it harder to hide malicious code.</p> <p>Compiled languages like C or C++ are faster, stealthier, and better suited for low-level system exploits.
