I&#39;m using C++ with multithreading to maximize packet throughput. Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening under the hood: First, I create a packet pool of 1024 pre-initialized DHCP discovery packets to avoid constant reallocation. Each packet gets a randomized MAC address (starting with 52:54:00 prefix) and transaction ID. The real thing happens in the multithreaded approach, I spawn twice as many threads as CPU cores, with each thread sending a continuous stream of DHCP discover packets via UDP broadcast.</p> <p>Every 1000 packets, the code refreshes the MAC address and transaction ID to ensure variety.
