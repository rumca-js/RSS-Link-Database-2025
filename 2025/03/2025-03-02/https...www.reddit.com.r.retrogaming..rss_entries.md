<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. There&#39;s an old pc game I used to play around year 2003-2006. It was on Windows. </p> <p>There&#39;s a tall and slim man in the game and somewhat like a checked square where he has to walk on and collect coins across horizontallyand vertically. Then there&#39;s another level the coins are somewhat like jelly (some sponge thing). The man walks very slowly to collect the coins and once he&#39;s done there is a reward that appears and once he collects it he moves to another level.</p> <p>The platform is seen from above and the colours I remember were somewhat blue for the floor he walks on and also his clothes. </p> <p>I got this game from a CD of mixed game (CD 300 jeux) in year 2003 and the game might be from early 2000. </p> <p>I cannot remember the name at all.

The display is active, so there is a signal, but the display remains black. The OSD menu shows up perfectly fine.</p> <p>RGB: Without the adapter I get the image on my display using the LRY ports, but it looks like a PAL Signal on an NTSC screen - grey and not in sync.</p> <p>I tried forcing PAL to NTSC, upscale options, disabled maximum height but nothing has any impact on either interface.</p> <p>GBS-C also disconnects from the Wifi as soon as the display signal connects which makes testing different settings a real pain.</p> <p>Fun fact: When having SCART connected and I move the switch right to the SCART from the middle to the right position, I can see the image for a short moment, but tinted in green.</p> <p>Anyway, I am thankful for any hint - spo thanks in adva

## so I used to have a game gear but I have lost it and if I do have it I probably lost the parts since I moved a few times and was in the middle of fixing it. and I was wondering if they ever made a clone of it like they have for game boys.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>basically the title I want basically a game gear clone either same size little bit smaller don&#39;t make a difference. I mostly just wanted to play game gear games maybe Sega or Nintendo depending how mapping works since buttons are obviously limited. I have thought about picking up a new one but the prices are $200 something to 30 for maybe working and I don&#39;t know if 200s worth it. just curious if there&#39;s anything like that out there that&#39;s popularity of retro has increased. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/detectivelokifalcone"> /u/detectivelokifalcone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j1ji5q/so_i_used_to_have_a_game_gear_but_i_have_lost_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j1ji5q/so_i_used_to_have_a_game_gear_but_i_have_lost_it/">[comments]</a></span>
