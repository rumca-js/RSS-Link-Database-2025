<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just read this contemporary gothic novel, a tale of dark obsessions, art, and secrets. Parts of the tales are narrated from the point of view of Frenchman who becomes obsessed with, grooms and abducts a fifteen year-old girl, then passes her off as his daughter-well aware yet in denial that he is in Humbert Humbert territory. The two become part of small close knit group of art world eccentrics, many of who likewise become obsessed with the young woman. These people are all bound by secrets they are keeping from each other and when a cache of nude paintings of the woman is discovered, it sets in motion an unravelling of secrets that lead to murder. Well-paced, well-written and suspenseful, this a compelling story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/econoquist"> /u/econoquist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j21zjk/in_malice_quite_close_by_brandi_lynn_ryder/">[link

## Hyper, the debut novel by Agri Ismaïl, a Swedish-Kurdish lawyer, was written in two iterations, in Swedish and English: "It was a give-and-take: Swedish blesses you with lots of interesting compound words, and English blesses you with a variety of sentence structures."

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&gt;!Just read &#39;The Usborne Princess Handbook&#39; by Susanne at the library today and I’m curious like how did everyone else interpret it?</p> <p>At first glance, it’s this guide full of rules about kissing frogs, staying at the top of the tower, finding princes to wake you from slumber, and all the royal etiquette etc. But the more I read, the more I felt like the whole thing was written with a tongue in cheek (more of sarcastic tone) like the author was low key making fun of those outdated, old fashioned princess clichés in a creative way.</p> <p>But now I’m wondering... was it actually meant to be taken seriously and I just found humor where there wasn’t any? Or did anyone else pick up on that playful satire vibe or was it meant to be taken literally!&lt;</p> <p>Would love to know how others interpret it, cute &amp; funny or totally outdated &amp; offensive?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/use

While the plot is interesting and the characters are good enough, the style is getting irritating. </p> <p>The way it’s written really just highlights how it’s one guy writing. The characters speak with the same voice, use all the same gimmicks. </p> <p>And worse, the gimmicks are shared from characters to narrator, even when focusing on different characters. </p> <p>Let me explain because wow that’s confusing ! </p> <p>The narrator will go on a tirade talking about the Whitemen and the Brown to make reference to a race war. That’s cool the first time but then why use those words in a new chapter on another character ?
