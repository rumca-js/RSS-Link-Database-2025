[...]</p>\n\n<p>Analysis and Conclusions:</p>\n\n<p>iPhone 16 series first-weekend pre-order sales are estimated at\nabout 37 million units, down about 12.7% YoY from last year\u2019s\niPhone 15 series first-weekend sales. The key factor is the\nlower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that pre-orders for the iPhone 16 lineup only started two days prior, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/get-ready-to-upgrade-to-the-new-iphone-16-apple-watch-and-airpods-lineups/\">on Friday September 13</a>. Here were Kuo\u2019s estimates for first-weekend pre-order sales, compared year-over-year to the equivalent iPhone 15 models:</p>\n\n<p><tabl",
