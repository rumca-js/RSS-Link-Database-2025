I can pay more attention and understand it, but then there&#39;s still the issue of retaining all that information. What would be the point of all this effort? I just need to know what I should do. Focus on key points. If he said anything important, I couldn&#39;t tell. I zoned out from all the chemistry. </p> <p>Maybe if you have a keen interest in chemistry, you would find this book very interesting. I just have a keen interest in knowing how to increase my chances of living longer.

I read about so many things, romance, billionaire romance, werewolf, vampire, monster name it. I think I&#39;ve read most of the genres. I love reading but I guess when college rolled in I got so busy that reading was something so hard to do for me, my entertainment became just an hour of movies or series. Because at least it&#39;s not a long term commitment I&#39;m making. And I guess I lost the same passion I&#39;ve had in needing to read something, it&#39;s been 5 years, and I really want to get back at it.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Reddit! Repost from another subreddit. My friend (f25) was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis when she was three. Today, we went to a book warehouse, and I noticed she picked up a book that I didn\u2019t see the title of. I excitedly asked her what she got, saw the title was \u201cLiving with Chronic Pain,\u201d and dropped my excitement to say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s sad.\u201d We had a big laugh about the contrast between my excitement and the book\u2019s topic. Then she said she\u2019s been looking for a book that\u2019s about rheumatoid arthritis, but she\u2019s only found rheumatoid arthritis books for older people. She hasn\u2019t found any books for people written her age.</p> <p>I did see a handful online that miiiiiiight fit that description, but since I haven\u2019t read them, I\u2019m not sure and don\u2019t want to buy it in case it\u2019s not what she wants. Does anyone have suggestions? Even a book that talks about arthritis without mentioning age would make her happy. Let me know!</p> </div><!-",
