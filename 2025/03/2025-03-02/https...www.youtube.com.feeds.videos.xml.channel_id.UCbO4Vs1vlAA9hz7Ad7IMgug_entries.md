Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. 

We're back with Chris from Lords of War to answer his questions about what can Independent and Small Print publishers do to get their products stocked more often in Local Game Stores?
