But what makes some thrive and some sank, is the mentality</p> <p>It&#39;s hard to talk about success and rich when you need to feed yourself and have a shelter. I completely agree. And that is why I think it is essentially the game of patience, perseverance, and trial and error... And then some luck</p> <p>The patience to wait until you&#39;re done with your day job. The perseverance to keep doing it over and over again without stopping, like a routine habit. The trial and error of being frustrated, talking to the rubber duck, learning what you did right, what you did wrong, and keep going</p> <p>Then, luck will be on your side</p> <p>It&#39;s that about everything in life. Which gets frustrating from times. The key is to never give up what you believed for, nor to be self-absorbed by frustration.
