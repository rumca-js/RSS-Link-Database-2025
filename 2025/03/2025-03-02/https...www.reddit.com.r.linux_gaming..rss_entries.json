And yet Valve&#39;s statistics show that Linux usage has increased to only 2% or 2.4% at best. This is very very low. I have recently read an article that said Valve sold 4 000 000 units which is ok but it&#39;s not enough to push the needle further.</p> <p>If we want to have software support on par with Windows we need at least 15% or 20% Linux usage. I just don&#39;t know how to get there. Gnu/Linux needs to be pre-installed on computers in order for people to use it. Majority of people do not re-install operating systems nor do they care about it. System76, Tuxedo and Slimbook do sell laptops with the penguin pre-installed but people who are outside the FOSS circle don&#39;t even know these companies exist. If Dell, HP and Lenovo started selling their laptops with the penguin that would greatly boost the numbers but they have no desire to do that.</p",
