<p>Lenovo is showing business laptops lovers some attention by announcing several new ThinkPads at Mobile World Congress 2025, including a new form factor for the T-series line, and updated internals across the business laptop lineup.</p>
<p>The ThinkPad T14s 2-in-1 is by far the most interesting of the bunch, with a new convertible body that's similar to <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-yoga-slim-9i-is-the-first-laptop-to-get-an-under-display-camera-160045339.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovos-yoga-slim-9i-is-the-first-laptop-to-get-an-under-display-camera-160045339.html">Lenovo's Yoga laptops</a>, and supports the magnetic Yoga Pen stylus. The laptop comes with up to a 14-inch, 400-nit WUXGA touch display, and inside, you can get up to a Intel Core Ultra 7 H or U 200 series chip, 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM and 1TB of storage. If you'r

## Lenovo’s codename Flip is another wild take on a flexible-screen laptop

<p>Lenovo hasn’t even released its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html"><ins>futuristic laptop with a rollable screen</ins></a>. But that hasn’t stopped the company from taking that notebook’s core components and remixing it into a whole new thing at MWC 2025.</p>
<p>Officially called the ThinkBook codename Flip AI PC Proof of concept (yes, that is its official name and it’s a real mouthful), the laptop uses the same flexible OLED featured in its rollable sibling, except this time instead of disappearing inside its chassis, the display folds outwards. This allows what is normally a 13-inch panel to double in size to 18.1 inches at a moment's notice. Notably, because the Flip’s screen bends instead of sliding in and out of the bottom half of the system, Lenovo can utilize the panel’s full area unlike the ThinkBook Rollable, which can only extend up to 16.7 inches.</p>

Lenovo&#39;s Aura edition branding is the result of a partnership with Intel to create a set of &quot;distinct software, hardware and AI features&quot;  that make &quot;computing a more personalized, productive, and protected experience.&quot; The Yoga Pro 9i Aura edition is powered by the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">Intel Core Ultra</a> processor and ships with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, which is the company&#39;s most affordable model in the <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/heres-how-to-buy-a-nvidia-rtx-50-series-gpu-1

<p>You might be surprised to learn that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://solarmuseum.org/cells/samsung-nc215s/">the first laptop with built-in solar panels</a> is nearly 15 years old. But to me, the bigger shock is that with all the recent advancements in photovoltaic cells, manufacturers haven’t revisited this idea more often. But at MWC 2025, Lenovo is changing that with its Yoga Solar PC Concept.</p>
<p>Weighing 2.6 pounds and measuring less than 0.6 inches thick, the Yoga Solar PC Concept is essentially the same size as a standard 14-inch clamshell. And because its underlying design isn’t all that different from Lenovo’s standard Yoga family, it doesn’t skimp on specs either. It features an OLED display, up to 32GB of RAM, a decent-sized 50.2 WHr battery and even a 2MP IR webcam for use with Windows Hello.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, all those components aren’t nearly as important as the solar cells embedded in its lid. Lenovo says the panels us

## Lenovo gave its latest 16-inch ThinkBook a bevy of funky concept screen accessories

<p>The ThinkBook line has sort of become Lenovo’s de facto testing ground for far-out ideas and ambitious concepts. See the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/the-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-is-a-crazy-concept-made-real-162813649.html">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable</a> we saw just a couple months ago at CES. But at MWC 2025, the company is pushing things further than ever through the new ThinkBook 16p Gen 6 and four of its display accessories — which range from practical add-ons to something that’s more like a Tamagotchi.</p>
<p>The ThinkBook 16P powering all of Lenovo’s crazy concept accessories isn’t all that different from the company&#39;s previous 16-inch workstations. It sports up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 2785HX chip with as much as 64GB of RAM, 2TB of PCIe storage and an NVIDIA RTX 5070 GPU. You get the choice of either a 3.2K IPS display with a 165Hz refresh rate or a slightly lower-res 2.5K IPS panel with a faster 240Hz refresh. Th

<p>I love a game that screams things like “neato!” and “godlike!” while I’m feverishly pressing buttons and darting my eyes around the screen, trying to make my fingers work as fast as my brain. My skills in the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-playdate-games-190049201.html">Playdate</a> game <em>XTRIS</em> are definitely <em>not</em> godlike, but there’s just something about that classic arcade announcer voice that makes me think each time, “<em>this</em> is the one where I’ll finally crack the leaderboard.” (It never is).</p>

## The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is a Leica-powered photo showcase

<p>Practically every flagship phone can take a great picture. But that hasn’t stopped Xiaomi from continuing its partnership with legendary camera maker Leica to produce a photo powerhouse in the new Xiaomi 15 Ultra.</p>
<p>Powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, it goes without saying that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has top-notch specs. It also has a huge 6,000 mAh battery, which is bigger than anything you get from Apple, Google or Samsung. Meanwhile, when it comes to charging, wired speeds go up to 90 watts or just a tad slower at 80 watts wirelessly, which is no mean feat. And unlike most phones sold in the US, it comes with a power adapter in the box.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Elsewhere, the 15 Ultra sports a gorgeous 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 1-120Hz refresh rate and up to 3,200 nits of brightness. It’s also available in three colorways: a white model with an etched back, black with an almost rubbery textured finish and a
