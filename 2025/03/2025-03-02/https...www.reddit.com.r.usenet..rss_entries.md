<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all! New to the world of usenet. I’ve got a couple of providers on different backbones but am having very hit-or-miss success with my needs. With the private or invite-only indexers like DS and NC, how frequently do they open/when was the last time they were? Would love to add them to my arsenal at some point ☺️ Also, are they redundant or do they compliment each other well? For context using Geek. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MidnightFades"> /u/MidnightFades </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j1zzdb/usnet_indexers_registration_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j1zzdb/usnet_indexers_registration_question/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Do you have any experience on your ISP contacting you because of your daily downloads?</p> <p>Is that even a thing in Germany? Would also love to hear from people from other countries.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for sharing your experience!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Low_Variety_4009"> /u/Low_Variety_4009 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j1yl00/daily_recommended_download_cap_to_prevent_raising/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j1yl00/daily_recommended_download_cap_to_prevent_raising/">[comments]</a></span>
