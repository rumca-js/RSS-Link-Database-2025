<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I planning to use a Waveshare 3.5 DPI LCD (this one) and I2C I/O expander like TCAL9538 or similar for buttons connected via GPIO to/on my raspberry pi cm4 carrier board. On a LCD wiki there is a pinout but I2C pins of a display don&#39;t line up with those on a raspberry pi. Pin 19 is used as SDA on display but on raspberry pi its a SPI0 MOSI and so on. Any other pin is used by display except 3.3v 35 and 37 pins.</p> <ol> <li><p>Why Waveshare connected I2C touch panel pins to a SPI MOSI and SCLK pins? Is there a posibility that those pins could be used as I2C pins? Like SPI clock as a I2C clock and SPI data input as I2C data input because touch panel only sends data to raspberry pi and dosen&#39;t use any data from raspberry pi so MISO pin is not connected?</p></li> <li><p>When I&#39;m gonna connect I2C expander to a raspberry pi&#39;s I2C1 pins is it gonna work fine with LCD? LCD uses those pins as V-SYNC and H-SYNC but i hope that those pin

## Raspberry PI Zero bare metal tablet (idea)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to make a single-use drawing tablet using an IPS capacitance touch screen. It would be responsive and be a &quot;single use device&quot; like other tablets on the market. I could make free open source plans and also have a version I sell potentially. For both cases, a Raspberry PI zero would be good to keep the cost down. The reason for bare metal is that I want it to be single use, but considering all that is involved, maybe I should just make a shim DE (desktop environment) that loads a Python-based drawing application (and reopens it if it crashes).</p> <p>The reason for making it a single used device is that artists don&#39;t want to fiddle around with an OS, in many cases. I got an Amazon Fire and pressure pen (SonarPen) for an artist, and the free/trial Android drawing apps were too fiddly (too many buttons and options to draw and save and configure pen), and they just ended up using the tablet for Pinterest :(</p> <ul> <li>No-fuss/no-fi

I tired setting ```USB_MSD_PWR_OFF_TIME=0``` but that did not seem to change anything.</p> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PostingPenguin"> /u/PostingPenguin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1j1pajp/how_t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I need some advice on optimizing storage for my Raspberry Pi setup, which I use for home automation, media serving (Jellyfin), DNS and other services.</p> <p>I have several Pi4 and Pi5&#39;s running these services: DNS, FreeRADIUS, HomeAssistant, HomeBridge, Mosquitto (an MQTT broker), various Python/Node.js-based automation scripts and Jellyfin.</p> <p>To extend the lifespan of my pies, I use overlayfs to keep the root partition readonly.
