## Absurd Rick Rubin quote..

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came across the following quote in &quot;Rick Rubin&#39;s The Creative Act:A Way of Being&quot; -</p> <p>&quot;A helpful exercise might be opening a book to a random page and reading the first line your eyes find. See how what&#39;s written there somehow applies to your situation. Any rele-vance it bears might be by chance, but you might allow for the possibility that chance is not all that&#39;s at play. When my appendix burst, the doctor who diagnosed it insisted that I go to the hospital immediately to have it removed. I was told there were no other options. I found myself in a nearby book-store. Standing out on a table in the front was a new book by Dr. Andrew Weil. I picked it up and let it fall open. The first passage my eyes went to said: if a doctor wants to remove a part of your body, and they tell you it has no function, don&#39;t believe this. The information I needed was made available to me in that moment. And I still have my appendix.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you could listen to only one album for the rest of you life, which album do you think has enough variety in its songs that you would choose? I would have to go with Kid A from Radiohead. It&#39;s not as accessible as OK Computer but I think it has so much variety and allows for endless discovery. From the intensity of Idioteque, to the feeling of floating in How To Disappear Completely or the almost ritualistic sound of Everything In it&#39;s Right Place, man this album has got everything. It doesn&#39;t even sound like an album from 2000, which btw is 25 years ago now, (GODDAMN), but ya it feels so fresh even today.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdGlobal3888"> /u/AdGlobal3888 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j1qkrf/one_album_for_life_which_has_enough_variety/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j1qkrf/one_album_f

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Feels like people don’t want to or don’t have the time to listen to albums anymore and bands mostly release singles and EPs. Loving the album Frantic! by Pickap-art, 7 songs in 7 minutes that means I can listen quickly. Wondering if anyone else has really short albums that are proper like ’one sound’ but you can get through quickly. Having a short one makes me want to listen to more albums and less playlists!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Plane_Try_9482"> /u/Plane_Try_9482 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j1pq6t/finding_the_joy_in_albums_again/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j1pq6t/finding_the_joy_in_albums_again/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Under Pressure’ is one of the most iconic collaborations in rock history, blending Queen’s theatrical style with David Bowie’s unique artistry. The bassline is legendary, and the interplay between Freddie and Bowie’s vocals is unforgettable. But I wonder… would it have been as impactful if it had been just one of them rather than a collaboration? Did their creative contrast make the song what it is, or could one of them have pulled off a similar masterpiece alone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MaleficentSecret3397"> /u/MaleficentSecret3397 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j1h61t/under_pressure_queen_ft_david_bowie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j1h61t/under_pressure_queen_ft_david_bowie/">[comments]</a></span>
