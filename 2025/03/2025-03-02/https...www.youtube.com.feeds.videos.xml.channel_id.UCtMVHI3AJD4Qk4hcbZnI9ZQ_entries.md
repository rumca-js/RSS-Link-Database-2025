Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! Sonic Unleashed Is a game that's locked to consoles and out of nowhere, the Sonic community comes with one of the best fan made ports ever seen. This decompilation called "UnleashedRecomp" has everything and it's so impressive that I could see this used to bring back other Xbox 360 games with the sheer effort put in this project. Thanks for watching!
