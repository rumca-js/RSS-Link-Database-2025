<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I expected a straightforward movie about a horrid corner of American history focusing on injustice and racism and the resilience of the human spirit. Movies like that aren’t always bad, but they’re rarely artistically exciting. What I got was something more like Tree of Life, and I mean that as a huge compliment. I thought the story was so much more powerful because of its surrealist qualities. I expected scenery chewing villains and overwrought scenes of torture. What I got was more akin to a haunted dream that left me pondering the passage of time. This is a bold film from a real artist. I’m not even raving about the movie. On letterboxed I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and It’s far from my favorite of the year. But I’m truly struck by the artistry and how much the movie surprised me.

These moments with Neal are probably the most human interaction he&#39;s had in nearly a decade and this scene where he finally fights back his only response is of what he had in his prior life before his wife&#39;s death. When you get that twist at the end of the movie it makes the entire movie that much more heartbreaking. Del&#39;s entire monologue is esentially him fighting back by just reininsicng on the life he once had.
