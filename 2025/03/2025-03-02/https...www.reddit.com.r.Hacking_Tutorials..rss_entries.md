<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished coding this DHCP flooder and thought I&#39;d share how it works!</p> <p>This is obviously for educational purposes only, but it&#39;s crazy how most routers (even enterprise-grade ones) aren&#39;t properly configured to handle DHCP packets and remain vulnerable to fake DHCP flooding.</p> <p>The code is pretty straightforward but efficient. I&#39;m using C++ with multithreading to maximize packet throughput. Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening under the hood: First, I create a packet pool of 1024 pre-initialized DHCP discovery packets to avoid constant reallocation. Each packet gets a randomized MAC address (starting with 52:54:00 prefix) and transaction ID. The real thing happens in the multithreaded approach, I spawn twice as many threads as CPU cores, with each thread sending a continuous stream of DHCP discover packets via UDP broadcast.</p> <p>Every 1000 packets, the code refreshes the MAC address and transaction ID to ensure variety.

Itâ€™s also shitty because I know the email address connected to it, however itâ€™s an old iCloud address and whilst I know the password to it, I set up two step verification and I donâ€™t have access to any old device or anything that I can get a code from so itâ€™s basically useless.
