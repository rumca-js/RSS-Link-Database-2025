I changes all those passwords, so hopefully nothing more will happen, but i know that the virus is still there.

Except that nothing happened. Since i changed the passwords nothing happened.</p> <p>Now, my question is whats my best bet? Is it to just reinstall windows? Will the reinstall 100% solve it, or no? What do i do? Thankfully i dont have anything too important on my pc, so even if i delete everything on it it wont matter much. What do yall say? I fucked up guys, i know, please help me.
