Became the Keeper of a Corporate Windows Enterprise Key</p> <p>Alright, buckle up—this is one of the weirdest tech finds I’ve ever had.</p> <p>Back in 2018, my wife and I ended up with a Surface 2 from her workplace. (They just threw this thing out for no reason) The device was completely locked down—Windows Enterprise with restaurant (I&#39;m not saying the actual restaurant because the restaurant chain has changed ownership), corporate branding, proprietary software, and no way to log in.</p> <p>At first, it seemed like junk.

Like several times per day every single day. Seems like all attempts are coming out of Vietnam. I have not noticed anything unusual except for yesterday my iPhone disconnected from 4 different Hotmail accounts simultaneously which prompted me to look deeper. Pretty sure that was an iOS glitch though as So far they have been unsuccessful. </p> <p>Question: </p> <ol> <li><p>Some things say unsuccessful sign in and other “unusual activity”. What qualifies as unusual activity?</p>
