        "description": "Sponsor: Thermaltake Tower 600 Case on Amazon https://geni.us/wjtN\nNVIDIA shipped RTX 5090, RTX 5090D, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 Ti GPUs with missing ROPs. We're not sure if that'll affect the 5070 cards yet. This is a major defect that can have a performance impact, with NVIDIA itself confirming a 4% impact to at least some situations with (it seems) the 5090; however, with the 5080, we're seeing more than that. In some situations, it's 0%. In others, it's as much as 9-11% higher performance with the properly made 5080. More people need to be aware of this. This is very easy to slip under the radar and end users would get screwed with worse performance than they were sold.\n\nWatch our video explaining more of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvBtfqU6svo\nWatch our coverage of AMD's RX 9070 announcements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAe50byQGG0\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
