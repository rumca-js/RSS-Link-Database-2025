<p>Beaty Rubens’s study of the impact of early radio broadcasts in Britain is full of fascinating and often poignant detail</p><p>One hundred years ago this summer, from high above Daventry in Northamptonshire, voices began to beam into the homes of 20 million people. They came from the 500ft tall Borough Hill transmitter – truly revolutionary technology in 1925 – which opened with a new work, Daventry Calling, by the poet Alfred Noyes.</p><p>“Sitting around your hearth/Ye are at one with all on earth,” the poem concluded, giving a utopian flavour that recurs often through Beaty Rubens’s meticulously detailed, engaging book. Exploring how radio transformed the lives of Britons between the two world wars, it’s a striking read in our smartphone-dominated world, as we witness another radical invention quickly becoming part of everyday life. A portal into other places from your own house was also an easy concept to sell. Take the cover of the first Christmas issue of <em>Radio Times</em>

<p>Singer, songwriter, actor and punk pioneer best known as the frontman of New York Dolls</p><p>On the day that the New York Dolls appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMtIMLvuDhc">on the BBC music show The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1973</a>, they were openly derided by the host, Bob Harris. “Mock rock,” he opined to camera.</p><p>For all his snarling attitude, the band’s singer, David Johansen, who has died aged 75, might well have agreed. The last thing he expected was for his band to be taken seriously. The Dolls took their lead not from the “adult-oriented” rock and earnest singer-songwriters dominating the US album charts, but from the glam rock scene making headway in the UK singles charts. British acts from the Sex Pistols to Morrissey would later repay the compliment, citing the band as a key influence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/mar/02/david-johansen-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 33-year-old coach discusses the differences between working in Europe and the US, losing the NWSL Championship final and moving abroad for the first time</p><p><strong>After spending all of your career coaching in Spain, since June you have been coaching in the American NWSL, as the head coach of Washington Spirit. Thinking more broadly about the NWSL, what differences have you observed in style of play in this league, compared to European football? </strong>“Yes, being honest, it’s different. I think in Spain and Europe, regarding tactical plans, there is a high, high level, and here it is very entertaining, because the style of play [here] is thinking ‘what do I have to do to give my best to the supporters and make the people enjoy?’ Only 25-30% of the games here are won by a difference of two goals. The rest of the games, there’s only one goal difference. That means that the league is very competitive. So this is very difficult if you compare it with my past with Barcelona

<p>The writer’s impressive second novel about an erotic dancer and newbie dominatrix straddles thriller and satire in its depiction of desire and longing</p><p>Brittany Newell’s second novel is hard to position – is it a noirish thriller, a sex-work satire, a romance? What it is not, and here the author is clear, is a memoir. Newell is a Stanford graduate and a professional dominatrix; her life has bled into <em>Soft Core – </em>but, as she recently told America’s NPR, into the novel’s “sensory details” rather than the facts. This murkiness is one of the defining textures of the book, giving it an uncanny, almost ghostly&nbsp;feel.

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells East, London</strong><br>Indian-American dancer Prakash dismantles the myth of a female goddess granted power by men</p><p>As a child, Mythili Prakash was always puzzled by the myth around the goddess Durga, who was created by a panel of male gods to slay the demon Mahisha. Why should a woman be given her power by a man, she wondered. And it’s something she’s still wondering about.<br><br>
 She’s Auspicious is a dismantling of the idea of woman being put on a pedestal, bestowed with value through someone else’s eyes. Being shaped by an outside view of womanhood – even a supposedly flattering one – is a suffocation of sorts. Prakash is an Indian-American dancer, best known in the UK for performing with Akram Khan, who has mentored her.

<p>The city’s madcap mix of bingo, dressing up and dancing has become a cultural phenomenon, bucking the trend of a declining UK club scene and packing venues nationwide. Ahead of the night’s 10th anniversary, our writer gives it a go</p><p>In Liverpool, in a vast warehouse lined with bierkeller trestle tables, each one sardine-packed with people, a woman is dancing. She is dancing on her seat to Europe’s The Final Countdown. With her arms in the air, she is bellowing out the words and, indeed, the synth riff. It is 8pm. The woman is me.</p><p>Around me, everyone is doing exactly the same. To my right, a woman in full chicken costume is flapping her wings. To the left, a beautiful dark-haired girl, with the look of an Italian Dolce &amp; Gabbana model at her rich husband’s funeral, is up with her crew, screeching, waving a glass of something sticky and deadly. I look around. I can’t see anybody – not a single person in the room – who isn’t singing along and dancing on the benches.</p

It has grand spaces – the white stone and shadowless light of the Norman Foster-designed Great Court, the classical halls designed by its original architect Robert Smirke to display statues of Pharaonic scale, and the Parthenon-sized Duveen Gallery, built in the 1930s to house the marble sculptures from the famous temple. Beyond and between them is a tissue of spaces and passages, hard to navigate, like the back corridors and lumber rooms of a stately home, in which exquisite vases and reliefs languish in dim cases and on dull walls, over floors tiled in the bureaucratic beige of a 1970s revamp.</p><p>Overhead there’s a hodgepodge of skylights and valley gutt

Though she has reported on women for almost two decades, she has been surprised by the transformations of motherhood. “I went into it so unprepared,” she says. “I cannot begin to tell you.” Like other soon-to-be parents, Dooley decided against attending antenatal classes and rejected manuals offered by friends. “You know, I used to see mums finding it tough and I’d think, ‘It can’t be <em>that</em> hard.’ I really used to think that. Which is fucking hil<em>arious</em>. I owe all of those women an apology.”</p><p>Dooley and I are in a hotel café in Knightsbridge, west London, where she is later due to meet her accountant.

<p>Maintaining pace with the US president’s wild outbursts and the mind-boggling media reports about him is no laughing matter</p><p>The smelly thoughts of Donald Trump bubble up like brown burps in the sort of bombsite pond Chopper bike-riding children were advised to avoid in 1970s public information films. Do they indicate concrete plans, are they designed to provoke, or do they have no meaning, like the gurgles and gasps that can inadvertently escape from a decomposing corpse? My job here is to try to anticipate if anything Trump says or does is likely to be of any lasting significance and to satirise it accordingly, in the small window of time allowed, for money. And it isn’t getting any easier. Yes, Ukraine is suffering, but I am the real victim here.</p><p>For example, last Saturday Trump opined: “We were the richest… think of this, from 1870 to 1913… because we collected tariffs… We had so much wealth.

Our journey involves two buses, a tube, an overground, and 20 minutes of walking either side.

## The Sound of Music at 60: a flawed but enduring cultural touchpoint

<p>The 1965 musical has its faults but it remains a deserving and enduring point of reference for so many of us</p><p>Many of the formative films of my childhood come with crisp sense memories of the first time I saw them: precisely what cinema or whose couch, the time of day and the weather outside, who I was watching with, my in-the-moment reactions to what delights or shocks the film threw at me.</p><p>The Sound of Music, however, is an exception. Robert Wise’s swirling, swollen 1965 film version of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical has been a personal favourite since long before I ever thought to list personal favourites – a seasonal staple, a constant generator of unprompted earworms, a point of good-natured familial conflict between those who love it and those who merely pretend not to, a film so laden with short-cut iconography that it rushes quickly to mind when I see a certain shade of upholstery, a particular bob haircut or even a passing nun.</p> <a href="https://www.t

The third feature from <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/19/palo-alto-review-listless-portrait-american-adolescence">Palo Alto</a></em>-director Gia Coppola (granddaughter of Francis, niece of Sofia), <em>The Last Showgirl</em> is a wisp of a thing, clocking in at under 90 minutes and shot in just 18 days. The film’s structure, more a series of vignettes than a linear narrative, feels like the fleeting reflections of a life captured in the facets of a mirror ball.

<p>After three rounds of the 2025 Six Nations, we assess the impact of World Rugby’s latest package of law tweaks</p><p>No sport has a more torturous ­relationship with its law book than rugby union. Mainly because those laws keep mutating, sprouting new clauses and subclauses like a wordy virus. In 2018 matters had reached such a point of impenetrability that World Rugby rewrote the entire book, its plodding 160 pages reduced by 42%.</p><p>Since 2018, of course, that ­slimline version has continued mutating, and last week World Rugby updated it again. Some of it was changing ­terminology: it is now officially the try line, not the goal line; a knock-on is a knock forward; and a word that never existed in the real world ­anyway, the jackaller, is henceforth to be known as the stealer.

<p>Experts hope research can create greener methods of extracting the metal vital for renewable energy revolution and boom in electrical devices</p><p>It is the key ingredient of bronze, the alloy that helped create some of the world’s greatest civilisations and took humanity out of the stone age on its way to modern times.

<p>Bright and light, cool-climate wines have a style all of their own</p><p><strong>Iona Elgin Highlands Sauvignon Blanc, Elgin, South Africa 2024 (£17.99, <a href="http://virginwines.co.uk/">virginwines.co.uk</a>) </strong>From ‘oak-aged’ and ‘wild-ferment’ to ‘single-vineyard’ and ‘hand-picked’, wine producers and sellers have a habit of dressing up descriptive phrases as implied shorthand for quality. They’re not alone in that, of course, or even the worst offenders: no wine term is as insidiously irritating as ‘pan-fried’ or ‘handcooked’. Still, it can be grating when something unexceptional, even a little banal about the where and how of a wine’s production is presented as the key to its unique brilliance. I’ve grown wearily sceptical in recent years, for example, of the incessant use of ‘cool climate’ as a term of praise, not least when it’s used to describe wines from places that aren’t, in the global context, very cool at all. Still, there are moments when its use is both fac
