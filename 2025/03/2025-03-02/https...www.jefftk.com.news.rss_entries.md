I realized I've been eating oranges wrong for years.  I cut them into
slices and eat them slice by slice.  Which is fine, except that I'm
wasting the zest.  Zest is tasty, versatile, compact, and freezes
well.  So now, whenever I eat a navel orange I zest it first:

The zest goes in a small container in the freezer, and is available
for cooking and baking as needed.  Probably my favorite thing to do
with it right now is steep it in cream (~3-15g per cup, bring to near
boil, leave for 20min, filter) and then use the cream for all sorts
