<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have one VPS thats running about 5 Django servers behind nginx. All are using gunicorn and are somewhat complex. Celery tasks and management commands running on cron.</p> <p>But i have one of them that is causing a huge problem.</p> <pre><code>[Errno 24] Too many open files: &#39;myfile.pickle&#39; </code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>could not translate host name &quot;my-rds-server-hostname&quot; </code></pre> <p>When i run this one server the number of handles open when running</p> <pre><code>lsof | wc -l </code></pre> <p>Is 62,000 files / handles. When i kill this one gunicorn server, it goes down to 600 open files / handles.</p> <p>I have no idea what could be causing this many open handles in this one server process. Each other gunicorn has a few hundred but this one has like 59,000 just by itself. These files are opened the SECOND the server starts so its not some kind of long term leak.</p> <p>I was thinking maybe a stray import or something

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On development, I have containerized Django, Celery worker/beat, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis spun up via docker-compose.</p> <p>On production, I have two separate VPNs (EC2 instances). In the first instance, I host the PostgreSQL. In the second instance, I have the Django, Celery worker/beat, Nginx, RabbitMQ, and Redis running on the docker containers via docker-compose.</p> <p>Do you think this is the best approach? Or should I only containerized the Django, Celery worker/beat, and Nginx and move the RabbitMQ and Redis on the separate instance where the db server resides?</p> <p>What are your suggestions?
