I&#39;m trying to squeeze as many files onto a tape as possible without going over and splitting files across multiple tapes.<br/> Currently, I&#39;m using: tar -b 256 -rvf /dev/st0 /file/path/0</p> <p>While this works, it takes forever to save the 5ish files I&#39;m attempting to put on the tape since it has to read the entire tape to find the end of the data before writing.</p> <p>I want to avoid multiple file markers so that if I ever have to pull/restore any files from the tape, I don&#39;t have to remember to move through various file markers.</p> <p>Is there a way to utilize the fsf &amp; bsf commands to move to the end of the data, but just before the eof mark, write new data without erasing the existing data?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoPaleontologist8155"> /u/NoPaleonto

I recently acquired a WD Black 8tb external hdd to backup an 8tb data drive that is in my system. My data drive has 6.74tb of data on it. When I tried to do a 1:1 copy to the WD it said I was something like 750+gb short on space. I have tried using hd sentinel and disk genius to get an idea of what&#39;s up to no avail. Fresh out of the box I formatted the drive and it showed the proper 7.27tb in Windows yet I still can&#39;t copy 6.74tb to 7.27tb. Doing the math it almost seems as if the WD enclosure actually has a 6tb drive installed in it with the firmware fudged. Or, there is a shit ton of bad sectors that can&#39;t be written to but I feel like hd sentinel at least would have reported this.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to build a small Linux NAS, and out of the box Linux doesn&#39;t put hard drives to sleep. I know that some electronics wears out faster when it&#39;s always switched on and off as opposed to being on constantly, but is this the case for HDDs and is it worth setting up sleep for them on a NAS? Noise isn&#39;t a problem, I actually kinda like it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/abbbbbcccccddddd"> /u/abbbbbcccccddddd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1j1mhai/constant_spinning_vs_onoff_for_hdds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1j1mhai/constant_spinning_vs_onoff_for_hdds/">[comments]</a></span>

## AM4 3700X or upgrade for dedicated upgrade?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My home lab is running on my desktop right now but I finally have some parts available: </p> <p>an AM4 X570 Mobo, plenty of old cases, a spare PSU, 16GB of ram, a couple of spare 1TB NVMEs, a 1660 Super, and a 3700X. I’m working with existing disks now but the plan is to buy four 10-14 TB disks to start. </p> <p>so I’m wondering if I have the building blocks I need for a decent home data vault slash plex server slash home lab for running a few dockers and LXMs? </p> <p>Or should I get a beefier AM4 CPU or GPU and more ram?</p> <p>Also I know I can run unraid and that sounds appealing but is there anything wrong with just running windows on the whole thing? I guess I’m not sure how NAS functionality and building raids on windows works. It’s easy right? 😂</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/elijuicyjones"> /u/elijuicyjones </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1j1kamz/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been finding so many interesting unknown niche games on this year&#39;s Steam NextFest. Rather than lose track of them after the event is over and praying they show up in my recommended someday or become popular enough on their own, I want to archive the titles or thumbnails of every NextFest game included up til the last day on March 3rd.</p> <p>But I have no idea how to do this besides manually wishlisting all 2340 titles (So far) so I can sort through and judge them all. I&#39;ve already asked Steam Support if they could provide a list or archive of the participants but that fell through. So I figured I&#39;d ask some experienced data hoarders.</p> <p>My ultimate goal is to curate some interesting games to share with the world in case they&#39;re missed, as there&#39;s lots of games with bad launches or no advertising that slip through the cracks despite being excellent.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi - I&#39;ve been copying our archived media to LTO for several months now, using Canister, without issues. Recently I discovered that one of the LTO tapes is not mounting, and in Canister it only says &quot;Format&quot;, with no option to even &quot;Repair&quot; as it is greyed out. Yoyotta also does not recognize the tape as mounted. </p> <p>We have it on our records that the tape copied 8.9TB successfully, via the transfer logs. </p> <p>Has anyone had experience with this type of problem? mLogic support says that the index file may have been erased somehow, but don&#39;t know how to move forward from there. Any details or guidance helps. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Can_5251"> /u/No_Can_5251 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1j1ejnn/lto_tape_index_file_erased_possibly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoar

## Picked up one of those Seagate 20tb externals from Best Buy as a backup for my DS923+. Shuck or nah?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve transferred two tb to it so far and it&#39;s not making any sad sounds or being weird. I was just gonna plug it into the USB on the DS923 and use hyper backup, but now I&#39;m wondering if I should just shuck it as it seems the odds are in favor of it being an Exos or Iron Wolf branded as a Barracuda (my eyes are killing me from all the comments I&#39;ve read). I have a DS220+ laying around collecting dust and it&#39;s only purpose would be backing up my DS923. I have two 20tb IWP and two 8tb IWP in the 923 and I&#39;d love another 20tb in there, but not with this drive and I don&#39;t need the space yet. As a backup though? Seems like a win. I&#39;d get to spool up a spare NAS I could maybe move off-site one day, and I&#39;d get better monitoring as opposed to an external device, too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/angrycatmeowmeow"> /u/angrycatmeowmeow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:
