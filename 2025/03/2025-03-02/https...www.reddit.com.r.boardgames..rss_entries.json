However, something i didn&#39;t like was learning that you have to choose one of your two personal objectives early in the game and you can&#39;t undo the decision. I wonder if it would be more fun and flexible to hold both objectives the whole game? I just assume that picking one early could end up giving an impossible task and then you have no backup plan. Also, I generally prefer less confrontational games so I think it would be nice if the &quot;evil&quot; objectives remained an option that a player could do instead of being forced to work against other players. I would think that also adds some suspense because you know other players could at any moment pick one or the other. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/5t01k\"> /u/5t01k </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j1loac/nemesis_woul",
