<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow self-hosted enthousiasts. Me and my friends all have multiple servers running at different locations. We were trying to find a solution for a distributed storage system.</p> <p>Requirements: 1. E2EE; no user could peek on the files of others. 2. User access control (of some sort); each user only has access to their own files. Ideally only a portion of the total amount of storage is allocated to them. 3. No central &quot;node&quot;. If any system goes out, the network can keep operating normally. 4. (Not necessary) Dashboard that shows the status of each system, and the storage used by each user, which files have been synced accross each server etc.</p> <p>We were thinking something where we could all contribute 1TB of our storage and then (4 users eg) each one of us could have 200MB allocated to them that would be synced accross the rest of the machines.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/us

So might as well do it &quot;better&quot;?</p> <p>And, for context, this is running on proxmox.</p> <p>Quick google suggests most crowds fall into three camps. &quot;Use cockpit&quot; which I already do and don&#39;t suepr like. &quot;Use open media vault&quot; which seems like overkill (and is suggested to run as a VM not an LXC) but also...
