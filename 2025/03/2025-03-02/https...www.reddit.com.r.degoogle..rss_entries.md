## Leaving Google Chat, is there a way to transfer chat messages history to a different app efficiently?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: want to switch to a different messaging app, but the chat history in one of the chats is important and I&#39;d want it transferred to the other chatting app. Editing the export file of chat history from the new app by manually adding in every message sent on Google Chat would be, to put it mildly, inefficient and plain excruciating, so is there an efficient way to get Google Chat messaging history export converted or changed in formatting to match that of a different app? Is there any executable script out there that can be used for this? Also, the chatting app I&#39;m switching to is Wire, and I&#39;m now doubting if transferring messages to it like that would be even possible, so if that&#39;s the case, any rec&#39;s? </p> <h1></h1> <p>It&#39;s been over 3 weeks, maybe a month or more, that I&#39;ve been actively working to switch to better, more privacy-respecting messaging apps, and while just searching for apps I can use
