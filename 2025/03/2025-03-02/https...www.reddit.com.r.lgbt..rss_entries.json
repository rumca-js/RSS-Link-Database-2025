Recently, a law went into effect making it so you are legally required to use the bathroom that corresponds with your gender at birth at any k-12 school or state college. It also requires that all all gender bathrooms be limited to single occupant. Because of this, I have no bathroom I can legally use at the building I spend most of my day at. I have walk about 3 minutes to a bathroom across the street. I literally had to wait 15 minutes just to go to the bathroom since this bathroom had a line waiting for it.

I&#39;m starting to really question if we are straight. While in vr, we went into a bathtub together and cleaned eachother while kissing around four times. Then we went to a nice bed and I sat on his face and then he ate me out, we then kissed again. After this I put him over my leg and spanked him and we kissed again. Issue is, I got horny from HIS moans. Sure it was a woman&#39;s face but the way he moaned did something. We talked and held eachother for a bit after with a lot of kisses and head pats, he admitted that he liked the kisses and the head pats. And after we finally got off because he was tired, I was telling him to sleep like a concerned boyfriend. When he finally left, he said that he almost said &quot;love you&quot; instead of goodnight.
