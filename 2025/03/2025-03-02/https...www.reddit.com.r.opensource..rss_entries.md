<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, so for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve been working on a mobile music-player app for personal use. After a while, I started considering open-sourcing the app once I feel it&#39;s &quot;ready&quot; for the world to see. However, since I&#39;m developing it in my free time alongside university, I often think about how to cover expenses like bills. Given the costs associated with maintaining a mobile app, even a passion project like this, I plan to incorporate donations as a way to help cover expenses. I believe this is a good approach that avoids putting features behind a paywall, maintaining the app&#39;s accessibility for all users.</p> <p>As this is would be my first open-source project, I&#39;m also thinking about how to grow a community around the app and, in the future, my projects in general. While I understand that open-source contributions are often a labor of love, I&#39;m would like to find ways to ensure the effort involved in devel

From the moral standpoint, when I was in uni and wanted to code my first automated trading bot, I remembered there was practically no publicly available trading bot.

This was something I promised myself many years ago if I do create a successful trading bot I will open source it so other people can potentially use my project to create better trained models or projects.
