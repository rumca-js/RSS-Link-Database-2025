<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm 17 years old and I create educational content on YouTube. I explain concepts using my hands on a graphic tablet, and it‚Äôs pretty fun because I‚Äôm trying to mimic a YouTuber called ‚ÄúThe Organic Chemistry Tutor‚Äù. Thankfully, the results turn out well, and I‚Äôm satisfied with them, but I don‚Äôt want to stop there.</p> <p>I want to create animations for these concepts using code. For example, I‚Äôd like to animate specific types of waves or create visualizations to explain Molecular Orbital Theory and similar topics.</p> <p>When I tried searching on YouTube, I felt completely lost and it‚Äôs lwk a huge topic. Basically, all I know is that I draw shapes or the models using code, then transfer them to After Effects, which feels quite complex.</p> <p>Is it really that hard, or should I just stick to the traditional explanation style until I get into college or smth? </p> <p>Also, if anyone has suggestions on how I can improve, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.</p> </d
