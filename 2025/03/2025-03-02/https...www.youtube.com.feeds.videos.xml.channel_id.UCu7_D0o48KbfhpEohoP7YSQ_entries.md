Time nuts are people deeply interested in exact timekeeping. They usually use atomic clocks to get to this holy grail. In todayâ€™s video, we will get precise time without internet access or a personal atomic clock. Instead, we will use 5-10 dollar GPS receivers. Fortunately, the atomic clocks we will use are paid for by other people.
