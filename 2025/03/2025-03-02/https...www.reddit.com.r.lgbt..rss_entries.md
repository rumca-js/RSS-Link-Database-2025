<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (mtf19) am a student at a state university in Ohio. Recently, a law went into effect making it so you are legally required to use the bathroom that corresponds with your gender at birth at any k-12 school or state college. It also requires that all all gender bathrooms be limited to single occupant. Because of this, I have no bathroom I can legally use at the building I spend most of my day at. I have walk about 3 minutes to a bathroom across the street. I literally had to wait 15 minutes just to go to the bathroom since this bathroom had a line waiting for it. I don’t want to use the men’s restroom for fear of harassment. And I’m just done. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BssnKing14"> /u/BssnKing14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1j21uou/i_have_to_leave_the_building_to_use_the_bathroom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(If you need context look at my previous post) So we did vr again today, we were on for a good couple hours. I&#39;m starting to really question if we are straight. While in vr, we went into a bathtub together and cleaned eachother while kissing around four times. Then we went to a nice bed and I sat on his face and then he ate me out, we then kissed again. After this I put him over my leg and spanked him and we kissed again. Issue is, I got horny from HIS moans. Sure it was a woman&#39;s face but the way he moaned did something. We talked and held eachother for a bit after with a lot of kisses and head pats, he admitted that he liked the kisses and the head pats. And after we finally got off because he was tired, I was telling him to sleep like a concerned boyfriend. When he finally left, he said that he almost said &quot;love you&quot; instead of goodnight.
