Parts of the tales are narrated from the point of view of Frenchman who becomes obsessed with, grooms and abducts a fifteen year-old girl, then passes her off as his daughter-well aware yet in denial that he is in Humbert Humbert territory. The two become part of small close knit group of art world eccentrics, many of who likewise become obsessed with the young woman. These people are all bound by secrets they are keeping from each other and when a cache of nude paintings of the woman is discovered, it sets in motion an unravelling of secrets that lead to murder. Well-paced, well-written and suspenseful, this a compelling story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/econoquist\"> /u/econoquist </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j21zjk/in_malice_quite_close_by_brandi_lynn_ryder/\">[link",
