To me it seems as though the ai is just randomly highlighting stuff and passing it off as AI generated. I understand that it looks for patterns but was looking for more explanations as to how these softwares look in the first place. Today I wrote my lab report (~8 pages with citations and alot of data) for class and I grew curious so I threw my paper through several ai/plagrism detection softwares and the results varied HEAVILY. One site said 27% while another said that it was human written with only 5%, another claimed 45%. It gave me a chuckle to be honest but then at the same time it kinda makes me worried as everything we submit gets ran through turnitin, so what are the odds of a false positive occurring?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/D-cr_pt\"> /u/D-cr_pt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",

Many of those same people, if you were to chat with them via text, might not come across as having &quot;generalized intelligence&quot;. Those people may get by with some narrow skill, or often just by being able to socialize well enough that others support them. Would you say that all healthy, neurotypical adult humans have at least the level of AGI you&#39;d require from an LLM or other AI in order to be labelled &quot;AGI&quot;? It seems that many believe an AGI should be &quot;capable of being good at anything a human can do&quot; or something to that effect, but it doesn&#39;t seem that most humans even meet that criteria.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
