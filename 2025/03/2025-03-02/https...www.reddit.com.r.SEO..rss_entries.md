<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’m trying to help my wife sort out something she’s been seeing at work. She writes digital articles. So they get info how many clicks they get on their articles an ranks. They all use the same seo template. The interesting part is once they have start offering bonuses for 1st 2nd and 3rd one writer has been staying at number 1 with wild high clicks/views. But hasn’t been doing this high before this became a thing with bonuses. </p> <p>Example would be 800,000 clicks to now 3.3 million clicks consistently now. Just seems rather strange. Could this person be using a bot farm to click the article links? Sorry if this is the wrong sub not where else to ask this question. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/diwhychuck"> /u/diwhychuck </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1j22os0/general_web_traffic_clicks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been fighting the meta descriptions of my website since November. All my competition have nice meta descriptions, but Google ignores mine and uses the first line on each page as a description which just doesn’t look good. Any idea how I can fix this? The website has been crawled by Google and when I inspect it it knows my description it just chooses not to use it. My description is the perfect amount of symbols so fits fully, clean and up to the point. Google did like my titles thankfully. </p> <p>Here’s the description. “Manual JDS Services | Duct design for permit | Fast turnaround &amp; 24h Delivery Available! | ACCA Approved Software and over 20 years of experience in the field.”</p> <p>Do you see a reason Google might not like this description? Everyone of my competitors uses something like this just written differently each time and I would say that mine sounds the best.<br/> Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, 1 and half years ago I was immersed in the world of digital marketing. Actually, I was just trying to put my foot on the edge of the digital marketing world. But after a while, I sank in and surpringly I loved it. I&#39;m getting more curious and finally at this point I can handle influencer marketing(Twitter), affiliate marketing and developing social media marketing strategies/campaigns. I took a step further to advance by taking courses like digital marketing and content marketing from Hubspot. Also created more time to understand the basics of SEO and integrated marketing communication by partaking in the Coursera coursework. Over this period I&#39;ve learnt a lot and worked of small projects. However, I&#39;m looking for more volunteer projects related to digital marketing which I can work on so as to enrich my portfolio. If you have any project you feel my skills can be put into use feel free to reach out to me. </p> </div><!--
