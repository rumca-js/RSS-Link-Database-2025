<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings fellow readers and book enthusiasts. I suppose i am looking for something quite specific.<br/> I&#39;m looking to read a book about the art of Comedy, its history and research, here are some points that would hopefully explain what i want (preferably in one book, but don&#39;t shy away from recommending a couple):<br/> (obligatory):<br/> - Where did comedy come from and when did it start to shape up to the thing we know now as comedy.<br/> - Types of comedy.<br/> - Differences between comedy in Film, theatre and day to day life. etc..<br/> - analysis of known comics and comedians<br/> (optional):<br/> - what makes good comedy.<br/> - workshop about writing comedy in different channels.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZaKKaryy"> /u/ZaKKaryy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j24zqi/book_about_comedy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some context:</p> <p>The book can get very technical and specific from a chemistry perspective. It started out quite accessible, but I&#39;m 86 pages in and can barely even tell you what the chapter I just finished is about. I can pay more attention and understand it, but then there&#39;s still the issue of retaining all that information. What would be the point of all this effort? I just need to know what I should do. Focus on key points. If he said anything important, I couldn&#39;t tell. I zoned out from all the chemistry. </p> <p>Maybe if you have a keen interest in chemistry, you would find this book very interesting. I just have a keen interest in knowing how to increase my chances of living longer. I preferred to read the book rather than watching interviews and break downs of the book by Peter Attia or anyone else because I learn better from books. However, if the chemistry isn&#39;t toned down, I&#39;m not wasting my time with 330 more pages

I really enjoyed Bonjour Tristesse, which was about a girl’s summer in France, and I also REALLY enjoyed (although I didn’t expect to) The Great Gatsby. I loved Fitzgerald’s writing style and how he brought the setting to life. I also recently bought The Garden By The Sea, and expect to enjoy that.

I read about so many things, romance, billionaire romance, werewolf, vampire, monster name it. I think I&#39;ve read most of the genres. I love reading but I guess when college rolled in I got so busy that reading was something so hard to do for me, my entertainment became just an hour of movies or series. Because at least it&#39;s not a long term commitment I&#39;m making. And I guess I lost the same passion I&#39;ve had in needing to read something, it&#39;s been 5 years, and I really want to get back at it. But I guess I want to make sure to find that passion again that I wanna read something I know I&#39;ll be obsessed with not just a &#39; meh&#39; read.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me start by saying I am normally a thriller, suspense, or horror reader. My favorite authors are Stephen king and Scott smith. But I am really looking to expand my horizons. Please give me suggestions for your absolute favorite of all time romance reads. The type of stories that even non romance readers can get sucked into. I’m also open to historical fiction and pretty much any other fiction novels.

## Suggestions for fiction books that delve into emotion/realism of human relationships

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not really sure how to word what I&#39;m wanting to be honest. I&#39;m just getting back into reading as an adult. I read so much as a kid, and I was really into the YA dystopia/alternate reality style books (hunger games, Gregor the overlander, the giver, ect.) But I&#39;ve tried to pick up stuff in that genre again and they feel weirdly... Hollow for me now. </p> <p>I just finished reading The Help, and it&#39;s the first book I&#39;ve picked up since I began again that really captured my interest. I think because of the realistic emotions and social implications for the characters. I&#39;m not usually a historical fiction person, so that&#39;s not exactly what I&#39;m looking for. Just a book that feels grounded in real emotional stakes that makes you truly fond of the characters. Doesn&#39;t have to be an entirely realistic setting, but I want the core of the conflict to be internal or social, not really &quot;we need to overthrow this cartoonish

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Reddit! Repost from another subreddit. My friend (f25) was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis when she was three. Today, we went to a book warehouse, and I noticed she picked up a book that I didn’t see the title of. I excitedly asked her what she got, saw the title was “Living with Chronic Pain,” and dropped my excitement to say, “Oh, that’s sad.” We had a big laugh about the contrast between my excitement and the book’s topic. Then she said she’s been looking for a book that’s about rheumatoid arthritis, but she’s only found rheumatoid arthritis books for older people. She hasn’t found any books for people written her age.</p> <p>I did see a handful online that miiiiiiight fit that description, but since I haven’t read them, I’m not sure and don’t want to buy it in case it’s not what she wants. Does anyone have suggestions? Even a book that talks about arthritis without mentioning age would make her happy. Let me know!</p> </div><!-

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My grandmother lost her husband, my grandfather, and it was somewhat unexpected. (Edit: the anniversary of his passing is coming up on 2 years in May, so this is not fresh) We&#39;re very close and we talk regularly over the phone, but I live out of town so I don&#39;t get to spend much time with her. She&#39;s been opening up to me that she&#39;s been struggling with loneliness and she tried a few &quot;old people&quot; activities like bingo but they made her anxious. Her doctor put her on Prozac last year and she&#39;s still struggling with depression and anxiety.</p> <p>She told me she&#39;s considering picking up some reading to see if that helps, since its been helping me with my own mental health struggles. Does anyone have any fiction or non-fiction books that help process with this kind of grief? I wanna make a list of book recommendations for her that might help her feel less lonely and/or come to terms with her new life as an elderly widow.
