Currently, each client&#39;s portal URL is branded, following the format [clientname].example.com. With our growing popularity, concerns have been raised about this becoming a significant phishing vector. Our team proposes switching to a non-branded, numerical subdomain format, like portal-1234567.example.com.</p> <p>My question is: How can we effectively balance brand recognition and user convenience with mitigating the risk of phishing in a multi-application, client-branded portal environment? Are non-branded numerical subdomains the most effective solution, or are there alternative strategies we should consider? Specifically, what are the best practices for user education, authentication, and URL design in this context? Cite any industry standards such as NIST, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",
