To do this, I built a simple tool that fetches the latest posts from selected subreddits and sends them to an LLM for analysis. The model classifies them and provides brief insights.</p> <p>I add subreddits related to topics that interest me and try to understand what issues users are facing. This way, I compile a set of problems that could potentially be solved with a well-designed product.</p> <p>Even though this tool is still in its early stages, it has already proven to be quite useful for me, and I\u2019d like to share it with the community.

Think of it as a smarter, collaborative way to manage event music finally solving the \u201cWho picked this song?!\u201d problem.</p> <p>Why I Built This</p> <p>Last year, I was running a small side hustle organizing local events backyard BBQs, game nights, even a friend\u2019s wedding. The recurring pain point? Music. Guests would send a barrage of Spotify links, someone would hijack the playlist, and half the room would end up disengaged. It was a mess.</p> <p>As a dev, I saw a chance to fix it. I decided to step away from my side gig and spent late nights digging into Spotify\u2019s API, training an AI model to blend guest suggestions with mood-matching recommendations. The result is EventBeats, a platform that turns chaotic requests into playlists everyone enjoys.</p> <p>How It Works</p",

I need some genuine help now, I cannot for the life of me find out why on earth everytime the purchase slot button is pressed the globe sort of has this slight lag, and on lower spec laptops it even says wait for a response time on chrome, it eventually un lags and lets you continue to purchase, but how can I fix this I\u2019ve had many users come and say this is the main part, I\u2019ve reduced the rendering of the stars in background a lot, I\u2019ve changed DNS server, could it be the browser struggles to handle a millionblock/pixels rotating? Is it the coding? I mean even if I reduce it down to 600x600 it does the same, currently on 1000x1000 to match its predecessor. Any one with a very powerful rig able to test it out see if there\u2019s still lag? Seems to load on iPhones fine, but just pc not so much. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",

So I had to submit screenshots/images to App Store in different preset sizes by device to store. That was like 10+10 pictures resized, checked etc. It was manual and I spent a good 30+ minutes doing it.</p> <p>Long story short, I wanted to build a tool that can do it all in seconds. You drag/drop bunch of pictures, select a preset according to apple App Store or Google play store requirements in drop down, press resize and viola.</p> <p>So I created a resizing tool. Then I proceeded to go &quot;hmm, how about a tool for converting images from one format to other&quot;? and then more.</p> <p>That&#39;s how I built &quot;ImageWizardry&quot; with nextJS/React/tailwindcss/Typescript.</p> <p>Please try it and let me know what you think. I will be adding AI based image tools in next versions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.imagewiza",
