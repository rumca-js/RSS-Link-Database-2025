Using yt-dlp scaps out at 1000 due to Dailymotion&#39;s API and even when loading all of the links on a browser, exporting as a list and downloading from that list manually, it seems to only download 990 (when there are about 1250 links that&#39;re actually on the list.) I can&#39;t figure out a way to download every video that actually exists on the account and would appreciate some guidance. Even when I do download what yt-dlp <em>does</em> catch, it downloads at a snail&#39;s pace at 1mb/s. If anyone here has expertise on scraping Dailymotion, I&#39;d appreciate the help.</p> <p>The accounts are<br/> <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/chris-bryant\">https://www.dailymotion.com/chris-bryant</a><a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/chuck-donegan\">https://www.dailymotion.com/ch",

I&#39;m thinking I want to rip them all so should I look into a NAS (truenas or OMV) and run Jellyfin as a VM, docker, or separate PC. Or just add more drives onto the current PC (I don&#39;t think 8tb is enough but we&#39;ll see.</p> <p>It does need to be simple enough where when I move out of my parents I can walk them through repairs if something happens (drive dies).

Assuming the network becomes big, there will be lots and lots of deduplication potential, which will of course result in lower price per unit. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see where the price / TB converges.

It can now only burn BD-RE, and not without issues. It hasn&#39;t outright failed a burn since I cleaned the lens and lubricated the carriage&#39;s acme screw, but the laser diode seems to be failing, despite having only burned around a hundred discs. Some of them were burned at 12X or maybe even 14X though, which apparently really cuts into the lifespan of the blue laser diode.</p> <p>I have about 1.5 terabytes of data to backup at the moment, but my data collection grows mostly slowly and incrementally, at most a hundred gigabytes per year. I&#39;ve read that the LG bluray burners like the WH14NS40 manufactured recently are not as reliable as they once were. Is that truly the case? Are Pioneer drives really that much more long-lived for mostly burning jobs? I could get a BDR-S13UBK for ~210 USD (300 CAD) vs ~60 USD (90 CAD) for an LG WH14NS4",

I want to use a website/app/tool/something that is <em>free</em> to take all my music from spotify, save it to a folder on my windows laptop, then save that to my external hard drive.</p> <p>Appreciate you all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mindfulwarr",
