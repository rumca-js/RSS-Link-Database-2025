For more than two years during the second world war, a teenager named Irene Gut kept 12 Polish Jews safe from the Nazis, hidden in a basement right under the nose of her boss, a high-ranking Nazi officer. Following the war, Gut emigrated to America and never spoke a word about her wartime experiences until the mid 1970s. Now the story of her remarkable courage and heroism is told very politely in an English-language drama that feels a little too tactful in places to really say anything about the horrors of Nazism.</p><p>Sophie N\u00e9lisse plays Irena, a Polish trainee nurse forced into slave labour by the Germans following the occupation in 1939, put to work first in a factory then a hotel. Then Nazi officer R\u00fcgemer (Dougray Scott) picks her to be his housekeeper \u2013 and when she moves in to his sprawling villa, Irena also sneaks in",

Steph Curry was 33 for most of that season. Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were 31. The Warriors\u2019 return to the pinnacle of basketball had the whiff of a last hurrah, and indeed, their championship core faded for a second time after that: a second-round exit in 2023, a play-in tournament flatlining in 2024.
