Last week that new Linux driver arrived in the form of the NVIDIA 570.133.07 Linux build. That new NVIDIA Linux driver is working out great with the GeForce RTX 5070 Founder's Edition and in this article are some initial Linux gaming/graphics performance benchmarks for that new graphics card competing with the AMD Radeon RX 9070 series.",
