This time, however, Meta is enlisting school officials directly in an effort to speed up its response to safety issues affecting young teens. The company is introducing a new \u201cSchools Partnership Program\u201d that aims to give teachers and school administrators a way to intervene when students experience bullying on Instagram.</p>\n<p>The program offers schools something that many parents have long said they wanted: a way to fast-track in-app reports that directly affect young students. Meta is promising that schools who join the program will have their reports \u201cprioritized\u201d in its moderation queue, and that it will respond to these reports within 48 hours. Schools that sign up will also get a \u201cschool partner\u201d badge appended to their Instagram account, along with in-app information about how to use its reporting tools and other resources.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Notably though, it doesn\u2019t so",

The first of those, the voice-activated Meeting Agent, can schedule follow-up calls and draft emails for you. It can also answer questions based on information it finds in your company&#39;s meeting database.</p>\n<p>&quot;This agent goes beyond simple transcription and empowers users to interact with AI meeting data in real-time to increase productivity,&quot; explains Otter.ai. The two other agents the company is releasing today can provide real-time coaching to sales agents during customer calls and live demos to potential customers.

There are more vlogging-specific models than ever, with several new models having arrived since our last guide, including Fujifilm\u2019s XM-5.<br><br>Recent vlogging-specific models include Sony\u2019s new ZV-E1 full-frame mirrorless that launched last year, DJI\u2019s Osmo Pocket 3 and Canon\u2019s compact PowerShot V10. Others in this guide, like the new Panasonic G9 II and Canon\u2019s EOS R6 II are hybrid mirrorless cameras that offer vlogging as part of a larger toolset.<br><br>Many have certain things in common, like flip-around screens, face- and/or eye-detect autofocus and stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we\u2019ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators, in all price ranges.
