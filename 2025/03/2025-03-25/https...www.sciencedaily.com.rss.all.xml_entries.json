In a recent study, researchers from Japan investigated factors influencing meal duration, including sex differences, chewing patterns, and rhythmic cues. Their findings suggest that eating more slowly -- by increasing chews per bite or using slow rhythmic cues -- may help reduce food intake. These insights could inform practical, low-cost obesity prevention strategies by promoting slower eating habits in daily life.",

The team confirmed the physical properties with stress-deformation tests and found that the treated foie gras had a similar mouthfeel to the original.",
