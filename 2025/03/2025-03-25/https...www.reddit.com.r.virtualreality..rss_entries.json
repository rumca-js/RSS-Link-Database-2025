But now, the Asus Flow Z13 2 in 1 tablet has appeared, powered by the new Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 &quot;Strix Halo&quot;, by AMD, which apparently is a real BEAST. </p> <p>Now, I don&#39;t know anything of these things, but given that it is an integrated all-in-one chip, does this mean that it could be used to power a standalone virtual reality headset somewhere in the future?</p> <p>I guess that right now such a device would be far to expensive, due to the pricing of the processor. But I guess that price will go down over time. So the other thing then would be heat and wattage, right? I mean, given that the processor can be tweaked to an acceptable wattage (maybe underclocked), and does not dissipate too much heat, such a headset, in my inexperienced head, sounds possible. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
