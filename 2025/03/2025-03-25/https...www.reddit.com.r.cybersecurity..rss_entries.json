The problem is that it focuses on big picture stuff and less on technical skills. I was wondering what kind of career outcomes I could be looking at if I go this route. By doing the program and completing technical training myself through certs etc could it lead to any decent positions? I looked up some of the alumni from the program on LinkedIn and saw that many are doing consulting work or something similar straight out of grad without an IT background. Is anyone currently doing Governance or GRC work that can give me some insight into the pipeline/pathway of this side of Cybersecurity?

I hate to spam the sub with more posts about the same thing, but felt this should be shared.</p> <p>1) The endpoint the TA stated they compromised is currently down. But there is a recent archive of it (Feb 17th) on the Wayback Machine: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250217171149/https://login.us2.oraclecloud.com/\">https://web.archive.org/web/20250217171149/https://login.us2.oraclecloud.com/</a></p> <p>2) The alleged vulnerability is CVE-2021-35587. It relates to the OpenSSO component of OAM (Oracle Access Manager). OpenSSO was deprecated in later 12c releases, but is fully available in 11g (see the Wayback Machine title? WELCOME TO ORACLE FUSION MIDDLEWARE 11g). Fun fact, 11g was deprecated in 2020.</p> <p>3) An interesting PoC for CVE-2021-35587 can be found here: <a href=\"https://testbnull.medium.com/oracle-access-manager-pre-auth-rce-cve-2021-35",

After that we: 1) Ask user what happened, start analyzing logs why it happened, from where it was downloaded, is it really malware 2) Usually it is some dumb thing which user downloaded from internet like some tool. 3) We force user to delete whatever he downloaded, check logs for any suspicious network, file creation or registry events. 4) Run AV few times and release device.</p> <p>So I wonder what approach is in other companies because maybe app downloaded was really malware and it got persistence, as I know if something like that happens we just force OS reinstall (maybe other procedures too) but what is first steps of response in other companies?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lightscream\"> /u/lightscream </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

The company is slightly larger than us, but not a F500 or even close.</p> <p>Super anxious and bummed, just went full time here a few months ago and the pay is so good, as are the people. Brushing up my resume and applying like crazy. Management says it will most likely be a \u201cgrowth\u201d opportunity for me, whatever that means.

We get audited based on absolute baseline minimum security requirements (NIST 37/60/53/30 CNSSI-1253/JSIG etc...) and move on with the minimum security requirements in order to accomplish said mission/capability. All coming to the hands of the audit/AO who almost inevitably accepts the security posture/risk of the system. </p> <p>My job was to facilitate this dance with the end goal of approval at almost any cost. Sometimes even knowing we were missing critical security best practices but did not have the time/resources/upper level support to implement.
