Dissolution is out today from Penguin Random House and we are absolutely stoked to bring you an excerpt from this sci-fi techno thriller to celebrate its release. Binge will have you travelling through time and memory with Maggie as she battles to save her husband from whoever has been stealing Stanley&#8217;s memories. If she does what she is told they can go back to their normal life, but Maggie might be risking more than just the memory of their lives together. The very course of human history hangs in the balance.
