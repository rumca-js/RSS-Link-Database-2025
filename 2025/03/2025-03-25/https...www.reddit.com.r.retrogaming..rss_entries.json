I noticed the box for the game had an old personal label on it with a name and a town/state, so I figured that might be the original owner. </p> <p>Well I was bored at the computer a couple days later with the box on my desk, so I googled the information on the personal label... and some ancient news blurbs popped up from the 90s about that person (same name, same town) being the victim of a home invasion and violent assault (the person survived).</p> <p>The game has nothing in particular to do with the crime other than that the victim was the owner of the game, and since it happened only a few years after the game came out, it was probably in their house during the crime... I don&#39;t feel like the game is cursed or that I immediately need to sell it, but damn, I&#39;m probably going to think about that more than a few times. I&#39;m glad the owner survived the crime and I genuinely hope that person is doing well",

Then eventually when it stops and you select a game it goes off.</p> <p>Does anyone know what could possibly be wrong? I have attached pics of PCB and a video showing what I am talking about.
