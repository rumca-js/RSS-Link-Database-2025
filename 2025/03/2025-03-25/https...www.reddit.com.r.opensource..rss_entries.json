This is a small story about my journey so far:<br/> A few months ago, I started developing my own open-source service mesh with the goal of making it fast, lightweight, and suitable for both cloud and edge devices. After months of testing, I\u2019ve built a decent foundation, implementing the core functionalities of traditional service mesh such as communication, sidecar proxies, service discovery, and metrics export. Right now, I\u2019m transitioning from a traditional proxy-based service mesh to a kernel-based approach using eBPF. My plan is to gradually rebuild all the functionalities and ensure everything works smoothly before adding more features, including advanced metrics, policies, and optimizations.</p> <p>The journey is still long and full of difficulties but I&#39;m very excited to see the results!<br/> For those curi",

It\u2019s an open-source attempt to bridge the gap between beautifully designed resumes and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).<br/> Right now, ATS often struggle with PDFs, leading to misinterpretation or outright rejection of resumes.

The goal is to spark discussion and (hopefully) get resume builders, HR tech, and ATS companies to align on a common standard.
