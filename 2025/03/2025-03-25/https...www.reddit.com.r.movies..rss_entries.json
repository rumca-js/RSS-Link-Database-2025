When watching movies before, I used to get so deeply immersive that I&#39;d silently mutter to myself: &quot;Why did he do that? He&#39;ll regret it, what happens next?&quot; I noticed my grandmother does the same - I inherited this mindset from her, constantly regretting even the smallest things in life. But while rewatching some films recently, something suddenly hit me. Especially in \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d, where Evan tried to eliminate regrets by changing the past, but fell into a more tragic cycle. The mother&#39;s final advice is: &quot;Some things are better left forgotten.&quot; This has started shifting my perspective. I should keep moving forward instead of always regretting the facts that cannot be changed. Some regrets have to become regrets as they are to truly define life.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kahnkahn022",

I don&#39;t find it slow at all. I love the pace of the opening and the wedding sequence. It feels like a documentary. It gives us time to get comfortable with the characters as real human beings, not just movie characters. The acting is so naturalistic. Every scene in Clariton feels very much like an Altman ensemble film with its wandering camera, overlapping dialogue and the very naturally realistic acting style. The characters aren&#39;t given big monolgues to express themselves, they do it all in a look. Character interaction and quick expressive moments build the characters and their stories without pandering to the audience. It&#39;s an exceptionally subtle piece of filmmaking. The fact that Michael and Nick are in love with the same woman is pretty clearly set up in the wedding sequence. Nick is very often framed with a ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m not a huge Tom Cruise fan, he&#39;s done some good films, shadowed by his involvement with Scientology, but whatever. He&#39;s a decent actor.</p> <p>I was channel surfing and came across this first Jack Reacher movie. So, first of all, I don&#39;t understand the criticism that he wasn&#39;t this huge muscle-bound macho guy. He played the role well and was a good fit for it, I thought.</p> <p>Most of all, holy Hell! This was a great movie. A solid thriller with a well-thought mystery behind the premise. There was enough action to keep it moving along, without going over the top, and only one car chase scene, which had a funny conclusion. That&#39;s Pittsburgh for you!</p> <p>I&#39;d watch it again and if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s worthwhile.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mildOrWILD65\"> /u/mildOrWILD65 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jj7jdz/jack_reache",
