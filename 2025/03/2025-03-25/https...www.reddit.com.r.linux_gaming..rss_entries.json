I wonder if there is a headset with a similar price range, doesn&#39;t need to be a flashy gamer one, i&#39;m a bit ear-injured so having some tweaking capabilities would be amazing and a microphone incorporated as well as wireless so i can stay connected to conversations even though i might not be just in front of my monitor.</p> <p>I&#39;m not picky in terms of brands, but I believe steelseries could be an option? may be corsair hs80? Then again, I am not that into headset knowledge, so i am mainly looking for more versed and properly verified feedback options.</p> <p>Thanks!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",
