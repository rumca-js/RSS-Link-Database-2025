You all like cute puppers, ri--wait, I&#39;m on what subreddit? </p> <p>Welp, time to pivot to gameplay. A few years back we launched (right into a pandemic, woo!) Good Puppers, a game I designed with a specific goal in mind: A cute game that was accessible to casual gamers, kids, family - but with enough potential strategy to make it a fun experience for more serious gamers. It&#39;s a game with cute dog art that you can play on autopilot, randomly selecting cards and letting things happen - and you&#39;ll score some points and have a good time. But you can plan and scheme to score many more points! </p> <p>We are back with more - Good Puppers Too is a standalone sequel/expansion, with more cards, the ability to play on its own or combine games, and it comes with two <strong>solo modes</strong>. One solo mode involves automa-style players that you can play against yourself - or even add to a normal gam",

An interesting idea is lack of misses on dice; you always get either damage or explosive damage (which allows extra roll - symbolizes a series of quick strikes), or a block (will prevent the damage and then turn into energy, which can be later spent on activating superpower). Feels more rewarding from player point of view. Moreover, there are several types of defense: each helps against the corresponding type of attacks.

I enjoyed it but don\u2019t remember it too well or why we sold it other than I have too many games. </p> <p>Does the expansion add meaningful depth or just take away from the elegance? I like the older art so now seems like best time to decide to rebuy it. We also have Orl\u00e9ans and Altiplano.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BoardGameRevolution\"> /u/BoardGameRevolution </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jj9kyz/does_the_alchemist_expansion_for_quacks_add_depth/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jj9kyz/does_the_alchemist_expansion_for_quacks_add_depth/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I think it absolutely will be divisive, and you\u2019ll react to it strongly, particularly if you\u2019re used to the OG style. However, the art extends well beyond the cover art, and I\u2019ve gotta say that the art on the ingredients and the ingredient books, and the expansion content all really work well. Bright, colorful, very legible. On the Herb Witches cards the characters on the cover of the box feature prominently, but they work much better in more \u201cbrightly lit\u201d contexts.
