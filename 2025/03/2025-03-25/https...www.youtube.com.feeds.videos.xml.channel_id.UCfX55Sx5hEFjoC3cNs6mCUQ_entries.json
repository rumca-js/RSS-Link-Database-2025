        "description": "The Linux Foundation\u2019s LF Broadband initiative is addressing the growing demand for scalable, cost-effective broadband infrastructure through open software and industry collaboration. With enterprises and residential users consuming and generating vast amounts of data, broadband networks must adapt to keep pace. The industry is also undergoing a significant transformation due to the shift toward disaggregated, open source solutions that separate hardware from software.\n\nArpit Joshipura, GM and SVP of Networking, Edge, and IoT at the Linux Foundation, explains how disaggregation is transforming broadband access by shifting from traditional Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) systems to 10-Gigabit Symmetric Passive Optical Network (XGS-PON) and beyond.",
