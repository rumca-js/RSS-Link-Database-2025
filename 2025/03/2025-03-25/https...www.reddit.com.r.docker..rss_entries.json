The idea is simple\u2014you build your image locally or in CI/CD, push it to a private registry, and it just runs. If you add <code>_autodeploy</code> in the label, the container will automatically restart with the new image. No need for extra scripts or manual restarts.</p> <p>I\u2019m letting people try it out for free\u2014mostly because I want to see how it holds up in different use cases. If it works for you and you need it longer, just let me know, and I\u2019ll extend access.</p> <p>Curious to hear how others handle their personal projects or quick deployments.
