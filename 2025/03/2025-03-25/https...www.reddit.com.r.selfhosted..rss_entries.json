I\u2019ve had a Plex server for a couple years and I just started hosting audiobookshelf on the back end of an Ubuntu server. I was wondering if there was a way to automate the download of certain YouTube channels videos? Say in a manner of speaking, you can \u2018subscribe\u2019 to a certain YouTube channel and then something like Ytdlp scans the channel every hour looks for new content, and when new content is discovered it downloads them and adds them automatically to something like Plex. Like I said, I\u2019m pretty new to this and any help is appreciated.

My extern hdd wich i use to store videos etc is since a few days saying it has an i/o error. Now im trying to copy the data and i made good progress. But now i just wanted to ask if somebody knows a better solution then copying the data with fastcopy for exampel. I copy the data, if the error occurs i need to reconnect the hdd the windows says it needs repair (the drive) i repair it and then it worls for a few copys sometimes more sometimes less. I think i copied the important data but some of the files are still on the drive. I just wanted to know if there is a better solution then just copy when error occurs reconnent repair and copy again. I tried to maken an iso but that just aborts everytime. And i dont have a drive thats large enpugh to make an image of the 4 tb with clonezilla. Is there a way to force the drive to copy all of tje data but i think even clonezilla wouldnt make it couse of if i woul",
