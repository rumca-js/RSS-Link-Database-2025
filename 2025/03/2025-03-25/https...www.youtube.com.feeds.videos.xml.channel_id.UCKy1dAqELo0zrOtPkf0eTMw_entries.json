However, Ubisoft has not released sales figures (yet), and cautions that Shadows' sales performance shouldn't be compared to the last mainline AC game, Valhalla, which was released at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when everyone was staying home and playing games anyway. Shadows instead should be compared to Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Origins, and Mirage, which was the most recent release before Shadows. In other news, two major games just received big updates\u2014Monster Hunter Wilds is getting its first big patch, and Civilization 7 has a new update that addresses much-needed quality-of-life issues.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
