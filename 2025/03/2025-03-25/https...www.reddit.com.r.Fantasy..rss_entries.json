Now for those who know, I have constantly been recommending the <strong><em>Tide Child Trilogy</em></strong> to any who ask for suggestions that I feel the series fills. That said, I have been doing this solely on the strength of the first book, <strong><em>The Bone Ships</em></strong>, which is another book I haven&#39;t made a review for. To summarize, I adored the first book and came to love both Joron Twiner and &quot;Lucky&quot; Meas Gilbryn, as well as the Hundred Isles.

What I like about Geralt: he is mature but doesn&#39;t feel too old (naturally because of magic); he is not trying to save the world and does not play the hero all the time (although truth be told he does occasionally); he is more neutral in general than a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; person; he is a skillfull fighter; he acts rationally and does not play stupid games; he does not talk shit...</p> <p>Those are just some character traits I liked and I of course don&#39;t expect them all to be present.</p> <p>Again I am looking for something in the same direction so give me your best recs. It can be single or multi POV. Magic is always appreciated. (I felt like Geralt had too weak magic abilities tbh).

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello good readers ! I am looking for fantasy books where the overarching theme and/or the main plot revolves around music. I have no other requirements it could be anything : 1. The main character could be a bard / have things to do with music / instruments 2. Music based magic systems 3. Music is used as a curse / break a curse 4. Characters bond over music 5. Music is important in that world / precious/sacred / has significant influence and interacts with the plots as if it is a character itself Please let me know if you find anything:) Thank you !</p> <p>P.S : I have read the Kinglkiller Chronicles and that is what inspired this post. I am open to similar recommendations or something completely different as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrifleAccording7212\"> /u/TrifleAccording7212 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jjb39y/books_themed_on_music/\">[link",
