The briefing just before the preview session began mentioned a lot of different elements at once: 20-person multiplayer, space exploration, two types of combat, procedurally generated worlds, and the list goes on. If even one of these elements didn't deliver, the entire experience will be worse for it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Somehow, Wildgate sticks the landing so far. The ability to seamlessly shift between exploration and combat is impressive, progression feels earned rather than forced, and the format lends itself to all sorts of different strategies based on the players joining you on the expedition. After playing a few matches against both AI and human opponents, Wildgate is showing some real promise as the next big multiplayer experience.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.gamespot",
