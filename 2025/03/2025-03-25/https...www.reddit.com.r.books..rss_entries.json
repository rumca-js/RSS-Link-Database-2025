The pacing of the book&#39;s first half is tedious, but when we get to the second half, some of the survival elements are breezed through, and some are just improbable.

He experiments with it and pushes boundaries of the genre. What if you know who the killer is, but don&#39;t know why he has done it. As you get to know the complex relationship the 2 main characters have, the motives kind of unspool.<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">As we read each &quot;confession&quot;, the story twists into unexpected threads.

Especially since most people I know who are into this sort of thing absolutely have the classics covered. My partner decided to ask me why I&#39;m not focusing on &quot;the classics&quot; and that if he were in charge of the system, he&#39;d be focusing on &quot;the classics&quot;.</p> <p>I disagreed. Historical importance aside, to me, a book is a book. Many hold a great deal of wonderful stories and messages, but some happened to be made at an earlier time. Many of them made by white, middle-to-upper-class white men. Not to say that their ideas were not important or their stories not good, but I do not base my love for reading around them or my love for books.</p> <p>Am I crazy for thinking that &quot;the classics&quot; have no more literary importance than somethin",

These books are practically invisible to me and I just gloss over them, until my eye catches something mildly interesting out of a million shitty book covers. </p> <p>The problem is, some of those are great books that are held in high regard, that I might enjoy a lot. I&#39;m very aware of publishers putting shitty covers on some amazing books, but I just can&#39;t get over it, it&#39;s extremely off-putting to me.
