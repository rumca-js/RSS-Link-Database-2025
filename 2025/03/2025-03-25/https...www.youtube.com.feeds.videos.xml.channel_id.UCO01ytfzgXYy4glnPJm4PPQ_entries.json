        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a government employee in Pennsylvania claimed she was the victim of a racist incident involving a noose. Surprising no one, it turns out it was a hoax \u2014 like literally every other racist noose incident this century. Also, we\u2019ll discuss a shocking story in Colorado of a teacher who essentially claimed custody over one of her gender-confused students, even as her actual parents desperately try to get the child back. Plus, the war on Teslas continues, as the Tesla vandals get dumber by the day.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:25 Opening\n02:16 - 21:59 This May Be The Dumbest Hate Crime Hoax Yet\n23:26 - 32:30 LGBT Activist Teacher, Trans Husband House Minor Teen Girl Against Mom\u2019s Wishes\n32:31 - 43:37 Man Keys Tesla Outside An Olive Garden\n43:38 - 50:58 Influencer Racks Up 700 Million Views For His Morning Routine\n52:42 - 1:02:28 The People In My Comments Defending The Behemoth Welfare State Are Canceled\n\nEp.1562\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gm0uN_tXIAAqQV",
