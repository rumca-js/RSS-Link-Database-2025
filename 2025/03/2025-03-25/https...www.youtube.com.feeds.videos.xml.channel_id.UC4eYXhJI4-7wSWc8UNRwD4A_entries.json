        "description": "Lara Downes | March 25, 2025\nCarlos Simon descends from three generations of preachers. His great-grandfather was ordained in 1924; his grandfather and father both followed at the pulpit. Carlos grew up in Atlanta, where family life revolved around the weekly rhythm of his father's church: Monday night was Bible study, Thursday night was choir rehearsal, Saturday was for cleaning the church and mowing the grass. By the time he was 10, Carlos was playing the piano for Sunday services.\n\nThat deep-in-the-DNA gospel was the foundation for his musical life, as a keyboardist and music director for artists like Angie Stone and Jennifer Holliday, and as a composer whose work for both concert stage and film uses a distinctive blend of gospel, jazz and unabashedly romantic influences.\n\nIt's a fascinating thing to watch a composer develop an authentic voice in real time, and I've had the pleasure of knowing Carlos long enough to witness his process of locking into a sound that is uniquely his.
