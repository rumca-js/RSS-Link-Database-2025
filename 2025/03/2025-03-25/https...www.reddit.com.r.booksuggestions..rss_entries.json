For those who haven&#39;t read it - Park, the author, writes about her experience of escaping North Korea, and details her life at each stage of her before, after, and during her escape, while also giving insight into the general culture/anthropology of North Korea.</p> <p>I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations that were similar. I was really fascinated by the sort of... not sure how to articulate it, but the social aspects the book - rather than the actual wilderness survival. I would definitely be interested in books about escaping cults, or something similar! </p> <p>I also was very invested in &quot;I&#39;m Glad My Mom Died&quot; by Jeanette McCurdy, as another example.

I get easily agitated sitting in one spot reading for a prolonged time so I recently found my local library has free audiobooks on their website. These have been absolutely amazing. I love audiobooks because I can multitasking. I often listen to them while walking home from school or doing my night routine. My question is how could I help myself remember what I have read/listened to? I keep a log book of what books I&#39;ve finished and I rate them. But I&#39;ve found a lot of them time I struggle to rate them because I barely remember the story/writing style/things I liked or disliked. So far I&#39;ve just had the idea to make a bullet point list of the things listed above. Any other suggestions or is this a too hyperspecific question? lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/anon56_ymous\"> /u/anon56_ymous </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

I grew up an avid reader, but a few years ago hit a string of books that didn\u2019t interest me/lost time because of college and stopped reading (also feel like my attention span sadly diminished\u2026thanks social media!). I want to get back into reading but have found it hard because since my third year of high school the ONLY books I read for recreation were classic lit. I became a huge classic lit nerd after a literature class in high school and that was the only thing I read for a few years\u2026fast forward to now, and anything NOT classic lit reads like Cocomelon or just incredibly cringe to me. I love horror, mystery, anything dark/spooky, but also love dry humor. Some of my favorite books are As I Lay Dying, Catcher in the Rye, Dracula, Clockwork Orange, Rebecca (I told you I only read classic lit for a few years!) I\u2019m open to recs that are either classic lit or modern lit. ",
