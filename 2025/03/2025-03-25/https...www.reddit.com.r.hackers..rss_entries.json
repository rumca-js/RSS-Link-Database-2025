Some dick cheese sommelier got hold of my password manager and has gone through the effort of fucking up almost all of my accounts online. I\u2019ve been going through and changing my passwords on everything and the biggest damage done was a $400 Australian doordash order on an old credit card. I live in the US and don\u2019t know how to address this legally. Like I\u2019ve got the fuckers address and the doordash guy took a crude picture of him digging through the bags so I figure I could do something but idk how or where to report something like this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jesusofthebible\"> /u/jesusofthebible </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1jjuudp/i_got_hacked_from_a_guy_in_australia/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1jjuudp/i_got_hacked_from_a",

They mentioned some program called Pegasus and apparently installed it a few months ago bc im apparently neglegent on the internet.</p> <p>Would they be capable of using my IP or whatever to doctor searches on my device, as in obviously i dont watch the shit they&#39;re accusing me of, but can they make it look that way? Or are they even for real? Coz some of the language doesnt sound very aware of my life except for the simple fact they somehow sent me an email with my own email. Just doesnt make sense how it ended up in my junk folder. </p> <p>Apparently they&#39;re monitoring all my activity so maybe these supposed videos will end up being somewhere or everywhere.
