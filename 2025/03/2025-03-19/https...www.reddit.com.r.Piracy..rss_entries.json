I don&#39;t need to have any data. I largely just got it to pair with my smart watch. So I&#39;m here asking, is my phone limited at all with it not being activated?

I&#39;ve heard people say their phones are listed as stolen when things like this happen, even when you actually bought it. If it&#39;s listed as stolen, and I call them, are they able to lock the phone completely? Should I not call them to try and get this resolved?</p> <p>I don&#39;t know if this constitutes piracy, but this is the only place I could ",
