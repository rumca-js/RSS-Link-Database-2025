I\u2019m at a family friend\u2019s house, stuck at a dinner that feels like it will never end. The adults are talking about boring grown-up stuff, and I\u2019m just waiting for something interesting to happen. Then, one of the hosts asks me if I want to play a board game.</p> <p>They pull out a box, and it\u2019s not just a game \u2013 it\u2019s an adventure. I remember it had ruins, treasure, maybe an Indiana Jones vibe, and I believe the board was set up directly in the box. It was a temple from inside and you roamed around, my memories are fogged up. It was long and square-shaped, and I swear there were traps or something exciting happening. In my childhood memory, it was the coolest game ever.</p> <p>Fast forward to today: I\u2019m a full-on board game nerd, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what this game was.

He\u2019s the guy behind many popular titles like Acquire, Bazaar, Sleuth, <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/364/samarkand\">Samarkand</a>, Can&#39;t Stop, I&#39;m the Boss!, and BuyWord, all of which have stood the test of time, and hold up surprisingly well alongside modern games. Gryphon Games has been producing new editions of many of Sackson&#39;s games, and one of their recent releases is <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/376665/samarkand-bazaar\">Samarkand Bazaar</a>, which contains three excellent Sackson titles in one box: Bazaar, Samarkand, and Samarkand Market.</p> <p>In this review I\u2019m covering <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/364/samarkand\"><strong>Samarkand</strong></",

I\u2019ll be playing mostly solo, but sometimes with my partner, so having a game that works well at both player counts is important.</p> <p>The big factor for me is that I\u2019d prefer to play in a language other than English, but there\u2019s a significant difference in available content: \u2022 Arkham Horror LCG has only one expansion available in my language. \u2022 Lord of the Rings LCG has three expansions available.</p> <p>However, the most important thing for me is variability.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mind replaying a scenario, but I really want each session to feel fresh and unpredictable. I\u2019m worried about the gameplay becoming too repetitive\u2014whether it\u2019s due to the encounter decks, the way challenges play out, or the overall structure of the game.</p> <p>So my main concerns are: 1.
