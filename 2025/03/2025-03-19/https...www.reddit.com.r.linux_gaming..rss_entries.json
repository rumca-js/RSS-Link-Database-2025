I am looking to use a WiiMote Plus as a mouse with IR, specifically on Steam Deck. Through Steam, a WiiMote can be connected as a bluetooth controller and every button is supported, but the internal gyro and of course the IR tracking are not read by Steam, or by Linux as far as I&#39;m aware. On Windows I used to use TouchMote and an USB sensor bar to do just that, but on Linux documentation is very confusing and kinda technical, I&#39;ve found some solutions that need to be compiled, that are very old, and I get that Linux is not a system where you do two clicks and you&#39;re done but this is hard for casual users. I was hoping for some detailed instructions on how to get it working, if it&#39;s even possible nowadays. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HELLBENT42\"> /u/HELLBENT42 </a> <br/> <sp",

Everything has been rather smooth for the most part, save for one major thing. If I can get this working, then it will heavily weigh my thoughts of swapping over to &quot;the penguin&quot; for gaming. Is there any way to get the Cyborg II to work with Linux? I know in the past people have used AntimicroX to achieve what I am looking for, but when I try to use it, the software recognizes the device, but the device is completely unresponsive. So I turn the question to the community, is there maybe something extra that I have to do to get this functional, or am I just wasting my time with something like this? Again, I&#39;m rather new to Linux, so please go easy with the comments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/painlesslybasic\"> /u/painlesslybasic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lin",

I know that the new ones are available if you spend time learning how to install them, but that sounds like you need to do a work around which might cause the drivers to not be stable? If that&#39;s incorrect then please tell me. </p> <p>I use a gaming laptop, I have it mostly on dGPU only mode, but sometimes I might wanna switch if I know I&#39;ll be away from the charger for a bit, I&#39;m assuming there are no problems switching back and forth on Linux but I wanna make sure that there isn&#39;t. </p> <p>What is the best distro to use for gaming?
