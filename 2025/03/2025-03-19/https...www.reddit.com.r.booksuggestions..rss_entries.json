So I was a huge reader as a kid, but around middle school I stopped reading (like many do) and as hard as I tried to get back into it, it was just such a struggle (for various reasons) to get back in. I recently finished grad school and got a job at a library and it has totally reignited my passion for reading. </p> <p>However now that it&#39;s been so long, I&#39;m really looking for lots of suggestions! I&#39;ve recently finished The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker and Kindred by Octavia Butler, and am now reading Parable of the Sower by Butler. I&#39;m really interested in horror, history, sociology, dragons, and urban fantasy but not so much romance. Anything relevant to our current political climate as well. I&#39;m super open to any suggestions and I appreciate every one!!! Thank you :)</p> <p>(If it helps any, here&#39;s some books and authors I was a huge fan of back in the day: Narnia, Percy Jackson, Edgar Allan Poe, Twilight, Warr",

I&#39;m looking for a suggestions on adventure-based science fiction, but with some specifics:</p> <p>Year after year my favorite genre has been science fiction combined with travel, but the literature of the twentieth century hit me like a train, with all of the experience of living when the world was just being explored and geographical details were as fascinating to the reader as a fairy tale.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to all languages or historical period, but the key factor - the author provides as many scientifical - geographical, medical, biological etc - facts as humanly possible! </p> <p>Examples of what I&#39;m looking for: 20.000 leagues under the sea (and, honestly, almost everything out of Jules Verne works), Tomek in the landof kangaroos (and other series), works of Arthur Conan Doyle, aside from Sherlock&#39;s adventures, of course etc. Very glad for all kinds of suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

Looking for a female lead, character driven book with elements of war, angst, and violence. If the FMC is morally grey, that would be awesome. I would like a little romance as long as its well written and preferably a slow burn, but its fine if its not the main plot. I am okay with no HEA\u2019s. Hoping there are books out there like this\ud83d\ude4f (or do i just have to write it myself) (I\u2019ve read ToG, The Cruel Prince, currently reading The Poppy War, and Red Rising is on my list) Thank you!!</p> <p>Edit: Im okay with books that aren\u2019t exactly like this, just really want a morally grey fmc who is the main plot. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/love_dove7812\"> /u/love_dove7812 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jezumj/need_a_book_rec/",

When he spoke to Stoner about literature I felt like he was speaking to me. Sloane dedicates his life to literature and doesn&#39;t even have a family. I had a really tough childhood filled with trauma and my love of literature pulled me through I&#39;m in my mid twenties now and it&#39;s because of Sloane I&#39;ve realised how important literature has been to me all these years, it&#39;s my lifeline. I studied law at university and already have a Masters since I want to be a lawyer and I&#39;m still sticking to that but I feel a burning passion to pursue Literature even doing another Masters if I have to. Anyway those are just my thoughts I needed to get it off my chest because I&#39;ve never had a character speak to me in a way that&#39;s made me learn something so profound about myself. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",

My criticism is that there is too much telling (and rambling) and not enough plot. Obviously, if you love him I&#39;m happy, but the last thing I want to feel when reading horror is boredom.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to any 3rd person horror. Preferably, more action, more tense moments, life threatening situations. Trying to move from a lover of horror movies to scary fiction. I love a good slasher.</p> <p>Give me those scenes where a survivor is &quot;-&quot; away from the danger. The tingle down your spine when you&#39;re reading in bed at night. Twists and turns. Supernatural preferred.</p> <p>Just thought there may be some in here who also didn&#39;t vibe with his writing, but then found an author that did :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SetitheRedcap\"> /u/Setithe",

I&#39;ve been craving some good horror with scientific elements and a gothic feel (something a bit like frankenstein, or maybe some biological fungal aspects to it). I would like it to be actually scary though. Wouldn&#39;t mind if there were some Hannibal or A Cure for Wellness vibes.
