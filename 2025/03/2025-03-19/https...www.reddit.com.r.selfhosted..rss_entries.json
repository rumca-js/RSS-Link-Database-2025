I think it only has a 100mb ethernet port, at least that&#39;s what Ubuntu tells me, and when I try to use USB WiFi adapters, they don&#39;t run at their max speed, even on the network testing with iperf3, and the os just stops the WiFi adapter working every couple of hours until I reboot the whole system. This has meant only using ethernet which is annoying because currently I have to use powerline connectors, but even if I plugged the system right into the router, the ethernet port would be the limiting factor. Is it just time to upgrade? And if so is there a particular processor generation that was a big leap for a media server that I should look out for?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/greenmonkeyglove\"> /u/greenmonkeyglove </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:",

Also at the start of the audio the voice always breaks. </p> <p>I would like some insights in the current best voice cloning ai tool.

When trying to connect from my phone i get cloudflare error 522. I enabled https (self-signed) in nextcloud just to get it using 443. nginx-proxy-manager still gives &quot;internal error&quot; when trying to get a ssl cert.</p> <p>I am stuck on what is breaking the chain. Is there a tool or command I can use to follow the path until it breaks? Also any advice on what is likely causing the problem would be great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Ad7106\"> /u/Accomplished_Ad7106 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jemmb0/reverse_proxy_throug",
