There's been a big rework to the Intel CPU model handling within the Linux kernel given that \"Family 6\" has been in use since the 1990s and moving forward Intel CPUs will appear in Family 19 like Diamond Rapids along with Family 18 as part of the new CPU identification. Thus a lot of Linux kernel checks need to be reconfigured for the multi-family Intel handling. With Linux 6.15 it looks like most of that will be finally wrapped up...",

In addition, AMD is now offering more robust container options for easier Instinct compute deployments with more software options available and being more regularly updated.",
