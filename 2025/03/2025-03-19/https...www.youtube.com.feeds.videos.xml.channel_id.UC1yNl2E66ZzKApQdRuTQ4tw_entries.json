First 30 days are free and 20% off the annual premium subscription when you use our link \u279c  https://brilliant.org/sabine. \n\nPhysicists have come up with a new idea for how our universe began, and it could also explain dark matter. They say that if our universe has small extra dimensions, then these can temporarily store energy, causing a \u201ccosmological stasis\u201d in which the universe expands but nothing else happens. Then the stasis ends and dark matter remains. Sounds wild. What are we to make of this?\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join this channel t",
