I recently digitized about 20 VHS tapes I made as a teenager in the 1990&#39;s of alternative MTV stuff, mainly 120 Minutes, Alternative Nation, a few MTV Video Music Awards, and selected MTV News segments. I tried uploading some of them on the Internet Archive but most were taken down due to copyright claims. Looking for any sites that would appreciate me making actual torrents of what I have.
