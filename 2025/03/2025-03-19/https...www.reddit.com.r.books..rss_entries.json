She\u2019s such a badass and she knows it. Then the author decides that her happy ending is her finding a mate(that part can be totally fine) and getting pregnant, raising kids and leaving all the action behind. I would think these strong independent female characters would want to live for themselves and would want to spend the rest of their days exploring and continuing being a wise old badass. Why does it have to be of them having kids and stopping their passion? Why can\u2019t it be of them continuing to be free and strong even in their 50s or 60s?

As someone who is at the end of my high school years, I found this book in my school library and had figured it would be best to educate myself on the troubled American youth that &quot;popularized&quot; and snowballed the pandemic of school shootings.</p> <p>This book was very informative and helpful in my understanding of what had happened back on April 20th, 1999, since I had barely known any details of what happened that day. I didn&#39;t even know Columbine was in Colorado!</p> <p>While this book was informative, it was incredibly sad and disturbing. Definitely not something you read hoping to hear about cats and rainbows (though, this was obvious). From the detailed ways these young men planned out their attack, to what they did to their victims, what they said when they let out their rage into journals or online, this book made my heart hurt for the families involved and the victims.</",
