Software engineers scoff at the idea of new code instantly becoming legacy code, however software is a time capsule holding the design trends of the time the code was written. As new code is written, new design trends are used and potentially overused, just like the legacy patterns. What if these new design trends have more in common with the original design trends than we initially thought. One example we will investigate is object oriented design through polymorphism and how it has been replaced in many cases with template metaprogramming. There are a variety of template metaprogramming strategies that achieve the object oriented design principles, however when overused you can encounter as many templates as there would be virtual functions in object oriented programming.
