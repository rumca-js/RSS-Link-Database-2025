        "description": "Sponsored by Linux Foundation Education & Arm Education\n\nYou won\u2019t believe how fast this is! Join us for an insightful webinar on leveraging CPUs for machine learning inference using the recently released, open source KleidiAI library. Discover how KleidiAI's optimized micro-kernels are already being adopted by popular ML frameworks like PyTorch, enabling developers to achieve amazing inference performance without GPU acceleration. We'll discuss the key optimizations available in KleidiAI, review real-world use cases, and demonstrate how to get started with ease in a fireside chat format, ensuring you stay ahead in the ML space and harness the full potential of CPUs already in consumer hands. This Linux Foundation Education webinar is supported under the Semiconductor Education Alliance and sponsored by Arm.",
