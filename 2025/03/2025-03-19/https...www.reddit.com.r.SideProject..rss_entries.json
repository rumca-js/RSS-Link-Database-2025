These tasks were &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot; but were not evenly distributed. This would sort of clog up the celery queue for whatever work load that was, and sometimes made it take hours or days for a smaller job to start let alone finish.</p> <p>I threw together (with some AI help) an extension on Python Celery to help mitigate some of those concerns. It uses an LRU that lets you give a key and weight to a given task. Instead of putting the task directly into a celery queue, it puts a prioritization task that pulls the highest-priority task from the queue and runs that instead. It comes with a lot of bells and whistles.</p> <p>If anyone wants to test it out, let me know!</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/teleos-consulting/celery-ranch\">https://github.com/teleos-consulting/celery-ranch</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",
