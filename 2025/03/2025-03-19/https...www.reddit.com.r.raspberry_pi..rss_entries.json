I was in the process of trying to figure out how to remove input lag by using the &quot;Run Ahead&quot; feature of the emulation to increase the frames. I have figured how to do this but, in the process, I was fiddling with a lot of different settings.</p> <p>The first thing I did was go to Port 1 controls in the emulation station settings and clicked on \u201cSet All controls\u201d I started pushing all kinds of button prompts to back out of this window and ended up completely changing the controller configuration of my 8bit Duo Pro controller, which as you imagined, made it impossible for me to even navigate the menu\u2019s.
