I would imagine it&#39;s for games or whatever. For additional information she has a pc that&#39;s a i5 12400, 16gb ram, and an 8gb 3050, and a Nintendo switch. I don&#39;t know if they have stand alone VR sets or if her PC is even capable. Hoping to stay in the sub $500 range but I don&#39;t mind spending a little more if necessary. She&#39;s 10 doesn&#39;t need to be the latest greatest but would like something nice she can use for a while. </p> <p>Thanks for any info or direction on where to start looking. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sackamous\"> /u/Sackamous </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jew8a6/vr_recommendation_for_kids/\">[link]</a",

The game my friends want me to be able to play is VR chat, but I want to be sure I&#39;ll be able to play it and have all the worlds and such. I have a pretty okay PC I will wire it to. I&#39;ve tried reading multiple different threads and googling but I haven&#39;t found a solid answer. Ryzen 7 3700x 16Gb. Ddr4 ram RTX 3060 12gb GPU 1Tb SSD AND 256Gb SSD</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Several-Manager-8331\"> /u/Several-Manager-8331 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jekny2/quest2_through_pc_able_to_play_vr_chat/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jekny2/quest2_through_pc_able_to_play_vr_chat/\">[comments]</a></span>",
