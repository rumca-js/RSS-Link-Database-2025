I was considering switching to Duck Duck go, which however is great for privacy but maybe less accurate than Brave. Then I read about Start page, they say it is similar to Google&#39;s, however I am afraid regarding privacy.... what do you recommend between: </p> <p>- Brave search;</p> <p>- Duck duck go;</p> <p>- Start page.</p> <p>Of course, if you know of better ones than these, I am open to suggestions. Ideally, there should be a good combination of privacy and accuracy of results. I would like to avoid at all costs using Google</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BIGDomi98\"> /u/BIGDomi98 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1jezjt6/which_search_engine_do_you_recommend/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sea",
