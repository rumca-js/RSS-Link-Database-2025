From what I&#39;m seeing in the trailer, the dialogue feels surprisingly lifelike and emotive... way beyond the chatbots I&#39;ve messed with before. It kinda reminded me of Facade.</p> <p>I feel like this could be a really cool experiment in gaming. Obviously, AI in games is still super early, but I haven&#39;t seen anything quite like this before. </p> <p>What do you guys think about this?

I think AI can solve a lot of problems, and I dont think its a bad thing, however, I have anxiety and the negative thoughts are consuming me. How will people be able to keep an income or buy the things they love and want? I&#39;m sorry if this is super negative but I just worry.

So while Lovable and v0 and Cursor even do have many benefits, the fact that they are selling this FULL-STACK DREAM to completely non technical people is insane.</p> <p>Just saw today on Reddit how someone said they are stopping their public streaming efforts because their app and identity was basically being hacked as dude was doing his entire build without ever having touched a techjical operation and Cursor and/or him just leaked all sorts of API keys, etc.</p> <p>So think that for a moment. We now have non-technical people doing very technical things and that creates a massive security nightmare as it\u2019s not possible to have.
