Try, EA, Steam, Blizzard, Epic, Xbox app, Ubisoft Connect\u2026 I\u2019m getting dizzy just listing them off. In fact, my desktop is so cluttered with icons it looks like it has a bad case of computer measles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But worse than that is the fact that I only have a vague idea of where some of my games are. Not the classics of course. I\u2019d never misplace the <em>Skyrims</em> or <em>Diablo IVs</em>. But it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess where I\u2019d find the <em>Max Payne 3s</em> and <em>Battle Brothers</em> \u2014 do y\u2019all know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dilemma I\u2019m putting my finger on here is the fact there are just too many launchers in PC gaming and it\u2019s time something be done about it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-worst-thing-about-too-many-launchers\">The worst thing about too many launchers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so the two inconveniences I ju",

EcoSmart Universal Select Light Bulbs feature adjustable brightness and white color temperatures, but they\u2019re distinct from the company\u2019s growing Hubspace smart home ecosystem because they don\u2019t connect to Wi-Fi or any other smart home protocol. We\u2019ll call them semi smart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new bulbs will be available in A19, BR (bulged reflector), and PAR (parabolic aluminized reflector) form factors, with maximum outputs of 1600 and 1700 lumens respectively. Being unconnected bulbs, they can\u2019t be controlled with a smartphone app or integrated into any smart home ecosystem. Instead, their settings are changed by flipping physical switches embedded in the heatsinks between their lenses and bases.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data",
