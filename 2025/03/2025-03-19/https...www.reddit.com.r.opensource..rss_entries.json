It\u2019s not a fancy tool, it focuses on just one thing: generating tables using AI.</p> <p>You can easily define different LLM models and switch between them. It also supports batch generation of thousands of rows and allows you to use existing tables or CSV files as context. As the title suggests, you can use it via CLI, API, or WebUI!</p> <p>There are also some interesting examples of how to use Tablepilot:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Yiling-J/tablepilot/tree/main/examples/recipes_for_customers\">recipes_for_customers</a> This example illustrating how to use another table as a reference. The <code>customers.json</code> file is used to generate a customer table, and then the recipes table is generated based on customer data. Each customer will receive a unique recipe tailored to their information.</li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Yiling-J/tablepi",
