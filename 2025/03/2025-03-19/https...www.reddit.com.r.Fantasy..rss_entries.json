        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I started a series when I was a kid, back in the 90&#39;s. The main character was a 16 year old girl with red hair, who was good with fire magic. She grew up in the middle of the wilds with an earth witch and lived in a hollow tree. On her 16th birthday she went through a trial to become a witch, she had to pass a trial with earth, wind, Fire and Water. In this world witchcraft was illegal. That was the premise, and from there she was forced out of her home and had to go on a journey. I adored this book as a kid, and desperately wanted to finish the series, but it had not been written. I want to try rereading it, but I cannot remember what the book or the series is called! Can anyone help me out? </p> <p>Edit: it was the Witches of Eileanan</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Far-Contest683\"> /u/Far-Contest683 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jfasxw/can_anyone_help",

I find the idea of being forced to read something, having to be tested on it and so on and so forth disgusting. I tried reading some self development books in the past to get into the hobby by reading at least 10 pages a day buut I kind of put the book down after 80 pages. I am a huge fan of fantasy as a genre so one day with a voucher I had earned, I bought a book (The Poppy War by R. F. Kuang) and I read about 30 pages after which I left it on my desk for the next like 5 ish months. Then randomly at the end of February I started reading again. I don&#39;t know what happened but I finished all 527 pages in like a week or so. I found myself reading 50 pages a day like it was nothing, one day I even read 140 pages a day (might not be a lot but for me it sure was). Now I also bought The Dragon Republic to continue ",

I started back at the beginning a few days ago and I\u2019m 48% of the way through. Along the way I was asking myself why I didn\u2019t finish before because I was really enjoying it and now I remember. It\u2019s Binabik. One issue is the voice the narrator uses; it\u2019s incredibly annoying. The other, however, is the way Binabik talks. I can\u2019t stand the idiosyncratic syntax and that it\u2019s not even consistently used as the character speaks. That all said (and without spoilers) do I have to deal with this character for much longer? If he\u2019s not gone soon, which I don\u2019t think he will be, I\u2019m dropping the series.

I&#39;m drawn to darker narratives and slow-paced storytelling that thoroughly describes the world and setting. Magic isn&#39;t a major factor for me, so it&#39;s fine if it&#39;s minimal or subtle.</p> <p>Could you recommend similar fantasy series or authors? I&#39;d really app",

I would love to hear what other people that has finished the whole series think of it. I will summarize mine for each trilogy in order to keep the post short. Again Spoilers below. </p> <p>Farseer trilogy : I read this over 10 years ago so I don&#39;t remember too much detail but I remember really liking it and also never wanting to read anything like it or Robin Hobb ever again. </p> <p>Liveship Traders : Finally got the courage to read another Robin Hobb. I found the start of Ship of Magic incredibly dull and boring. However, after the initial pages could not put it down and finished it within a week. Thats when I decided to take up reading all of the Elderling books. Overall I really like the Liveship Traders. I might like it the best out of all of them. My only complaint is Kennit was mostly shown as manipulative and playing the long game. So suddenly raping Althea see",

The only things that I remember about the series is that the main character was a boy that was saved, when his entire family was executed by the evil ruler of the land.</p> <p>He ended up becoming a very powerful general, and he had these powers that he had to replenish by playing with these tiles that he would lay out in front of himself and play with. It was something about how it took his mind off of things and helped him focus.</p> <p>He also had this female assassin that was with him as he made his rise to power.
