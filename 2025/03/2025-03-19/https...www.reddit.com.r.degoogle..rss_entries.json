So, my question is, how do you usually use your de-Googled mobile phone? What I am most curious about is whether you have a SIM card inserted in that phone. Given the privacy concerns associated with SIM cards, I wonder if many people choose not to use them. I&#39;m interested in how those who do not have a SIM card are using their phones outside.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lambda7016\"> /u/lambda7016 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1jey1y0/how_do_you_usually_use_your_degoogled_phone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1jey1y0/how_do_you_usually_use_your_degoogled_phone/\">[comments]</a></span>",
