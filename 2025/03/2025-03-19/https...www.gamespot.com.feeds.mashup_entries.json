For those of a certain age, there's nothing more <em>expected </em>than the basics of how a 2D platformer and its level design work. <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/level-devil/\">Level Devil</a> knows this, and it's happy to give you and your expectations a giant middle finger with each and every level.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That might sound like a recipe for frustration, but instead my time with the game has been nothing if not consistently hilarious and delightful. Despite being someone who often finds the potential for lost progress in souls-likes to be off-putting, failing a level in Level Devil and incurring a similar level of setback elicits a hearty chuckle from me rather than an exasperated sigh.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5twphKwma04\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://ww",

Dick in 1968, and is considered one of the seminal works of the now-popular cyberpunk genre. Decades later, the dystopian sci-fi novel would become the basis for the iconic Ridley Scott's 1982 film, Blade Runner. Since then, the film's version of the story has been expanded with the 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049 and the upcoming Prime Video series Blade Runner 2099, set to release in 2025. The film has also inspired a series of official graphic novels that explore new corners of the cyberpunk setting.</p><p>One of the newest additions is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blade-Runner-Tokyo-Nexus-Peace/dp/1787738493?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Blade Runner: Tokyo Nexus</a>, which arrived in February and adds a whole new home planet to the Blade Runner universe.
