The company already knew that I have to attend reviews in college and do academics and then work too. They conducted a hackathon in my college and I got selected through that. But recently I just resigned because when I left for college final year project review for 2 days, they demanded I must complete the 2 days work in a single day and questioned my capability and so on and so forth. I am good at adapting. I was already working on the product for the whole week sleeping only 2 hours a day as the playstore release of the app was coming. I just resigned after the incident as my health was going down and started getting black eyes and couldn&#39;t even attend college activities. I was paid the compensation of an intern but was doing the work of a experienced person. Any thoughts?</p> <p>I have attached my resume.. I am pretty good at learning and unlearning fast. Fi",
