With up to 160 MB/s read speeds, you\u2019ll be able to quickly load games and apps. It can also reach up to 100 MB/s write speeds, so you\u2019ll be able to quickly transfer files from one device to another, save game data, and record video. In fact, it\u2019s fast enough to record 4K video without frame drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p",
