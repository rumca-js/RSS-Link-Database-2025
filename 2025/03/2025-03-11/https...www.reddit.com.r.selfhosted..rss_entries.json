SSO is important for me because my family cannot get their head around the concept of remembering more than a single password (or a Windows Hello PIN), and expect everything to &quot;just work&quot;. I like my passwords to be mine and the more <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/feds-link-150m-cyberheist-to-2022-lastpass-hacks/\">recent fallout</a> from the LastPass breach, to me, shows exactly why self-hosting your passwords is important.</p> <p>I had initially looked at BitWarden&#39;s Enterprise plan but it is a little pricy for home use at $6 / user / mo. I reached out to sales but they weren&#39;t able to provide a discount for homelabbing. Bitwarden is a great project, but lacks a little in this respect.</p> <p>I came across <a href=\"https://psono.com/\">Psono</a> &amp; wanted to share it with the community as it does",

I&#39;m looking for a replacement to the Chromecast Audio devices. I need it to be able to stream to multiple devices as once. I used to have wifi speakers that worked great, but one broke and were way too expensive to get replacements so I went with dumb speakers and Chromecast Audio because I knew it worked. I don&#39;t need a server, but a receiver and player. I&#39;ve thought about just putting a couple raspberry pi&#39;s there and playing music individually, but that would complicate things for my staff. There is a good 100ft between the speakers so I&#39;m not going to run wiring. There are cat5 jacks right where these go, so wired would be a plus!

There is <strong>Outline</strong> and a few others that look nice, but they&#39;re either really a <strong>Confluence</strong> alternative, not OneNote; or, in the case of Outline, I&#39;m not happy with the way it requires a 3rd party to sign-in. I want normal username/password, which they don&#39;t seem to support.</p> <p>I want something that has the same organization levels as OneNote (<em>Notebook -&gt; Section Group -&gt; Section -&gt; Tabs -&gt; Pages -&gt; Nested Pages</em>), and all visible in two sidebars like OneNote, easily Drag &amp; Drop pages to organize them, easily create a new page in between other pages, being able to Edit right away without pressing &quot;Edit&quot;, etc...</p",
