I just don&#39;t want it to be the primary driver of the plot and from the skimming I&#39;ve done from most popular Romantasy series I longed for better prose.</p> <p>I was recently in my local Indigo bookstore here in Toronto and I got overwhelmed with the Fantasy section. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s common practice at bookstores to combine Romantasy with general fantasy but it caused my eyes to glaze over as I walked the aisles. I beelined it towards the sections that contained authors I&#39;m familiar with like Sanderson, Hobb, Abercrombie ect ect... But I&#39;m left with a sense that I&#39;m missing out on new authors I would enjoy. It feels impossible to look at a cover, title or read the synopsis and walk away with a clear understanding of what you&#39;re about to walk into.</p> <p>Please, I&#39;d love some recommendations of newer books published i",

My personally all time favorites are the cult like magic system from the Silt Verses and the magic system from the Weirkey Chronicles. The Silt Verses is a Lovecraftian Horror Audio Drama following two characters pilgrimage down a river. Essentially their magic system is based around the fact that enough faith and sacrifice for one purpose/concept creates a god that&#39;s powers can be used if you a) channel it through a &quot;prayer mark&quot; or b) let the god take over your body and make you a &quot;saint.&quot; The magic system really drives the story especially in the first season and it is one of the more unique magic systems I&#39;ve seen. The weirkey chronicles is one I like for the sheer novelty of it. Essentially in this universe people are granted powers through a structure in their soul. Using certain types of building materials you can create a structure/tower in your souls to cultivate your progression. Designing a fl",

This would be an audiobook also. My first thoughts are: - Red Rising (although can drag and ends up being a massive space opera) - The Martian (maybe too much technical sciencey talk that would get boring) - Project Hail Mary (this one is probably top of the list especially for an audiobook) - The Will of the Many (pretty long and whilst I didn\u2019t find it slow I can see how it might be to a new reader)</p> <p>A standalone would be ideal, or a shorter series.

I find it almost impossible to review without spoilers because it&#39;s a mystery only 115 pages long. But I&#39;ll try.</p> <p>The good parts: The protagonist, Ulcetha Zhorvena, is very likeable. He&#39;s a nerdy scholar who has been expelled from his graduate school by a false accusation that he stole an important archaeological artifact called the Orb of Cairado. (Academic politics and rivalries are accurately described.) Ulcetha is now eking out a modest living forging provenances of real but unimportant artifacts for a shady antiques dealer. Ulcetha doesn&#39;t mind too much because his employer (Salathgarad) allows him to do interesting research to write up detailed provenances. Ulcetha also",
