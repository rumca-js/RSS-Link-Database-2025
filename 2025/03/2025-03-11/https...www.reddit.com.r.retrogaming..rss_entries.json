The stick figure was simple in design, but the environments were vibrant.</li> <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> The game featured various obstacles and platforms.

Each player started in one of the corners of the screen and took on the role of a soldier in green clothing. The screen was static and the map didn\u2019t move. The game was 2D, and the goal was to kill the other players or the opposing team, with only four soldiers on the map at a time, either bots or players, all playing on the same keyboard. At the beginning of the game, each player bought weapons (similar to CS:GO), and then had to shoot the enemies. When you managed to kill someone, you earned money for the next round&#39;s purchase. I also remember one map. On the right side, there was a building with a basement, and on the left, there was a pool with a large diving board. One player started on the roof of the building, another in the basement, one on top of the diving board, and the other below it. Does anyone know what game this is? Thank you very much for answers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

Finding those takes a lot of trial and error. The contests completely grind the game to a halt though. It\u2019s a really odd choice imo. It\u2019s not necessarily un-fun, but it just feels pointless. I found myself just wishing I could skip them and get back to actually playing the game. Overall I enjoyed it. The autoscroll and flying levels were a nice touch, as was the final vertical climb section.
