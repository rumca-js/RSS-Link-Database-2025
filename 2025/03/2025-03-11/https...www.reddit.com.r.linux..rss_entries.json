Also Command and Conquer Generals. After this It was all Intel/Nvidia up to the GTX 1080. This is when I switched to linux because finally Proton. Quickly did I realize Nvidia GPUs on Linux were a problem. Especially once I wanted an HTPC with Holo ISO. This is when I went to the 5950X and 6900XT. Fantastic experience, has aged like fine wine. Just being part on the Linux community and looking at the Nvidia situation... Worse performance compared to Windows, tons of game specific bugs, Wayland issues, taking months to get driver issues fix, driver updates seem to break as much as they fix. So other than the HDMI 2.1 situation with AMD it has been smooth sailing. HDMI situation is more problems with HDMI Forum and TV makers not putting DisplayPort on TVs so I don&#39;t blame AMD for this at all. New GPUs just came out and I am not ",

How delicate it is for disk error (or other unsuspected events)? - for example, let&#39;s say I have some bad sectors. Today, if it happen, I usually lost a specific file, or a few files.
