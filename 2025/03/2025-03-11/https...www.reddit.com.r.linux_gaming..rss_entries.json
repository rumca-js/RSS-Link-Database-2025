I really liked it so far, but switched back to Winblows 11. Why? At that time, I build a fresh new system (with Corsair ICUE components) and I had a lot of problems, setting up the controls and making the daisy chain working as intented.</p> <p>Well, the root cause was, that the ICUE hubs needed a firmware update (which I wasnt aware of and only found out, while installing the ICUE software from Corsair on Win11). Then I decided to just stick with the debloated Win 11.</p> <p>Now, I am again interested in switching to Linux. Currently, I use the AMD Adrenaline Edition for overclockung/undervolting the GPU and the build in meter for ingame monitoring and it works really well (I have a 7800X3D and a 7900XTX). Additionally, I use ICUE for RGB controls and fan curves. So far, ICUE has not caused a single issue after it was setup properly.</p> <p>Ques",

Now before, I was seeing idle temps around 150 F +/- 10 say, and steam was starting to push it into 220 F area. This fresh install is currently running at 116 F.</p> <p>This machine is not too bad I mean maybe not gamer level whatever, what should I know before I just go and reinstall steam and hit the same brick wall.?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chrisco2323\"> /u/chrisco2323 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j8g5ez/laptop_heating_steam_game_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j8g5ez/laptop_heating_steam_game_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",
