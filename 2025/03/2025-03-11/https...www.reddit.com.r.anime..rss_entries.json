Here\u2019s some examples of what I like:</p> <p>Attack on titan Claymore Akame Ga Kill Demon Slayer Jujutsu Kaisen Berserk Vinland Saga Fairy Gone Full metal Alchemist (and brotherhood)</p> <p>I\u2019ve watched Dragonball, Naruto/shippuden, hunter x hunter, assassin classroom, one piece, and more. They\u2019re good but a little too kiddy for me right now.
