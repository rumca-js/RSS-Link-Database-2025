But in truth, I think many\nmore Apple users will be wowed by a new look than would ever care\nabout Siri. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Sure, the new look introduced with iOS 7 was a massively\ncontroversial one, and many thought that then Apple design chief\nJony Ive should never have been allowed anywhere near the software\nside of the business. But love it or hate it, you certainly\ncouldn\u2019t ignore it.</p>\n\n<p>The same will be true of a new 3D look, which might even include\nsome (much more modern) skeuomorphic elements.

In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be reconfiguring beats\non the tech team to give more of them a wide ambit. Fewer will\nfocus narrowly on individual companies. We are also advertising\nfor a new tech-focused job on Heard in New York.</p>\n\n<p>These changes do mean that some reporters and editors in San\nFrancisco and New York will be leaving us.
