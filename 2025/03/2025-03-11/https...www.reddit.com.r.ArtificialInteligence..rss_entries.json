As human beings we exhibit a high level of intelligence, enough so that we can create Artificial Intelligence. We can do this, without even fully understanding what is going on in our own heads. Current LLM and Deep Learning technology uses novel algorithms to deduce meaning from text and use that to decide what to do next which mimics Human intelligence very well.</p> <p>A lot of people right now seem to believe that it is only a matter of time before AI gets to human level (which I believe in terms of output, it has in many respects), and once it gets to that level it will be able to improve itself bringing Super Intelligence and then the Singularity.</p> <p>My question is this, if human beings are smart enough to ",

This work effectively addresses the challenge of cross-modal retrieval without requiring massive datasets.</p> <p>The key technical contribution is a dynamic weighting mechanism for contrastive learning that gives more importance to harder negative examples during training. Instead of treating all negative pairs equally, LLaVE identifies which mismatched image-text pairs are more similar (and thus harder to distinguish) and places greater emphasis on them.</p> <p>Main technical points: - LLaVE leverages existing multimodal models like LLaVA, adding projection layers to map outputs to a shared embedding space - Their hardness-weighted contrastive learning focuses model attention on the most challenging negative examples - The approach follows a two-stage process: pre-training on CC3",

If we achieve AGI/ASI (I.e the point at which a model surpasses all human intelligence), it seems impossible to monitor it for alignment. By definition, either 1) Even the smartest humans cannot fully comprehend the functioning of the model, or 2) Humans could think they understand the functioning of the model, but cannot actually be sure, because the model is deceiving them because the model is inherently smarter. Once we reach the point of AI acting beyond the point of human comprehension, it seems entirely up to chance whether it does good or bad things for humanity.
