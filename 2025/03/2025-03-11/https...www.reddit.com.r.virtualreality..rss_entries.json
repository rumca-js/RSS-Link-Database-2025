They&#39;re super thin and lightweight, I can see them for sale for Quest 3 PCVR but from pictures they look identical to a regular USB-C cable.

Or is it a scam?</li> <li>What are my options in terms of connecting my Quest 3 to my PC via a cable? I know of Meta Quest Link but I don&#39;t like the software.

I started sending it only to my newsletter subscribers, but then I started to make it more generally available also on my blog.</p> <p>Today I&#39;ve just published the 400TH EPISODE of these roundups!

My first impression in VR was on The Climb, and I almost fell over from the feeling of being on the side of a mountain, it was really an experience I won\u2019t ever forget. I enjoyed the games a bit (actually was #1 in the world on some of the climb runs in the days after the game released) and enjoyed beat saber when it came out. I slowly stopped playing VR due to the lack of games (yes I know a ton were releasing but imo at low quality, and with bad tech), and the comfort of the headsets. From 2022-2024, I pretty much completely stopped playing any VR. </p> <p>About a week ago, I decided to get a Quest 3 for sim racing, as an improvement to my single monitor setup. During the setup process, you are taught how to do two simple things (use your hands as controllers, and enter and exit pass through). For some reason, when I did these, I was absolutely amazed.
