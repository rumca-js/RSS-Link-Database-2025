I thought it might have been an update or a DE or OS or mouse configuration.</p> <p>Then I noticed it. A PDF I had on my desktop had what looked like an internet shortcut icon. I hovered over it. Yep, it&#39;s a PDF. I clicked on it. Zen Browser opened up and displayed the PDF.</p> <h1>OH HAIL NO!</h1> <p>I did <strong>NOT</strong> give Zen permission to be the default PDF viewer. Who do they think they are, Microsoft Edge? What else are they doing behind the scenes that I&#39;m not aware of. That is some shady stuff going on right there. I uninstalled it immediately.</p> <p>Upon reboot my PDF icon went back to normal, and the file association restored. On top of that, the mouse stutter was gone! Better off with out it. Thanks for reading. :)</p> <p>The End",

I use a specific webpage where I log in and out of said page to begin and end my work. When I login a timer(built into the page or at their end in some way) starts tracking my time and when I log out it stops.</p> <p>I have had an issue where I&#39;ve been asked to explain why it&#39;s taken me 30hours to do 24hours of work in a week - I was baffled, I use my own timing software which showed approx 24hours - so I am doing it right, at my end.</p> <p>I did some digging using their data and supposedly I had not logged out when I had. I blamed their timing systems etc. but obviously it&#39;s now my word against theirs.</p> <p>I was using chrome and did some digging and I couldn&#39;t find any trace of my log outs in browser history - even though I know I did log out. I checked my timing software, I know exactly when I logged out but every so often there is no trace of me ",
