I\u2019ve recently built a niche business directory that covers the entire United States and has over 13,000 businesses in it.</p> <p>I offer a number of different ways for users to search for the best businesses in this niche near them, including a \u201cstate grid.\u201d</p> <p>This is basically 50 buttons with state names and images of each state on them.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to replace this with an actual interactive map of the US if possible. Whether it\u2019s a realistic representation, or the states are just simple circles, equally sized and approximately located, I don\u2019t mind.</p> <p>I\u2019d just like to be able to create some sort of hover animation and allow each state to be identified by name and act as a button.</p> <p>I\u2019m hoping something like this has already been created and is open source for me to use. I know WordPress has plugins like this but I\u2019ve built my site myself with Next.js and TailwindCSS.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",
