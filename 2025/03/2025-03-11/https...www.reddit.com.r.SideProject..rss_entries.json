Building apps, talking to clients, figuring out pricing, managing expectations\u2014it\u2019s not as simple as just \u201cwriting code.\u201d</p> <p>When I first started freelancing, I thought it would be all about building apps. Turns out, it\u2019s way more than that. You have to sell your skill, explain technical stuff to non-technical people, price your work without undercutting yourself, and somehow stay motivated when there are no clients for days.</p> <p>The hardest part? Getting that first client. I still remember the feeling of waiting for someone to say \u201cYes, let\u2019s do it\u201d. And when it finally happened, it felt unreal. Like, \u201cDamn, someone actually trusts me to build their product.\u201d</p> <p>But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned: people don\u2019t hire you just because you can code.

All our projects were customised and when there was an opportunity for royalties, one of the biggest issues we had was that we were not the manufacturers. In the end, we ended up as truly glorified middlepeople.</p> <p>we&#39;ve been trying to solve this problem for ourselves for a while and came across some platforms that we wanted to work with. But they didn&#39;t want us. So we&#39;re striking out on our own. </p> <p>We\u2019re launching loop, a B2B platform where designers can upload their files and let clients order directly from manufacturers\u2014while ensuring they get paid continuously for every order placed. Our tagline? &quot;Design once, earn forever.&quot;</p> <p>I will share the link in the comments for anyone interested in signing up for our launch. </p> <p>This is a &quot;test-the-market&quot; phase for us, so please send your feedbacks!",
