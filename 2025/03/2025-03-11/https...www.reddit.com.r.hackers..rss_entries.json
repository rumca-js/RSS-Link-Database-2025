I never get into these kind of scams but a mutual friend with full confidence said it\u2019s not a scam and go ahead I am 100 sure. Turns out even he was a dumbass that I knew before and now that I have reported in cybercrime department they are not even taking actions my complaint is there from more than a month they are asking me to come there and give a statement but I don\u2019t think even that would help police have this habit of victim blaming and the worst thing is that the scammer didn\u2019t even block me and saying with full confidence do whatever you can complaint to any police or so. The thing is that it\u2019s a kind of scam where people don\u2019t like to disclose something like that. So, I guess no one is ever reported him.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
