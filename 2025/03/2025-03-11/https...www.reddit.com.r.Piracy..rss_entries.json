What would it take to broadcast *(like the good ole days of pirate radio) a JellyFin library? *(Other than Port Forwarding like a Netflix server)...</p> <p>************************************</p> <p>The Background Story</p> <p>************************************</p> <p>So just a few weeks ago i had to help a family member add Bluetooth to their car *(a mercedes with --those-- kinda irreplaceable radios). Quick and dirty method was adding a bluetooth with FM modulator in the **middle-ish** FM frequency lock (99.9FM; not the usual 88.0 and 108.0). REASON? Because as i took the car down to the city.. the number of times either 88.0 or 108.0 was hijacked was.. ALOT. :) I mean it was kinda technically funny hearing each other&#39;s FM modulators fighting each other at the traffic lights.</p> <p>So anyways; this brought me down a small rabbit hole of pirate radios. </p> <p>I mean; for music.. its easy.. load",
