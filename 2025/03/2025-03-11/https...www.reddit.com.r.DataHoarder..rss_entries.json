The source for <code>badblocks</code> makes an effort to bypass the Linux disk cache but modern hard drives have a cache on the controller board. The typical options for a modern hard drive would result in the program writing 512kB, reading the freshly written data, moving to the next 512kB of the disk, and repeat until reaching the end of the drive. So, what will a modern hard drive do when it is told to write 512kB and immediately read that same 512kB when it has an on-board cache (256MB) of over 500 times that size? Wouldn\u2019t it just read the data from the cache instead of the physical disk? Why has no one in all of the discussions of <code>badblocks</code> seemed to have noticed the read/write cycle involves far less data than can be stored in the disk\u2019s on-board cache? Does",

It was forgotten in an old laptop bag, without any protection, but in the dark. It stores around 300mb of jpeg pictures, and after reviewing them, it seems that data was not corrupt, at least there is nothing visually wrong. The disc surface is moderately scratched. The model printed on the disc is : &quot;Philips CD-R80 / 52X / 700mb&quot;. I have no idea what tech this is, I know next to nothing about cd burning, I have burnt a grand total of about 3 discs in my whole life, and apparently lost 2 of them.</p> <p>That&#39;s it, just a datapoint that some of you may find interesting.
