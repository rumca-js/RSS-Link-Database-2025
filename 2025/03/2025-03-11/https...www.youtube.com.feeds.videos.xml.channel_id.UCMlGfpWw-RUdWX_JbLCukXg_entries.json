By chaining the computations, these abstractions allow you to manipulate the underlying values using less boilerplate code. In addition, we have a range library for processing collections of elements in a similar manner.\nThese topics have been quite popular in the C++ community for the last five years or so. However, many of them are focused on theoretical parts, have only small non-related examples, or even use other programming languages to illustrate the ideas.\nThis talk is prepared based on more than one year of using functional programming approaches for developing one of the commercial internal libraries our team is working on. I\u2019m going to share this experience with the audience. We\u2019ll talk about API design in general, spitting bet",
