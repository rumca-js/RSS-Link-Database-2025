Its free and has no plans or pricing, if I got enough interest in community I can consider pricing then. </p> <p>Now I need just early users and feedbacks. It is still under development but the mainframe is becoming visible, so I think that I can take some reviews.<br/> You can write in here or email me at [<a href=\"mailto:feedback@lufeed.com\">feedback@lufeed.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:feedback@lufeed.com\">feedback@lufeed.com</a>)</p> <p>My Website is <a href=\"https://lufeed.com\">https://lufeed.com</a>.

However, I have noticed that these RSS feeds usually have a delay of 1\u20133 minutes, which is significant for algorithmic trading. Looking into it, I believe this happens because they are caching the content before updating the feed. I found someone facing a similar issue, and they mentioned finding a solution but they were unwilling to share it(smh).</p> <p>Anyway, my guess is that they are scraping the website. However, I am curious if you know of any other fast ways to get the information? My only problem with web scraping is that you never know when the website is going to change; this is especially a problem when I need to scrape multiple websites daily.</p> <p>As an example, here is the PR Newswire RSS feed: <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/rss/news-releases-list.rss\">https://www.prnewswire.com/rss/news-rele",
