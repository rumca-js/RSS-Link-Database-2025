Of course, the technology presented was too futuristic but that&#39;s beside the point. I&#39;m referring to the insane plot choices that had me cackling throughout the playtime. This wasn&#39;t even close to my first time seeing Face/Off but below are some of the things that made me realize how dumb (still a fun watch) this movie really is. </p> <p>1.) Although they make it clear that it&#39;s not only Archer&#39;s face they will be changing during his secret procedure, I don&#39;t think they emphasized that every single aspect of his outward appearance would be changed. You see him get his scar removed (back to this later) but Troy was sleeping with Archer&#39;s wife while wearing his face. That would imply that they either have the exact same sexual anatomy, his wife is completely clueless, or they surgically made Archer&#39;s body identical to Troy&#39;s. </p> <p>2.) Thr",
