The photo, dated November 19, 2024, was discovered in the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth database. These rare upward-shooting discharges occur when storm cloud charge layers invert, propelling energy skyward. The image, shared by Spaceweather.com, highlights the striking blue light and faint red tendrils, characteristic of these high-altitude electrical events. Scientists believe thousands of such jets occur annually, though few are ever documented.",
