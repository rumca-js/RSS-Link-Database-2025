        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nA report from Windows Central details Microsoft's next-gen Xbox plans, and they include not only a new console, but two handhelds, one of which is due later this year. Microsoft has yet to comment on the report, but some of the details do line up with what Xbox's Phil Spencer said at IGN Live last year, that the company won't have its own handheld ready for at least a couple of years. In other news, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann spoke with filmmaker Alex Garland about the upcoming sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, and how religion plays a big role in the game's story. And finally, images and video from a new Battlefield playtest have leaked onto reddit, and EA doesn't seem to mind?",
