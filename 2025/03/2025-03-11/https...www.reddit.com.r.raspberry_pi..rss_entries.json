A little background about myself, I have experience in coding and in logical control systems but have very little experience with Pi.</p> <p>Here is the problem I am trying to solve for a charity organization I volunteer with: They have a 120VAC pump that fires on a timer 4 times a day. This pump releases fly spray to the horse stalls. There are two industrial fans (120VAC all on separate circuits). These fans stay on during the summer to help cool the horses. However, if the fans are on, they blow the fly spray away from the stalls and it basically goes to waste. I need a way to remove power to the fans while the pump is running. We could try to sync a timer to the pump, but as power fails frequently there, it is likely they would fall out of sync rather quickly. We could piggyback the signal from the timer to the pump into Pi, though at the time of writi",
