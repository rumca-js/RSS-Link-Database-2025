        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am currently working on a project with django rest api and react js. I am confused in selecting a proper authentication method. It&#39;s a small internal web based app that would only be used within the company and targeting less than 60 users. Should I go for jwt based authentication or try to implement session based authentication. Even though I have experience in the backend Development, I am used to code in jwt based authentication since we had a react native based app. Does jwt have any security issues? If session authentication is better how can I make it work with react js. I remember trying this few years back and cookies were not working when on different domains. I am planning to dockerize entire thing. Will the session work properly then?</p> <p>Nb: I have been working on spring boot project for few years. My first few years was with django. Returning to django now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
