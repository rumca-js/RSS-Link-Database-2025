No big war, no big conspiracies, hell, maybe even no Sith, but maybe just a solitary Jedi working outside of the order or within it, dealing with moral quandaries as they travel. Set it in the old Republic, High Republic, or somewhere in between, a time when the Jedi could still act like the warrior monks they were initially conceived as, not some crazy action hero.</p> <p>The Witcher&#39;s approach to how a character like Geralt fits into a world really got me thinking about how the Jedi we&#39;re kind of mean",
