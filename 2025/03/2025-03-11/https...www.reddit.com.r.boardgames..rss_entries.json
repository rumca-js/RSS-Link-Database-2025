Fairly new to actual historical wargames (I&#39;ve played Andean Abyss a little). So EU has come to my attention, and I&#39;ve done a little research on it. It certainly looks beautiful. It&#39;s definitely very big. But is it worth it? </p> <p>What I mean by that is... it is expensive, it is an enormous table hog, it requires a table of several players who will not only spend a lot of time reading the rules ahead of time, it looks like it might require 2 full days or 4 or 5 nights. It&#39;s a big ask on all fronts... so I guess I am hoping to find out.. what makes it good, what makes it better than other wargames? how does it compare to something like TI4? </p> <p>Is it fun? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PedantJuice\"> /u/PedantJuice </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j90kxp/europa_universalis_is",

Hadn&#39;t played with him before, but had heard he was stocked with a ton of cool limited edition kickstarter-driven games. One of which, was Guardians of Atlantis II.</p> <p>I LOVED IT! What an awesome concept, and the production value was insane! As soon as I got home, I started doing some googling, and I&#39;ve been disappointed to learned the game isn&#39;t sold in retail.</p> <p>I looked around for news about any upcoming re-releases via kickstarter, but haven&#39;t found anything. That said, Chuck claims he&#39;d heard rumors they were planning another one soon. Can anyone confirm that? Is it official? What is the best way for me to get a copy of this game if not via retail or kickstarter?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jrb9249\"> /u/jrb9249 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.r",

The game also came with 2 dice- one with dots of color, and one with black outlines of shapes. One side of the board was a traditional &quot;roll the dice and move&quot; game where you have to start at your house and go through town to get to school at the top of the board. On the way, you pass things like a pet store or vet office, a flower shop, grocery store, etc. I remember it being very brightly color",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I want to be able to just relax and play board games or tabletop games with people but I&#39;m not good enough and end up annoying everyone by making careless mistakes or taking to long to learn. In some situations, people have even yelled at me. I&#39;ve tried watching the instruction videos but it doesn&#39;t help. My brain doesn&#39;t do well with logical processing. Sometimes my husband will flat out just tell me what to do when I&#39;m taking too long or about to make a mistake, but instead of feeling grateful I just feel more upset, like a child who can&#39;t do anything on her own (I&#39;m 40). Has anyone else had this issue? Should I just tell my husband to keep going alone to game nights at this point?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayjack14\"> /u/throwawayjack14 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j8ez8j/i_want_to_be_able_to_play_board_games/\">",
