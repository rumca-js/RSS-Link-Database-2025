I love space opera as far as I understand it. I love space empires and fleets fighting each other, and Imperial agents carrying out missions to further their faction&#39;s goals. Heck, I even loved &quot;The Struggle for Empire: A Story of the Year 2236&quot; by Robert William Cole, a rare early space opera book that has all the makings of the genre but none of the refinement over the decades.</p> <p>The reason I say that Ensign Flandry is *almost* what I was looking for is a couple of reasons. The biggest one is that the &#39;60s obsession with spies being manwhores is unappealing to me. I&#39;m not prude or anything, but come on, these guys act like sexual conquests are glorious victories to be had whenever the opportunity arises. It&#39;s",

I wasn\u2019t a bookworm or anything, but enjoyed reading 1984, TKAM and F451 in high school. I\u2019ve read some history and now getting through book one of LOTR.</p> <p>My dear mother (she\u2019s turning 60) isn\u2019t an avid reader either. But, I feel like if she has the right material, she\u2019d really appreciate it. She\u2019s a SAHM, loves to cook and is a hard worker in general. She is quite culturally sound, used to paint art and might appreciate some (later) classic literature or themes. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d like fiction/fantasy, but maybe something that would relate to her on some personal level. We\u2019re Middle Eastern, so she does like watching Lebanese soap operas.</p> <p>I was considering Anne of Green Gables? It seems like a peaceful book, growing up on a farm and all. I\u2019ve never read it. Any suggestions would go a long way and be great. I can answer some questions to help narrow down! Thank you!</p",

I have unconventional tastes and need some book recommendations.</p> <p>I\u2019m hetero, but my taste in men isn\u2019t very mainstream. I really, really love pudgy characters with sensitive personalities and stories that focus on chemistry vs sex appeal (no judgement if that\u2019s your thing!). I\u2019m looking for stories about a Neville Longbottom or a Samwise Gamgee. Chemistry like Morticia and Gomez, where they deeply adore each and embrace their unique qualities\u2014 or like Pride and Prejudice where Mr. Darcy makes positive changes his own sake without the guaranteed that Elizabeth will want him. They become a good match through self-reflection and time. </p> <p>I don\u2019t like stories where everyone is hott, young, flirtatious, and witty. I need something more substantial and grounded with complex emotions, stakes, and baggage. It doesn\u2019t need to specifically be a romance book as long as the element\u2019s",

They get married because of how much they love each other OR the mmf and fmc had to enter into an marriage of convenience to fool some people/ get what they want but around their friends/families, they act like strangers.</p> <p>Also, if there are scenes like the mmc gets jealous because someone&#39;s flirting with his wife or feels neglected because his wife isn&#39;t giving him much attention, it&#39;d be great.</p> <p>Please no jerk MMCs and pregnancy tropes.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lokiswife07\"> /u/lokiswife07 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j8qrzj/looking_for_books_with_secret_marriage_trope/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

I have finished The Time Travelers Wife which is now my new favorite as I branch into new genres of books. Could anyone recommend a good book based on this? Not necessarily time traveling, but a bittersweet, emotionally gripping, and a wonderful love story. My first cry during reading came from this book, and I\u2019d love to experience that again (due to the strength of the story :,) ) thank you very much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/taytayhatton\"> /u/taytayhatton </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j8kpwt/suggestions_based_on_a_recent_read/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j8kpwt/suggestions_based_on_a_recent_read/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve been looking for quite a while now, but I\u2019m on the hunt for black male representation in fiction novels like the title says. I\u2019ve read several fantasy novels, the few there is, that feature a black male lead/co-lead. I want to find more of these, but not just limited to fantasy. Urban fiction, literary fiction, the whole nine. They do exist, but the vast majority seem to be dealing with oppression and black trauma. I just want novels where a character is \u201ccoincidentally\u201d black, and not narratively so.

I also really loved Killing Commendatore by Murakami which is kinda in this vein.

I find this stuff super interesting and would like to read more about it. I know this is a pretty vague description, but I&#39;m particularly interested in stuff like prehistorical wildlife, evolution, exploration, and early human history/development.</p> <p>From the little research I&#39;ve done, 1491 by Charles Mann seems to be a good one.
