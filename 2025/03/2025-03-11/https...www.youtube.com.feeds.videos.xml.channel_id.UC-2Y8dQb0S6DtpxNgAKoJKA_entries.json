We accompany her in this dive to her mind and travel through her memories, traumas and mistakes, narrated by her own voice. The hand-drawn 2d art, the meticulous sound design and the traditional animation method we use bring her to life on this journey of self-forgiveness.\n\n#ps5 #ps5games #ps4 #ps4games",
