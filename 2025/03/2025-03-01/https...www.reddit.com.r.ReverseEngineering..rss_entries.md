<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m trying to understand and list the Pok√©mon Pocket API in order to create a reroll bot. I&#39;ve already tried intercepting requests using burp, mitm and wireshark. But I have the impression that certain requests bypass the proxies and that I do not see them, in fact when I open a booster for example, no request is displayed even though the game should normally communicate with the server at this important moment. I would like to know how to intercept all possible requests or if other people have already done this. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Layen-"> /u/Layen- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://modsfire.com/hT31J7hCO6NyVwm">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1j0wzed/reverse_engineering_pockemon_pocket/">[comments]</a></span>
