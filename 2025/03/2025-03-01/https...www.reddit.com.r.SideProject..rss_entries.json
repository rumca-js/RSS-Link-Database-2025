It is a global average of the 6 largest pollutants of our atmosphere over time. I know it may not seem very impressive, but it took me a while due to the fragmented nature of the data I used. It took a while to get it all together and I believe that there is no other site that shows all 6 in a simple way like this. If I could get some feedback that would be great.

I got a lot of feedback to create an Android or web version. I\u2019m not familiar with Android and so decided to write a quick Chrome extension instead.</p> <p>It\u2019s free and doesn\u2019t collect any data, just press the button and it will open a random website in a new tab. It is drawn from a curated database with about 1300 sites and I add more every day. All safe for most workplaces, albeit some are very strange \ud83d\ude00. </p> <p>Hope you like it. Would love feedback.</p> <p><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webwanderlust-randomiser/gbgpgcphclnhlmppnngjhjdeohhighio\">https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webwanderlust-randomiser/gbgpgcphclnhlmppnngjhjdeohhighio</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Confident_Draft9882\"> /u/Confident_Draft9882 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/S",
