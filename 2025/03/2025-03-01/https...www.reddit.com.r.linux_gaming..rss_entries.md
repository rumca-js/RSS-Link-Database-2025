<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I am getting familiar with Linux, and I chose KDE, because I know Valve uses it for the Steam Deck. Long story short, I don&#39;t really like it that much, and I&#39;m considering trying another DE. Will my gaming performance be worse and will I have bad input lag with for example GNOME or Cinnamon? I tend to use x11 instead of wayland because I have a laptop that has hybrid graphics and it is a better experince on x11.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Szhadji"> /u/Szhadji </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j1b6qs/is_kde_a_must_for_gaming_on_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j1b6qs/is_kde_a_must_for_gaming_on_linux/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A little background: I&#39;ve been into using tmux+nvim in the console for my programming needs lately and WSL doesn&#39;t scratch that itch entirely so I&#39;m looking for a distro to switch to that can also handle my occasional gaming needs. I tried Pop_OS! before and some more distros back when I believe the community was transitioning to Wayland and/or the new KDE version, so all the toolings worked really badly with my laptop, the fan control was completely bonkers and that was important to me because I like my budget craptop to run as cool as possible and don&#39;t mind the noise.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure how much things have changed since then, but I really do want to go back to Linux. I do plan to customize the UX/UI heavily in the future with different WMs and all that, but in the beginning I just want a distro that:</p> <ol> <li>Works well with this budget craptop (MSI Katana GF6611UC) out of the box, with every parts functional.</li> <li>Si

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this is really weird because I would have thought this was a network issue but apparently its not. It&#39;s OS related.</p> <p>I upgraded to ubuntu 24.04 recently and have been having some performance issues with games on steam. Some games will freeze on close and need to be stopped from the steam launcher. That&#39;s not much of an issue, it&#39;s obviously not great practice but its *fine*. But then there&#39;s some network connectivity issues I&#39;ve been chasing down. I play Helldivers 2 and No Man&#39;s Sky and can pull them up and play no issues until I try to play with others. I can&#39;t see other people or connect to other user&#39;s games at all. </p> <p>Originally I thought this was something like a Pi-Hole issue or OPNSense issue because I could turn on my VPN and play with others no problem. But then I tried using Windows and was able to connect almost instantly to other players.<br/> I have ufw disabled on my system. Probably not sm

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is SteamOs meant to be something similar to Bazzite, where there is a full desktop and OS behind it, optimized to run Steam, or is it an image that boots directly into, and only contains relevant packages for Steam (no desktop needed behind Steam)?</p> <p>Seems like it would be an amazing way to make a dedicated steam machine, like a console device, or even a VM that booted directly into steam and didn&#39;t have the overhead of a full OS behind it. But apparently the steam deck and legion both have desktops running behind steam.</p> <p>So maybe I&#39;m missing something, but it would be really neat to run a VM or device that was skimmed down only to run Steam directly. I know the overhead of running a desktop is not huge, but idk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tangerine_Monk"> /u/Tangerine_Monk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j0u6d9/i_guess_i_dont_unde

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey All! </p> <p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen this error popping up about the Denuvo DRM causing issues with people on Linux. Common troubleshooting there and on the Steam Deck is to force a different version of Proton until you find one that works. </p> <p>The issue and current thought going around is that each new version of Proton you try is counted as a new computer, and after troubleshooting on Linux you might end up in a position where you can no longer troubleshoot your issue because you&#39;ve exceeded the number of PC&#39;s your allowed to use within a certain time period. </p> <p>I&#39;m currently experiencing the same error, but with a behavioral exception to the issue presented above.
