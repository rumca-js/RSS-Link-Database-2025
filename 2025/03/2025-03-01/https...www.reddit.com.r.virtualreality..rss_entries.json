I&#39;m a Pimax/Index owner and self-proclaimed VR power user, so I know just how horrible 3dof smartphone VR &quot;headsets&quot; are. However, I&#39;m also a DJ, and I want to make a helmet/costume to wear when doing sets, using FPV cameras and a lensed display. I found a setup that lets you use a smartphone VR setup with a pair of FPV cameras to do real-time stereoscopic passthrough, and I plan to build the helmet around it if I can&#39;t find a better alternative that lets me remote-mount the cameras.</p> <p>The one problem I&#39;m concerned about is how far the uber-cheap smartphone VR &quot;headsets&quot; stick out from the face! I want to have the helmet be a reasonable size, meaning I need a very thin setup. Does anyone know of such a thin smartphone setup (or really, any stereoscopic FPV device)? Hopefully under $50 if such a thing exists, but with some saving I could go higher if absolutely necessary.</p> <p>(No, it&#39;s not goi",
