<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basically, I&#39;ve been enjoying myself playing various Sonic game mods, particularly enjoying all the stuff available for SA1 on Steam that polishes it up. However, every single time I try and play the Mushroom Hill Zone neo mod, I can never access it. Like I&#39;ve been saying, I&#39;ve been playing SA1 on steam and have been using the SAModManager to load and play the various mods.</p> <p>Does anyone possibly know what the problem here is and how to fix it? Thanks in advance and here&#39;s a link to the stage mod in question.</p> <p><a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/149553">https://gamebanana.com/mods/149553</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Choco-man555"> /u/Choco-man555 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1j14o8u/how_to_play_mushroom_hill_zone_neo_on_sa1dx_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1j14o8u/how
