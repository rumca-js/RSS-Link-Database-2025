Taara&#39;s general manager, Mahesh Krishnaswamy, has introduced the Taara chip, a silicon photonic chip that uses light to transmit high-speed data through the air. The Taara chip is abut the size of a fingernail, far smaller than the technology the Alphabet division has been using. Taara Lightbridge, which is what its first-generation technology is called, is the size of a traffic light and uses a system of mirrors and sensors to physically steer light to where it needs to go. The new chip uses software instead.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Taara is a project under X, Alphabet&#39;s moonshot factory. The high speed wireless optical link technology underpinning the project was originally developed for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/",
