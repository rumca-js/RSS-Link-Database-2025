<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am working professional, I wanted to simulate DDOS on my clients public assets. We have a partner who does it for us. He does L4 and L7 attacks both using linode cloud, he creates botnes and also he said he use MHDDOS tools. But when I am trying to install MHDDOS it is showing me tons of errors, not getting installed, not showing anything appart from error. I am curious to know how he is doing DDOS with those botnets and that tool. Does anyone know how I can perfrom the way he is performing or anything blog link, tutorials or guide. I am unable to find anything that I can use.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Striking-Ad-414"> /u/Striking-Ad-414 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1j0xn15/thinking_about_ddos_simulation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1j0xn15/thinking_about_ddos_simulation/">[comments]</a></span>
