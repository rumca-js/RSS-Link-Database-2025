<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know that many of us are not our own bosses, and we work for others. I am not a software developer, but I recently had an idea to create and sell one, as a kind of subscription service. It is something complex, so some anecdotes or similar experiences would be helpful :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Serenade0Fconscience"> /u/Serenade0Fconscience </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1j0phv4/have_you_ever_sold_software/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1j0phv4/have_you_ever_sold_software/">[comments]</a></span>
