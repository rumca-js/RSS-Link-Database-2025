Most of us are no heroes, most of us are a bit broken, trying our best to be good, but often not making it. We make mistakes, we break down, and still life requires us to march on. We feel the pain of letting a dog go to sleep, of losing family members and friends. Our love stories are not perfect, our best so often fall short. Yet still we march on, we hope, we dream, we live.</p> <p>Hobb is telling it as it is: honest, painful and with only the barest glimmer of hope. We cry with Fitz, because we&#39;ve been him. Our hearts break anew in echo with older scars. And mirrored in Fitz&#39;s fate we see ourselves hoping to arrive at and ending to ",
