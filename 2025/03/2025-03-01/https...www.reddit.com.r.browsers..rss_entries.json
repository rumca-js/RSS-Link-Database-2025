However, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Firefox as I\u2019ve experienced a few bugs while using it and Arc dying, I\u2019ve been thinking about building a chromium based browser similar to zen with the same level of customization or more. After browsing repos to fork I came across MinBrowser. They\u2019ve done their whole UI using JavaScript which means most people will be able to change and customize it to their liking. However, they do not support any chrome extensions but as a community project I think we can get there. </p> <p>Vision: A browser where you can easily add or install components to your UI. This can be done using a component based framework (SolidJS, React, Preact) and tailwind css for styling. </p> <p>With this tech stack I believe it\u2019ll be extremely easy to change and add whatever you like, let me know your thoughts down below!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte",
