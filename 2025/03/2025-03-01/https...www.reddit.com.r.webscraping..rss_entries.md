<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys! Im currently scraping amazon for 10k+ products a day without getting blocked. Iâ€™m using user agents and just read out the fronted. </p> <p>Iâ€™m fairly new to this so I wonder why so many people use proxies and even pay for it when it is very possible to scrape many websites without them? Are they used for websites with harder anti bot measures? Am I going to jail for scraping this way, lol? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/schnold"> /u/schnold </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1j1a447/why_do_proxies_even_exist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1j1a447/why_do_proxies_even_exist/">[comments]</a></span>

I tried everything which I was able to understand but I am not able to implement in my python project. Please can someone give me some guide or steps?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/V_I_K_I_N_G_B_A_T"> /u/V_I_K_I_N_G_B_A_T </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1j19lf7/how_to_use_curl_impersonate_and_curl_cffi_please/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1j19lf7/how_to_use_curl_impersonate_and_curl_cffi_please/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m having trouble running multiple Selenium instances on my server. I keep getting this error:</p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>I have a server with 7 CPU threads and 8GB RAM. Even when I limit Selenium to 5 instances, I still get this error about 50% of the time. For example, if I send 10 requests, about 5 of them fail with this exception.</p> <p>My server doesn&#39;t seem overloaded, but I&#39;m not sure anymore. I&#39;ve tried different things like immediate retries and restarting Selenium, but it doesn&#39;t help. If a Selenium instance fails to start, it always throws this error.</p> <p>This error usually happens at the beginning, when the browser tries to open the page for scraping. Sometimes, but rarely, it happens in the middle of a session. Nothing is killing the processes in the background as far as I know.</p> <p>Does anyone else run multiple Selenium instances on one machine? Have you had similar issues? How do y
