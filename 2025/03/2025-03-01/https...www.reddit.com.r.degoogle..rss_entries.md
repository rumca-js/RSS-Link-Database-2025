<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is actually my second post, my last post has been sitting out for weeks and not a lot of comments have came through, I’m also going to be wording this post a little better in order to narrow down precisely what I’m looking for. Anyways, let’s get down to business. I’m looking for a search engine that actually looks deep into the web. Not like google which searches a tiny bit of the web and then starts to aggressively deteriorate its results. Search engines also suck at keeping up with good results and they start to suck when you scroll. I once saw a SearXNG instance (forgot the URL) that actually attempted to search all sources unlike google. It popped up unique results that differed from others and started to actually try and search sites like twitter and other stuff to find exactly what I was looking for. Anyways, thanks for reading this post! (It’s like 12:21 PM lol.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.redd
