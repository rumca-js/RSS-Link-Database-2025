<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel this is a stupid thing to post here about, but i‚Äôm more just trying to get into an old account for nostalgic purposes. </p> <p>I used to play a game called Animal Jam back in 2014-2015. I found out the game is still up and running and just wanted to log into the old account for fun, but I was a kid at the time and it‚Äôs been some years so obviously i forgot the password and email linked to it. </p> <p>Animal Jam has been breached and hacked multiple times because they‚Äôve been known to have terrible security so I was wondering if it would be hard to get information such as my password back. </p> <p>Only information i have right now is the username and IP address. I already tried LeakCheck but no password was found from the breach.</p> <p>Im aware this is a bit silly of me to post but i am just curious if it‚Äôs possible for me to get it back. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mankeyball"> /u/ma

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So yeah, I got hacked and I can&#39;t get to @TeamYouTube, I found that if you have a channel url made on your email there is a chance they can help you get it back, since YouTube is only place where human can help you everything else can only be done by you. I hope that you can help me to get to them, my main gmail for compromised, many of things I got changed but also many of them got left out. So if you have or know someone who has big following on Twitter please help me. There are thousands of people that are Tweeting at them everyday and so it is really hard to get to them. They have such bad self help that you can&#39;t do anything by yourself, you need someone and that someone is available on Twitter, so please if anyone can help me, I would really greatly appreciate it and if not, thank you for reading and have good rest of the day.</p> <p>My @J_0_S_7 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/J_O_

## How to create flask server and "dummy" files that send request to it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I saw this video <a href="https://youtu.be/CV8rr7hED2Q?si=iiD3TWiCwaF5Bzcf">https://youtu.be/CV8rr7hED2Q?si=iiD3TWiCwaF5Bzcf</a> and from 6:45 you can see that he created a simple Flask server which receives requests from another script (test.py). So far, so good. The problem is that, moving forward in the video, he explains that he put some &quot;dummy&quot; files (PDF, batch, EXE, etc.) that, when opened, send a request to the Flask server. Furthermore, it created a warning screen that says this is a social experiment. So my two questions are:</p> <p>1) How did he create PDF files, batch files, and EXE files capable of sending requests to the Flask server? I don&#39;t think he used Python because not everyone has Python on their computer. 2) How did he show the warning screen every time the user opened one of those files?</p> <p>I hope you can help, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com
