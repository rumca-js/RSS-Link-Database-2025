        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi. I am a writer working with an SEO expert to run a blog. He gives me keywords that apparently has a lot of search volume but when I research about them, they&#39;re not related to any authentic platform, site, etc. All I find are AI-generated blog posts that do not even explain the keyword properly. My question is, if these keywords aren&#39;t related to any authentic thing, why thousands of people are searching for them (looking at their search volume)? We try to use keywords that have, of course, high volume to get traffic. But as a writer, i find it hard to write quality content on something that doesn&#39;t even exist. Can any of you guys clear up my confusion?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Strong_Tax1466\"> /u/Strong_Tax1466 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1j0sdte/keywords_that_have_a_huge_volume_but_they_arent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"http",
