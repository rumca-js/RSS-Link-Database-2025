<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for a new provider and I was wondering what folks think of NewsDemon .. I can get an unlimited plan for 60 a year which seems really fair but I think I tried them years ago...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m finding I have a bunch of files that are unable to complete and it seems to be getting worse. My main account is ninja, and I have <a href="http://bulknews.eu">bulknews.eu</a> and <a href="http://usenet.farm">usenet.farm</a> block accounts. Every couple of years I try and do some digging to figure out which block accounts exist in a different network from my main, but I&#39;m hoping someone here might be able to point out some that work for them with ninja. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jarshwah"> /u/jarshwah </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j0v5qm/recommendations_for_block_accounts_outside_ninja/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j0v5qm/recommendations_for_block_accounts_outside_ninja/">[comments]</a></span>
