Is it actually necessary to have that many backups?</p> <p>Let&#39;s say I have photos and files on my phone and laptop that automatically sync with my NAS, and I also have RAID set up as protection.

I also looked at some non-name brand 4 bay enclosures and stuff like QNAP, and the general consensus of what I read it&#39;s it requires more technical knowledge and maintenance. I am okay technically but since this is my first unit I&#39;d like it to be somewhat streamlined so I can fully experience what it can do and get a feel for what I might want in the future without having to worry about maintenence type issues.

The drives are hooked up to an LSI 9300-16i, which I slapped a fan onto so it doesn&#39;t overheat.

Also, I have pretty good PC so it plays no role here. 13700K, 4070, all the works.</p> <ol> <li>Would upgrading to faster SSD like Samsung 990 Pro with 7000mbs speed helps speed up when loading the files in explorer?</li> <li>Is there an alternative for windows explorer for media viewing that&#39;s alot faster, what is it called?</li> <li>Does Windows explorer really have speed limit that doesn&#39;t take advantage of even faster SSD speeds like the PCIE 5?</li> <li>Is there way to speed up viewing higher quality images that&#39;s like over 10MB of size?</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElonTastical"> /u/ElonTastical </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
