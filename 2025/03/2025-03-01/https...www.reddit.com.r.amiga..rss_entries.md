<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Could someone please dumb this down for me? So, a Amiga 500 OCS has a trapdoor expansion and a side/CPU expansion:</p> <p>You can upgrade Chip RAM to 1MB via motherboard chip replacements or via the trapdoor expansion and jumpers??</p> <p>How do I upgrade fast RAM? Is that only via the side/CPU (Zorro?) expansion, or <em>can it also be done via the trapdoor (</em><strong><em>if you don&#39;t cofigure it as chip RAM</em></strong><em>)</em>?</p> <p>Where on earth does &quot;slow&quot; RAM sit in all the above? Is this only via the trapdoor IF you don&#39;t configure it for chip RAM, or is it the remaining RAM on the expansion above the 512Kb chip RAM updgrade?</p> <p>I&#39;m so confused :( </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/spacemidget75"> /u/spacemidget75 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j10859/im_still_struggling_understanding_ram/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a memory of the game Midnight Resistance, if you unplugged the joystick, wet your finger and rubbed it on the port pins, you&#39;d get infinite lives or invincibility or some other advantage?</p> <p>Can anyone shed any light on this?

A quick Google doesn&#39;t throw anything up. </p> <p>I&#39;ll sure I have memories of doing this with a mate and giggling in amazement when it worked.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/X3TIT"> /u/X3TIT </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j0vqsc/midnight_resistance_cheat/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j0vqsc/midnight_resistance_cheat/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, ive been searching for a game for years, it had if i remember correctly differently colored spaceships you could choose and was thrust based with shooting.</p> <p>You had to land in between to not run out of fuel, and there were also colored keys you had to collect in levels to open gates.</p> <p>I clearly remember the thrust sounding like a low res burping sound haha.</p> <p>I tried looking through lists of games but i cant find it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TiduzNL"> /u/TiduzNL </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j0su63/finding_a_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1j0su63/finding_a_game/">[comments]</a></span>
