Games Workshop sent us early access to the new box set and Michael was very keen to try out Slaneesh's Chosen. Tycho painted up this army in a week so we could have it ready for your viewing pleasure. To challenge the Emperor's Children we have the Ultramarines who bear a grudge against their heretic brothers. \n\nThank you to Games Workshop for providing us early access to the Codex and new box! #AdWIP #EmperorsChildren #WarhammerCommunity \n\nThis game brought to you by Frontline Gaming.
