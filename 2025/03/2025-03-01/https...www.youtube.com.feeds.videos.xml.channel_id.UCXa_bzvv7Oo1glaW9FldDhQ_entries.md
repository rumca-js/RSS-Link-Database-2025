Golf is simultaneously a game of calm concentration and stressful anticipation. Capturing that feeling - along with the physics, responsiveness, and fierce competition - that make up the sport is no easy task. Even HB Studios seemed to falter in this endeavor with PGA Tour 2K23.

Two years later, it's back with a much more refined and polished product, even if MyCareer can play it a little safe. You create a MyPlayer again and embark on a quest to conquer the PGA Tour (or start at earlier points). The various Archetypes, attributes, skill trees, and customizable equipment may seem overwhelming, but there's some incredible atmosphere and gameplay to experience.

So it's a shame that such a significant chunk is hindered by the progression, which has seen massive nerfs to the amount of VC players can earn. Don't get us wrong - PGA Tour 2K25 stands strong in many areas that matter, but less stingy progression would have gone a long way.

Given the success that radical reimaging style remakes like Resident Evil 2 and (to a lesser extent) Silent Hill 2 have enjoyed, it’s understandable that many were hoping that that was the path that Konami would pick for a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3. 

The fact that the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is being billed as a conventional remake that will stick closely to its source material may have, as such, caused some disappointment for many- though that decision may also end up enabling the remake to prove once again just how timelessly perfect the original Metal Gear Solid 3’s stealth design is.
