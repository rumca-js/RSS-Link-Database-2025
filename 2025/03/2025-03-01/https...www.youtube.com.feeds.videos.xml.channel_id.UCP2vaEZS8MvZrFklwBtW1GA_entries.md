DITRA heat mat tips…I shop vac and clean the plywood. Then I install the mat and activate the pressure-sensitive adhesive with a float. These are DITRA-HEAT-PS mats that don’t require mortar. The substrate can also be primed with PRIMER-PS, which I recommend for substrates with residual mortar, paint, etc. Many thanks to Schluter for providing materials for my client’s removal ❤️#heatedfloors #bathroomrenovation #homerepairtutor #diy #brandpartner
