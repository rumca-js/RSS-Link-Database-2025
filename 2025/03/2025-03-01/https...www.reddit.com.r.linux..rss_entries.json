I&#39;m talking about software compatibility, and that&#39;s what worries me. Will most of the programs we use on Linux today have ARM versions? For example, Proton itself would already have to be completely reworked. Other completely random programs (e.g. Microsoft Teams) probably wouldn&#39;t get ARM versions because the company would definitely not give a single shit. How do you see the future of Linux on ARM? Even MacOS itself suffered a lot from compatibility issues during the Intel to M1 transition, and even today, 5 years later, there are still some programs that are not adapted to Apple Silicon, and others are a compatibility mess. For example, Minecraft 1.9+ has compatibility with Apple Silicon, but the launcher is x86, running by emulation. I won&#39;t even talk about Windows ARM because the mess is even bigger.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",

I have to use it with work. I work with a &quot;version&quot; of FreeBSD on specific hardware, but I need to use Windows for everything else. </p> <p>However, this past week I&#39;ve tried to run Windows on my home PC. I wanted to mod some games I really enjoy and this is much easier on Windows. However, what I&#39;ve learned this past week is that, i&#39;d much rather not play those games and mod them, and just go back to Linux. </p> <p>is this just me just not willing to change? I&#39;m wondering if I like Linux because it&#39;s what I&#39;m use to. </p> <p>I know this is funny to post to a Linux subreddit, but there has got to be more p",
