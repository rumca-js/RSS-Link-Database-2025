Docker containers are amazing.</p> <p>Not in IT or anything so only just got around to installing an instance of dockge on my home server and fired up a couple of containers and it was seamless.</p> <p>Have been using TrueNAS Scale, so up until recently I was using the Kubernetes apps but with the most recent update they actually removed support for these. Happened during the week and was not looking forward to going through and recreating my home server.</p> <p>Left it for the weekend, as when I first set this all up it took pretty much the whole day. This is where my appreciation really comes in.</p> <p>Within an 1-2 hours I am back up and running everything I had. Not only this, it all just worked right away! No trouble shooting, just start back to everything back online and working.</p> <p>Mind you not the most complicated set up, but as I mentioned took forever before.</p> <p>So shout out to all the",

The setup was quick and easy, and the service worked flawlessly from day one. </p> <p>Here\u2019s what impressed me the most:</p> <p>No Buffering I\u2019m a huge sports fan, and there\u2019s nothing worse than missing a crucial moment because of streaming issues.
