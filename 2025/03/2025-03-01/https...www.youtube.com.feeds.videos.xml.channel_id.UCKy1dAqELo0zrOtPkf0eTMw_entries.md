## Daredevil: Born Again Stars Promise to ‚ÄòBlow Up‚Äô the Netflix Past | Interview

‚ÄúWhy did you stop being a vigilante?,‚Äù Wilson Fisk asks his old nemesis Matt Murdock in the first trailer for Daredevil: Born Again. ‚ÄúA line was crossed,‚Äù Matt cryptically responds as the trailer depicts Daredevil‚Äôs cowl falling from the roof of a building. But, as the Marvel show‚Äôs tagline promises, the devil‚Äôs work is never done.
What made Matt Murdock hang up his horns and billy club (even if just for a brief while)? Daredevil: Born Again will explore just that when the series launches on Disney+.
IGN's Scott Collura interviewed Daredevil: Born Again leads Charlie Cox (Matt Murdock/Daredevil) and Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio (Wilson Fisk/Kingpin) and directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead about this hotly anticipated revival. (Yes, it is a revival. Cox says the new Daredevil show is ‚Äú100%‚Äù set in the same continuity as the original Netflix series, which is now MCU canon, with D‚ÄôOnofrio going so far as to label it the fourth season they never got.)
Produced by Marvel Television, Daredevil

Batman fans are currently going through a bit of a drought when it comes to new live-action movies. The Batman Part II was recently delayed until October 2027, meaning there‚Äôll be a five-and-a-half-year gap between the original and the sequel. Nor does DC seem to be making much progress with The Flash director Andy Muschietti‚Äôs Batman: The Brave and the Bold. We can certainly respect James Gunn‚Äôs mandate that DCU projects not move forward until the scripts are ready, but that doesn‚Äôt make the wait any easier.

But there is one piece of good news on the Batman movie front. After months of speculation that DC might opt to merge the two projects and make Pattinson‚Äôs Bruce Wayne the official Batman of the DCU, Gunn has put his foot down. Pattinson won‚Äôt be joining the DCU. Instead, The Brave and the Bold will introduce a brand new cinematic incarnation of the Caped Crusader. 

This is definitely welcome news. As much as we love Pattinson‚Äôs Dark Knight, he‚Äôs not really cut out to share th
