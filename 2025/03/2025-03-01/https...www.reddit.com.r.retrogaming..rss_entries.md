However, i have yet to find a wireless NES controller that utilizes the SNES controller ports. I have an 8bitdo NES controller but that can only plug in to NES controller ports, or a USB port. </p> <p>I was thinking that if there was an adapter that plugged into the SNES controller port (male) and on the other side had a female USB port, that might work, but the only product i could fin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hello everyone, I&#39;m looking for the name of a video game that I played when I was young (mid-90&#39;s). It&#39;s an arcade-style first-person shooter. We saw the ammunition on the screen but it was not in the form of a number but rather of cartridges drawn one on top of the other on the side of the screen. also, if I remember correctly, we couldn&#39;t walk in the game. It was more of a fixed screen on which we saw our crosshair and we had to kill all the enemies before moving to the other screen. I remember we couldn&#39;t reload our rifle until all the bullets were fired. the shotgun was OP and one of the bosses was a helicopter. this game probably came from a CD from a magazine such as PC-mag or PC-gamer. also, it was in MS-DOS. Can you help me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/samspeed4"> /u/samspeed4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j0zvsv/looking_f

I don&#39;t see it mentioned much but I found myself really liking it.</p> <p>The world is huge (you sometimes run for 20-30 minutes to get to the next town or point of interest), the gameplay is very unforgiving (if one of your party members dies it&#39;s good bye to them - and forget about respeccing your stat points) and the game often feels like a Baldur&#39;s Gateish RPG.</p> <p>Story is compelling and the battle system is a bit awkward at first but quickly grows on you.
