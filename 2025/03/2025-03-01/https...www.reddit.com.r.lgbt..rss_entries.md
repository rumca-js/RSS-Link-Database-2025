<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was a mantra I heard attributed to Dan Savage, regarding the peak of the AIDS crisis. It offers a good framework for how we can survive these next few years. Face the reality that we&#39;re living in, the very real dangers that we&#39;re facing now and that are coming. Stay informed as much as you can, to where it&#39;s not severely negatively affecting your mental health. Fight back however you can. Help build an accepting community, help your local community, download the five calls app and spam your representatives, join protests, donate to Bail funds. And try to find joy where you can, allow yourself to have moments of fun and joy. We rotate soldiers out of active combat, do you think that you do not deserve the same? These are scary times and we need to be here for each other and I think we can learn from similarly dark times in our history for how we can weather this storm.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:/
