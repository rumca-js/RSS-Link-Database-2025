<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Roxy Music is a decently known band, but not super popular. Their last album Avalon in 1982 was probably their best Album, and the song &quot;Avalon&quot; on that album is one of the most underrated songs ever imo. It is not some completely obscure song, but I still feel like it is generally underrated compared to other popular 80&#39;s music/songs and is not nearly as popular as it should be. The song has a very atmospheric after-party like feel, is about unattainable love; the sound is both dreamy and at times also melancholic(especially the guitar in the middle). I personally think it is a soft rock masterpiece in many aspects.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpA_5a0miWk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpA_5a0miWk</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Calm_Set5522"> /u/Calm_Set5522 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j19xt1/avalon_by_roxy_music_is_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been curating and listening to new music for over 30 years, and have countless favourite albums and songs, but there are occasionally I think, songs that we love so deeply that some would choose not to listen to the song at all, for fear of wearing it out. Or perhaps, to just listen to a part of it, and let the rest of it run from memory.</p> <p>I think this is a very interesting and special topic, that other devoted musicians/listeners likely experience. Certainly, intense emotional response (intensely positive, or negative) is a reason to actively guard or deny a particular song/album, and that&#39;s certainly the case I&#39;m referring to (in the positive sense!).</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if this is the right subreddit for it, as the rules keep reminding me we shouldn&#39;t share favourites or recommendations.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: I&#39;m actually asking about the most genre-defying musicians. Correcting here since I can&#39;t change the title.</p> <p>This question has occured to me before, but renewed yesterday...we were in the car and listened to a few Beck songs and my son (8yo) asked us what kind (genre) of music Beck was considered to be. Of course the answer is essentially that he is genre defying across the breadth of his career. David Bowie is another artist (possibly THE artist) who most exemplifies this and it got me thinking I should ask this sub for opinions on their thoughts on this, and what artists others would consider in this conversation.</p> <p>If you have a few that would be great, ranking them is totally optional and likely futile!</p> <p>Edit: Thinking further on my own question, it feels like Radiohead has to be in this conversation, though that is more of a collaborative effort than singular creative power like the previous 2. </p> </div><!-- SC_O

## How has "Never Mind the Bollocks" aged so well?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In terms of the sound production and mixing and overall effect, Never Mind the Bollocks by the Sex Pistols sounds a lot more contemporary than a lot of other records from the 70s and 80s. It doesn&#39;t have the obviously dual-tracked vocals that a lot of 70s records have, the guitars are incredibly fat and full and everything sounds crystal clear. How did a record made by an amateurish punk band end up sounding 30 years ahead of its time? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/99thLuftballon"> /u/99thLuftballon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j0y2wa/how_has_never_mind_the_bollocks_aged_so_well/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j0y2wa/how_has_never_mind_the_bollocks_aged_so_well/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard a single song from him. Honestly I had a prejudice against the album cover. Every time I looked at it there was a specific sound that came to mind. A boring bluesy/r&amp;b with a little bit of pop here and there album kind of thing.</p> <p>But I kept seeing it in every list of the best albums. A lot of people recommended it on Reddit and other sites. It was one of the albums that popped up every once in a while in every collector&#39;s vinyl collection that I stumbled upon.</p> <p>Maybe this shows the power of an album cover (which I came to find was the thought of the execs when the album was released, ironically enough). Or just simply my own biases. But I really really struggled to find any kind of interest on it.</p> <p>But a few days ago I just gave it a go. I was so wrong about it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Earlier this week I was listening to my “liked” songs in Apple Music and I stumbled upon one of the songs from the album. I don’t even remember which one. But since then I have had the album on repeat while driving for like the last four days. Not sure if I am just nostalgic, because I owned the CD when it first came out, but I think it may be one of the only albums I can listen to without skipping a single song. Yes, most of the lyrics are pretty childish, but I think that makes me love it even more. It also just seems incredibly tight and well produced and I think I can appreciate the pure musicianship so much more now than when I was a kid. Just wanted to share my newfound blink appreciation with everyone. - P.S. - Your mom’s a wh*re. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/falafel_larry"> /u/falafel_larry </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1j0qqfw/enema_of_the_state_is
