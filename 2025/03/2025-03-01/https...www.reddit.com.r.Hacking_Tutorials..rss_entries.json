So far, so good. The problem is that, moving forward in the video, he explains that he put some &quot;dummy&quot; files (PDF, batch, EXE, etc.) that, when opened, send a request to the Flask server. Furthermore, it created a warning screen that says this is a social experiment. So my two questions are:</p> <p>1) How did he create PDF files, batch files, and EXE files capable of sending requests to the Flask server? I don&#39;t think he used Python because not everyone has Python on their computer. 2) How did he show the warning screen every time the user opened one of those files?</p> <p>I hope you can help, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
