<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have vive tracker 3.0s and 1.0 base stations. For some reason whenever I first plug in the base stations, the tracking is completely unusable. After about an hour of the base stations being plugged in the tracking is perfect. I don&#39;t have to be in VR I can literally just plug in my base stations an hour before I want to get on VR and it&#39;s fine. I just leave them plugged in all the time now so I don&#39;t really have this problem anymore but it does plague me from time to time when I need the outlets for something else or we have a power outage from a storm. Does anyone else have this issue? I put rugs all over my floor to cover up my hardwood flooring and it helped a little? I have my dongles on opposite sides of my room. (I have tried putting them all directly into my computer because I thought the usb extensions were causing it but still had the same issue) I do have two access points in my room tho. Both having a 2.4ghz band that COUL

However, I&#39;m also a DJ, and I want to make a helmet/costume to wear when doing sets, using FPV cameras and a lensed display. I found a setup that lets you use a smartphone VR setup with a pair of FPV cameras to do real-time stereoscopic passthrough, and I plan to build the helmet around it if I can&#39;t find a better alternative that lets me remote-mount the cameras.</p> <p>The one problem I&#39;m concerned about is how far the uber-cheap smartphone VR &quot;headsets&quot; stick out from the face! I want to have the helmet be a reasonable size, meaning I need a very thin setup. Does anyone know of such a thin smartphone setup (or really, any stereoscopic FPV device)? Hopefully under $50 if such a thing exists, but with some saving I could go higher if absolutely necessary.</p> <p>(No, it&#39;s not goi

If you have any experience with AR coding, is this what you would recommend? Also, do you have any recommendations on which AR glasses/goggles I should use with my code? I don’t have any previous experience coding and am trying to learn ASAP.

If I peak out of my headset and look at my monitor, my frames are fine and movement is smooth. What can I do stop this from happening?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been researching different headsets to find the best upgrade from my Rift S, which I&#39;ve been using for nearly six years (march 2019). It&#39;s finally showing signs of wear, so I’m in the market for a replacement.</p> <p>I primarily use my headset for content creation and full-body tracking (currently using vive trackers), so I have no issue with wired options. My budget is around $2,000 USD. I&#39;m trying to avoid Meta headsets due to personal preference, but if they truly offer the best experience, I’m open to considering them.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking at the Focus Vision, but I’ve seen mixed opinions on whether it&#39;s worth the price. I&#39;d love to hear any recommendations—thanks in advance! Also if the tag on the post is wrong I do apologize as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmoUnavailableCheese"> /u/EmoUnavailableCheese </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddi
