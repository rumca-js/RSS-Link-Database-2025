He is NOT tech savvy at all, or dishonest. He has a new woman living with him who seems to have gone into that account and not only removed his exes profile, but found a way to create her own profile that she created a passcode for and locked. </p> <p>So now my dad\u2019s ex was told by Amazon that because she gave someone access to the account a long time ago, there is no way to remove that other person\u2019s locked profile without deleting her entire account. It won\u2019t even show that other profile when she goes to the manage profiles section and because there was a password made for it that she doesn\u2019t know, there is no option to enter the profile. Is there something her or Amazon are missing? It seems crazy that someone could lock someone out of accessing anything on their own account that they pay for",
