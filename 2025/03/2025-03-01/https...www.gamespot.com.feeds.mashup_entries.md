<p>The annual Toy Fair expo has kicked off, and as you'd expect, Lego has a big presence at the convention. One of the new licensed sets revealed this weekend is the Avengers Endgame: Final Battle diorama, a new kit that captures one of the biggest moments from the final film in the Infinity Saga, where Earth's mightiest heroes and their allies band together in a last-ditch effort to stop Thanos from claiming the Infinity Gauntlet.</p><p>This set lets you build a mini replica of the devastated Avengers headquarters where the exciting clash takes place. You'll also get mini figures of the heroes Captain America, Iron Man, Ant-Man, Wanda Maximoff, Doctor Strange, Iron Spider, Black Panther, and Falcon, plus a Thanos figure to complete the scene. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4452165-avengersset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452165" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image" style="wi
