But, as the Marvel show\u2019s tagline promises, the devil\u2019s work is never done.\nWhat made Matt Murdock hang up his horns and billy club (even if just for a brief while)? Daredevil: Born Again will explore just that when the series launches on Disney+.\nIGN's Scott Collura interviewed Daredevil: Born Again leads Charlie Cox (Matt Murdock/Daredevil) and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio (Wilson Fisk/Kingpin) and directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead about this hotly anticipated revival. (Yes, it is a revival. Cox says the new Daredevil show is \u201c100%\u201d set in the same continuity as the original Netflix series, which is now MCU canon, with D\u2019Onofrio going so far as to label it the fourth season they never got.)\nProduced by Marvel Television, Daredevil",

The Batman Part II was recently delayed until October 2027, meaning there\u2019ll be a five-and-a-half-year gap between the original and the sequel. Nor does DC seem to be making much progress with The Flash director Andy Muschietti\u2019s Batman: The Brave and the Bold. We can certainly respect James Gunn\u2019s mandate that DCU projects not move forward until the scripts are ready, but that doesn\u2019t make the wait any easier.\n\nBut there is one piece of good news on the Batman movie front. After months of speculation that DC might opt to merge the two projects and make Pattinson\u2019s Bruce Wayne the official Batman of the DCU, Gunn has put his foot down. Pattinson won\u2019t be joining the DCU. Instead, The Brave and the Bold will introduce a brand new cinematic incarnation of the Caped Crusader. \n\nThis is definitely welcome news. As much as we love Pattinson\u2019s Dark Knight, he\u2019s not really cut out to share th",
