								<p>The reworked <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> Artificer received its second round of playtesting in an Unearthed Arcana document from February 27. Along with plenty of small tweaks, Wizards of the Coast has further tinkered with its tinkerer by adding a new subclass. The Cartographer is a map-making Artificer whose only real talent seems to be teleporting a lot – and on a first read, it doesn’t inspire much excitement.</p>

								<p>There’s a brand new price spike on the horizon, as The Enigma Jewel leaps up in price with a 383% spike. This artifact card looks like a brewer’s best friend, but it’s failed to find a spot in any competitive decklist, so has sat costing just $1 for most of its existence.</p>
<p>Until early this year, that is, when it started to trend steadily upwards. Since <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/aetherdrift-release-date">MTG Aetherdrift</a> launched, Enigma Jewel has skyrocketed from $1.80 to $8.70, with most of the growth happening over the last three days.</p>

								<p>The <strong>Warhammer 40k Emperor’s Children codex</strong> for 10th edition is a confident debut for this army of warp-addled hedonists, sybarites, and dissolutes. It captures the theme of the Third Legion perfectly, a rabble of vainglorious psychopaths who don’t play nicely with one another, but can close on their enemy and dismember them in the blink of an eye. The unit list, however, may strike some fans as inappropriately restrained.</p>
