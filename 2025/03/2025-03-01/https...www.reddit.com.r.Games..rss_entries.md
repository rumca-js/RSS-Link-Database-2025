<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Games like Final Fantasy IX, Atlyss, and Tails Noir are good examples of what I&#39;m talking about. They can be serious or funny or a mix of both. Sly Cooper, the Sam &amp; Max series, Undertail, etc. I&#39;m both curious as to what else is out there plus I though it would be cool to see what &#39;furry&#39; games people have played that they liked a lot. </p> <p>Anthropomorphic characters have a long history of being made video game characters. One of the very first games I ever got into was Kangaroo in the arcades, and I still think a game based on The Secret of NIMH would rock. What&#39;s an anthro-themed character or game YOU like?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ziddersroofurry"> /u/ziddersroofurry </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1j1a3h1/looking_for_good_games_with_furryanthropomorphic/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/
