<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, Padda here.</p> <p>For a while now we have seen a lot of posts on this Reddit that have been extremely pro Trump, JD Vance, and Elon Musk. The last couple of days though, I’ve seen a lot of posts that lean contrary to this. JD Vance said something stupid while they were in discussions with president Zelensky, and we’ve seen a lot of posts about this on this Reddit. There’s also been a few posts about some of Trump’s latest decisions being quite “interesting” for lack of a better word—I’ve also seen quite a few people upset by this shift. But THIS shows me that all the accusations against Asmongold and his fan base being purely right-wing conservative wrong. this is very important for any community to allow this level of thinking and it encourages rationality and critical thinking. I’m a huge fan of this and I don’t think this community should never lose this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

You may disagree with the US sending money overseas, and you may disagree with him for other reasons, but this is still a man who is fighting occupation against RUSSIA of all countries. If you were getting bumfucked by Russia, wouldn’t you also do all in your power to ensure your country’s survival?
