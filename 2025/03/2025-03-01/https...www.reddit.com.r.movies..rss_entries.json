Nothing too silly either, something that does tug on the heartstrings a bit with good characters, told from a female perspective is nice too. </p> <p>Here are some examples of movies that she likes: - best exotic marigold hotel (2011, 2015) - calendar girls (2003) - guernsey literary and potato peel pie society (2018) - Brooklyn (2015) - she liked Downton Abbey (I know it\u2019s a show) </p> <p>I appreciate all suggestions!

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My wife and I noticed a particularly specific trope while watching Despicable Me 4 tonight. An old man with a dog is sitting in front of a remote gas station when an extraordinary vehicle (space ship, high tech car, huge bus, etc.) arrives. A regular person exits the vehicle to do normal gas station things while the old man stares in stunned silence and the dog usually runs to hide. It\u2019s not the creepy gas attendant trope. It\u2019s always done as a comedic moment. We were wondering where this trope started from. If this isn\u2019t the place to ask, would you please point me in the right direction? I tried tvtropes but all I got from there is the creepy gas attendant trope.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DreadPirateZoidberg\"> /u/DreadPirateZoidberg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j0qv8a/source_of_a_particular_movie_trope/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://",

I was thinking about other films and tv shows that have intense scenes like the flanking scene, and came up with a few. I&#39;m posting to see what ya&#39;ll can add to my small list so far.</p> <p><strong>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi</strong> (2016)<br/> - I&#39;m watching this right now and the movie manages to maintain such intensity throughout, i just love it.</p> <p><strong>Sicario</strong> (2015)<br/> - The border crossing scene is so great.</p> <p><strong>Heat</strong> (1995)<br/> - I haven&#39;t rewatched in a while, but i do remember the big shoot-out scene as being pretty intense. It&#39;s time for a rewatch i think.</p> <p><strong>Bone Tomahawk</strong> ",

Ridley Scott\u2019s Director\u2019s cut has clarity, pace, and depth. The theatrical edition is a hack and slash film cut to have a start and an end. I recommend the first if you want to be on the edge of your seat for 3 hours! </p> <p>Other missing details: </p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Balian and his wife lost a baby in the beginning, she killed herself because of it, Balian was placed in custody for madness in his grief. He burned the baby\u2019s unfinished shirt she had been sewing before killing his brother in a rage. This shows why he felt he had nothing left and went on the crusade. Also, Balian had other family in the crusades, including his uncles! His father\u2019s backstory is further discussed and there is an entire plot about Sybilla and her son being king Baldwin that is left out</span></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",
