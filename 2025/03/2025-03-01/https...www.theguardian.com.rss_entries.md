<p>Veteran director, who originally opposed adapting 1967 film for the stage, is ‘very proud’ as Menier Chocolate Factory production will move to London’s Garrick theatre</p><p>The Menier Chocolate Factory has announced that its acclaimed production of The Producers is to transfer to the West End this autumn. Having sold out its three-month run at the 180-seat London venue before first night, it is set to move to the Garrick theatre. But according to its original creator Mel Brooks, the musical might never have happened at all.</p><p>The 98-year-old Brooks has told the Guardian he was initially reluctant to adapt his 1967 movie for the stage.

One February morning, a dozen of us took a hungover walk to the beach. It was overcast and blustery, and we had come to skinny-dip. I was buoyed up by the camaraderie and games of the night before, and felt a safety in numbers. People stripped off, actions hastened by the wind, and before I could think, I followed. We ran over sand and pebbles and dived into the oncoming waves. It was a total sensory overload. Salt filled my nose and mouth. I heard shrieks and cursing, and so much laughter. As I emerged there was a surge of adrenaline, and I couldn’t stop giggling. It was sca

<p>As his goons root through the innards of the US government, Tesla sales are plummeting, the cars are being defaced and owners are ashamed</p><p>Extreme wealth has always played a role in democracies. Money has always talked, especially in the US. Years ago, Lawrence Lessig, the great legal scholar, calculated that most of the campaign funding for members of Congress and aspiring politicians came from one-twentieth of the richest 1% of Americans – about 150,000 people. This is about the same number as those who are named “Lester” <a href="https://lessig.org/product/the-usa-is-lesterland/">and explains the title of his book</a>: <em>The USA </em><em>Is Lesterland</em>.</p><p>But that particular corruption of American politics only involved billionaires like the Koch brothers playing organ-grinders to congressional monkeys.

It still haunts her. She recalls being a sociable child, good at making friends. But she also remembers becoming hyperfixated on one friend, then another and another in succession. She tended to be impulsive and, wanting to please others, easily led. One distressing incident in particular has never left her. On the first day after moving to a new school, she was relieved to be taken under the wing of two girls. At lunchtime, in fits of giggles, the girls egged each other on to do naughty things. Anna spat orange juice at the boys. She did it with relish, only to reproach herself later. She feels the episode coloured her whole school experience.</p><p>As a child and an adult, Anna felt sanctioned, judged and misunderstood.

Shredding the filo and mixing it with the filling gives a cake-like effect and a great rise, and creates the magic of multiple layers without really having to do any work. Yoghurt is a staple in Kurdish and Turkish meals; the acidity cuts through dishes and works so well in soups, which is why one of the most classic soups in our regions is <em>yayla çorbası</em>, simply made with yoghurt and cracked white rice and topped with a mint butter. There are many different regional iterations but this is mine, with chickpeas and spinach, and topped with bulgur köfte in mint butter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/01/borek-cake-and-yoghurt-soup-recipes-melek-erdal">Continue reading...</a>

It is also true that pesto is a hard thing to preserve in a jar in a way that tastes nice. This is especially true if you are working to keep costs down – as consumers, we can all do ballpark sums for the cost of herbs, nuts, cheese and olive oil. I think one of the problems lies with the herbs’ tendency to get a bit muggy during processing, though some makers are doing quite a good job.</p><p>Just to be clear about nomenclature: pesto, from the Latin <em>pestare</em>, meaning to pound, is a generic word for a whole group of similar mixtures, the general guidelines being to mix any herb with any nut and with any cheese, then

But, until my mid-20s, it didn’t cross my mind that someone like me could become a doctor. There were no medics in my family. I was slow at maths and science, and gave them up before the age of 16. After school, I decided on an English degree, because it was what I found easiest.</p><p>Then, in my final year, something important happened. A few of us were hanging out at a friend’s house one evening when his dad, a surgeon from London, arrived to stay for the weekend. Over dinner, we all sat enthralled as he told us stories of his hospital life. He fetched a surgical textbook from his bag, full of photos of some of his favourite operations, and I remember sitting at the kitchen table late into the night, poring over these luminous images, skin peeled back to reveal muscle
