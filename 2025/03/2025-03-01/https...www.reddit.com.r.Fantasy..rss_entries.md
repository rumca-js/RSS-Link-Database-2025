That got me wondering - why do we read and love Hobb?</p> <p>My take on it - Hobb tells our stories. Most of us are no heroes, most of us are a bit broken, trying our best to be good, but often not making it. We make mistakes, we break down, and still life requires us to march on. We feel the pain of letting a dog go to sleep, of losing family members and friends. Our love stories are not perfect, our best so often fall short. Yet still we march on, we hope, we dream, we live.</p> <p>Hobb is telling it as it is: honest, painful and with only the barest glimmer of hope. We cry with Fitz, because we&#39;ve been him. Our hearts break anew in echo with older scars. And mirrored in Fitz&#39;s fate we see ourselves hoping to arrive at and ending to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi friends!</p> <p>So this might crossover somewhat in sci fi recommendations as well but I’ll take whatever recommendations there are and really am looking for fantasy books. One of my favorite character types of tropes I’ve noticed in some of my favorite stories on tv and in books are characters who go from being rigid, cold, lifeless and aren’t human, to by the end of the book or their story they’re able to experience human empathy. Like Violet Evergarden (although she is human just trained as a killing machine). Stories that explore human sentience and self consciousness in ghost in the shell and the thunderhead in Neal Schusterman’s Scythe series or even experiencing empathy or emotions for the first time as a non human being. </p> <p>The problem is I can’t find any books in a fantasy setting with a main character or protagonist that fits this description. I’ve read a lot of other Reddit threads but none of the book recommendations seem to fit w

I usually enjoy slow, character-driven fantasy—The Name of the Wind is one of my favorites—but for some reason, I found it difficult to stay engaged. I did love the melancholic atmosphere of the book, but I wasn’t sure if the story picks up later.</p> <p>Does the series gain momentum as it progresses?

Similarly princess what’s-her-name can see the future and thus is incapable of having normal, spontaneous interactions with friends and family. </p> <p>So I guess I’m looking for similar stories, where a characters power is both a blessing and a curse.

At that point I had about 70,000 words of Dead Empire written and a complete outline for the book, as well as extensive notes for book three (Demon War).
