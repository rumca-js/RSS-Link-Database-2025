<p class="has-text-align-none">Google Photos makes backing up photos and videos from your phone pretty seamless: set it to work in the background and all your precious memories are saved to the cloud without you having to do anything else.&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The smoothness of this process does tend to mean you can find yourself with a rather gigantic collection, however &acirc;&#128;&#148; which then creates its own problems when it comes to finding specific items in your ever-growing library. But even if you have a photo library spanning decades, there are tools to help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of all of my favorite games, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> might be the hardest to describe. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a rhythm game, but also you ride on a motorcycle and a dragon, wield giant swords while dodging fireballs, and teleport to a retrofuturistic VR world. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s structured like a pop album, telling a story of love and loss, and is narrated by Queen Latifah. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s <em>Tony Hawk&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Pro Skater</em> meets <em>R-Type</em> crossed with <em>Rhythm Heaven</em> as directed by Carly Rae Jepsen. It makes sense once you play it, trust me.</p>
