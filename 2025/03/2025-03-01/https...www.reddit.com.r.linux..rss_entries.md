<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, I know Android exists. Yes, I know some desktop Linux distributions already work on ARM. I&#39;m talking about software compatibility, and that&#39;s what worries me. Will most of the programs we use on Linux today have ARM versions? For example, Proton itself would already have to be completely reworked. Other completely random programs (e.g. Microsoft Teams) probably wouldn&#39;t get ARM versions because the company would definitely not give a single shit. How do you see the future of Linux on ARM? Even MacOS itself suffered a lot from compatibility issues during the Intel to M1 transition, and even today, 5 years later, there are still some programs that are not adapted to Apple Silicon, and others are a compatibility mess. For example, Minecraft 1.9+ has compatibility with Apple Silicon, but the launcher is x86, running by emulation. I won&#39;t even talk about Windows ARM because the mess is even bigger.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi
