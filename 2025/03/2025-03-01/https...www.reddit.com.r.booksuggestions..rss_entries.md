Until, when a friend of mine lent me his copy of Fahrenheit 451 to read. I was astonished of what kind of story was being potrayed in the book with Guy Montag and his battle of inner conscious and the world of the &quot;Perfect American Life&quot; with his fire&#39;fighter&#39; job, his relasionship with Clairsse and how she changes him from within. It left me yearning for more. I had decided that, at that moment. I ~~should~~ no, HAD to read more books. So far, I have completed 3 Books, Fahrenheit 451, Tuesdays with Moories and Animal Farm(Borrowed from the school library). Currently reading 1984. I never expected that not even 6 months ago I would be turing into a book finatic.

In a heckuva reading slump and so thinking back to what makes some of my favorite books my favorite.</p> <p>Two of my favorites are Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and Sundial by Catriona Ward which both changed how I viewed everything I&#39;d been reading as the book goes on and more information is given. Both books felt like puzzles where the reward comes from getting a few new pieces dropped which then changes the entire picture.</p> <p>I know many thrillers have twists and I&#39;m certainly open to thriller recs, but I&#39;ll say that books like The Silent Patient were just meh to me because it feels like there&#39;s one big twist and the entire rest of the book is just written around that one twist. I prefer books that layer on new info a little more subtly over time or at least thrillers that you feel are particularly well crafted rather than ones with one big &#39;gotcha!&#39; moment.</p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m being too particular here

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My favorite books are Gone with the Wind, East of Eden. I&#39;ve also enjoyed this about 100 years of Solitude, Wuthering Heights. What do they have in common - especially the first two - they are characterizing not just a set of characters in a given time, but also a &quot;zoomed out&quot; view: a grand narrative about a given generation, or several generations, and about a given family / town / society.</p> <p>This is beautiful and deeply immersive to me, because no character exists in a vacuum. I tend to be anxious / analytical, and having this sort of characterization goes a long way to help me get immersed. On the other hand, it was hard to start Count of Monte Christo, because I am already expected to understand the realities.</p> <p>Ultimately this is not about &quot;birth of a town&quot;, more as it is about an author <strong>going to the length of characterizing the deep societal &amp; generational context of the character</strong>.

I did NOT like fourth wing or acotar, but I am currently reading the 3rd poppy war and have really liked them (not really romance but at least has some good male/female dynamics). I‚Äôd love to find a series that fits this bill! Bonus points if it‚Äôs on kindle unlimited since I pretty much only read on there anymore. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brotherluthor"> /u/brotherluthor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j0pw36/fantasy_series_with_romance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just tore through the book Artemis by Andy Weir and am planning on reading his other two books as well. I also recently (re)watched the movie Interstellar. This has made me crave some more hard sci fi. I would especially like it if it was something a teenager could reasonably enjoy (doesn&#39;t have to be YA, just not something relating to topics that would be completely foreign to someone ~18y/o) and wasn&#39;t something that aged horribly (The Forever War I&#39;m looking at you).
