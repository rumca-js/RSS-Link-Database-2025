I have a question about the rules as we played a bit differently than what is specified in rules in the box. </p> <p>Are you allowed to put multiple answers per question? The way I was taught was yes, so that if you say a word that someone else says (and gets cancelled out) you have your next word to get a point from (if nobody else has it), but it doesn\u2019t specify if you can/cant in the rules. </p> <p>I know you can put multiple words for extra points (e.g. type of dish, letter c, coffee cup), but what i\u2019m wondering is if it is correct to for example put coffee cup AND colander (for the chance that your first one gets cancelled out), or if you have to pick one or the other? </p> <p>Let me know how you play!

Sometimes it&#39;ll make things harder along the way, but ultimately it&#39;s just a countdown.</p> <p>From a design perspective, it seems like a necessary evil for any game that lets you explore and build or empower your character. Primarily, so you can&#39;t endlessly farm/grind and then steamroll the final encounter. However, I feel the looming race against time element often sours the adventure feel a lot of these games are going for. </p> <p>Are their many/any games that eschew this element and still remain challenging and fun?</p> <p>(For reference, I&#39;m thinking of games like Mistfall, Gloom of Kilforth, Legends Untold.

Maybe it&#39;s because typically the onus has been on me to teach my friends the games we play, but for more involved games, I find myself describing every action I take. For example, playing a game of Nemesis, it usually goes something like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll use my first action to explore here... It&#39;s the Canteen room and it&#39;s on fire. Make my noise roll and... 3. No encounter here. Then I&#39;ll use my second action to...&quot; and so on.

They are very friendly but I feel like a burden not saying any jokes with them or something. What are your thoughts when people join your group but dont give a lot of input. maybe you have some suggestions.

However, we ran into a question about when a hand ends.</p> <p>The simple way is when a player runs out of cards. But a second way is (if I understand correctly) is when a player lays down a set of cards and every subsequent player has to &quot;scout&quot; (pick up a card from the set played) because they cannot beat it. </p> <p>In a four player game someone played a run of five cards, which impressed us all. The next three players could not beat the set on the table, each taking a card, thereby shortening the set. As I understand it, the round then ends? </p> <p>This seemed counterintuitive since it seemed that playing a larger set was good in that you could both capture a long set on the table and garner lots of tokens as people scout from the set you played. But that can lead to the round ending very early! Did we misplay? Or is this part of the strategy?",
