<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I am a highschooler and I made this project to show the impact of industrialization on our air. It is a global average of the 6 largest pollutants of our atmosphere over time. I know it may not seem very impressive, but it took me a while due to the fragmented nature of the data I used. It took a while to get it all together and I believe that there is no other site that shows all 6 in a simple way like this. If I could get some feedback that would be great. Thank you! the link is <a href="https://stateofourair.org/">https://stateofourair.org/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Specialist_Wolf_3185"> /u/Specialist_Wolf_3185 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1j1ayka/i_made_a_website_that_shows_the_evolution_of_air/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1j1ayka/i_made_a_website_that_shows_the_evoluti

While I have over 15 yrs of dev experience with companies and almost 5 years in tech consulting space (which I continue to do so, but is primarily architecture work), I have always been challenged when it comes to UI designs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I built a free AI gradient generator that lets you instantly create and preview gradients for backgrounds, buttons, text, and more. 🎨✨</p> <p>It’s super simple - describe what you want (e.g., “sunset vibes” or “cyberpunk neon”), and the AI generates a unique gradient. You can tweak the colors and copy the CSS instantly or export it as an image.</p> <p><strong>But Eugen, there are tons of tools like this out there!!! Lame 😒</strong></p> <p>Yes, you are right. There are a few reasons why I built it.</p> <ol> <li>Why not? I am not trying to capitalize on it, so I made it free for everyone, and I like making little tools to learn something.</li> <li>There are plenty of tools to generate gradients. However, none of them show a preview of the given gradient in a real-world application, making it hard to visualize. I tried to incorporate a preview of how this particular gradient would look in the UI.</li> </ol> <p>I often find myself just play

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve created an open source electron app called roboserver that can create and run local Rest API servers to help frontend developers test the API endpoints with ease before their actual endpoints are ready.

## Side Project: Another Name for Abandonment?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The history of developers is filled with abandoned side projects that, with the right push, could have turned into the next big unicorn. But the truth is, no one can predict which of these &quot;fetuses&quot; will grow into something groundbreaking. The issue, however, is not just about ideas—it&#39;s about the challenges that kill them off before they ever see the light of day.</p> <p>Among the many hurdles, one of the biggest is the <strong>cost of maintaining cloud infrastructure</strong>. Many side projects are dynamic and resource-hungry, constantly consuming computing power to function. This is where the problem lies: once the project grows, the costs skyrocket, making it unsustainable for a solo developer or small team.</p> <p>So, what should be done? Some have even considered creating a <strong>mesh network</strong> using our own PCs to share resources on a large scale, but is this truly achievable? The idea sounds appealing, but the complexi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been speaking with a lot of entrepreneurs and marketers; and realised that very few consider their branded community as a marketing channel. Those who have existing communities, think of it from a customer advocacy point of view - something that you launch after you have an active community.</p> <p>If you are into SaaS marketing - consider optimising your community for SEO. You can cover a lot of customer pain-points through QnA and once the user signs-up; they are in your ecosystem. You can connect with them, have one-on-one with them, get product feedback and also turn them into your paying customers.</p> <p>Have you considered this approach?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kkatdare"> /u/kkatdare </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1j0qt25/branded_community_as_a_marketing_channel_thoughts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co
