After years of just managing a folder of docker compose files, I decided I wanted something a bit more resilient. I&#39;ve been running this setup for a few years and it&#39;s been flawless. It uses:</p> <ul> <li>Nomad for container orchestration with docker</li> <li>Consul for DNS and service mesh</li> <li>Vault for secrets management</li> <li>Caddy for an HTTP(S) server</li> <li>Consul-template to dynamically generate a Caddy config from my Nomad/Consul services</li> <li>Cloudflared for Cloudflare tunnel (no ports forwarded!)</li> </ul> <p>My setup makes use of several community Ansible roles for super easy deployment. All of my configuration is declared in a few yaml files, and all I need to do to make config changes or provision a new node is run the Ansible playbook.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the post: <a href=\"https://edc.me/posts/homelab-hashicorp-stack/\">https://edc.me/posts/homelab-",

I&#39;ve got everyone in the house synching to cloud storage for off-site backup, but my Intel NUC server with RAID-ified external disks for local backup and media serving isn&#39;t going to cut it any longer. My thought is to buy a consumer-level NAS, which I have no experience with. I need to find something that has an easy-to-use interface and is well documented. Is one brand&#39;s interface more intuitive for a non-expert than another? The primary use will be local backup, but media serving capability (Plex,DLNA) is strongly desired.

It&#39;s similar to tools like Mockoon but my goal is to make it minimalistic and easy to use.</p> <p>I would love to have some feedback on this and iterate further and add more features, if someone out there find this useful.</p> <p>you can find the project here: <a href=\"https://github.com/therealrinku/roboserver\">https://github.com/therealrinku/roboserver</a></p> <p>download here for windows and linux: <a href=\"https://github.com/therealrinku/roboserver/releases/tag/v0.0.1\">https://github.com/therealrinku/roboserver/releases/tag/v0.0.1</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rinkunited\"> /u/rinkunited </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1j0rkgf/c",
