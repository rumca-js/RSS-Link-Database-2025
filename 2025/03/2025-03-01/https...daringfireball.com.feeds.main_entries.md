<p>Nora Deligter, writing for Screen Slate in June 2023, “<a href="https://www.screenslate.com/articles/elegy-screenshot">Elegy for the Screenshot</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About five years ago, Catherine Pearson started taking screenshots
of every bouquet featured on <em>The Nanny</em> (1993–1999), the
six-season CBS sitcom that was then streaming on Netflix. She was
just becoming a florist, and she found the arrangements — ornate,
colorful, and distinctly tropical — inspirational. She now keeps
them in a folder on her desktop, alongside screenshots of flower
arrangements featured on <em>Poirot</em> (1989–2013), the British
detective drama. A few months ago, however, Pearson suddenly found
that when her fingers danced instinctively toward Command-Shift-3,
she was greeted by a black box where her flowers used to be, a
censored version of what she had meant to capture.</p>

<p>It was around this time when streaming platforms like Netflix, HBO
Max, Amazon Prime, and the Criterion Ch

## Meta Apologizes for Error That Flooded Instagram With a Bit of the Old Ultra-Violence

<p>Meghan Bobrowsky and Jeff Horwitz, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta apologized Wednesday night for what it said was an “error”
that led to graphic and violent videos flooding the feeds of a
vast number of Instagram users, including minors. The videos,
which were recommended on some users’ Reels tab, included people
who appeared to have been shot to death and run over by vehicles.
Some of the recommended videos had “sensitive content” warnings on
them while others didn’t.</p>

<p>A Wall Street Journal reporter’s account featured scores of videos
of people being shot, mangled by machinery, and ejected from theme
park rides, often back to back. The videos originated on pages
that the reporter didn’t follow with names such as
“BlackPeopleBeingHurt,” “ShockingTragedies” and “PeopleDyingHub.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s one hell of a glitch.</p>
