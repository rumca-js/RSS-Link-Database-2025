Where is cannot bring up Musk or Elon regarding misinformation for instance.</p> <p>However it can also see that they are the primary source of misinformation. So that got me wondering, is it hard to create an AI that purposefully lies using standard techniques?</p> <p>The thing about lying is you have to remember what you said. It&#39;s expensive. If we assume the data source would have to be filled with factual information by default, how could you modify say Mistral or something open source to suddenly start saying the earth is flat when it&#39;s full of facts that the earth is not flat?</p> <p>How does an AI resolve logical inconsistencies? </p> <p>This is just a thought that bubbled up before I drift off to sleep. Given that a lot of stuff that gets passed around is objectively false, is making a bot knowingly lie much

## Why don't software devs/engineers upskill and become AI/ML engineers (since they're worried they'll be replaced or laid off)?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I come from a country which produces Software Engineers, Coders, Web Developers and IT bros more than any other profession. All I see on social media (including Reddit) is that they&#39;re really worried about AI taking over their jobs. Yesterday the CEO of a software dev company stated in an interview that very soon 80% of their employees will be laid off as they&#39;ve switched to AI automation. Needless to say, most of these professionals are really scared now, and are planning on switching careers, like say starting food delivery businesses, opening restaurants, creating youtube channels and blogs, writing books, etc.<br/> Since AI/ML requires a strong coding and dev base, why can&#39;t they upskill themselves and become AI/ML engineers? It&#39;s not like they have to start from scratch. Is it because of how competitive this field is becoming and how difficult it&#39;d be to get even entry level jobs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I mean…what ya gonna do? These are better than most modern artists with professional production and we could flood the market with these. Are crooning’ humans finished? Sure is looking like it! This is just a limited demo. If this was running full scale the categories would be legion and the songs per category would be too. We can automate more music than mankind has produced in an afternoon, and a unique universe of sound per user. Would you want to generate your own sound universe if we made this a user product instead of what we have planned? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnReasonableApple"> /u/UnReasonableApple </a> <br/> <span><a href="http://mobleysoft.com/music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1j0n3o3/rip_to_the_pop_start_automated_music_labels/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>Part of my job every year is to further develop a personal professional goal. This year it’s to find ways to further leverage gpt’s in my work. My main responsibilities include project management, customer acquisition performance, analysis, reporting. </p> <p>I currently use it for thought starters when creating new systems, processes, or documents. Or for coming up with new CRO ideas, copy, and research. </p> <p>I’m looking for online courses that take me deeper than “what is ai” and how to write prompts. I’d like to look at something like AI agents or going deeper in analytics so I can give my analytics team a break. Do you have any suggestions for something a little more intermediate?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lbgeckos2"> /u/Lbgeckos2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1j0mmsg/intermediate_online_courses_for/">[link]</a></spa
