But when I went to activate the keygen, it immediately started raising havoc about potential Trojans. Windows Defender was having a fit. While I have downloaded VSTs from that place, and most seem to come from TeamR2R, I am still scared that I may download a virus. Believe me, the last time I downloaded a virus, it bricked my family&#39;s PC. So, I am scared for the life of my laptop. So, here&#39;s my question, is Pesktop safe? Can I activate the keygen without fear?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/806mtson\"> /u/806mtson </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1j0of6s/is_pesktop_safe/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1j0of6s/is_pesktop_safe/\">[comments]</a></span>",
