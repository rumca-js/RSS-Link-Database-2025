<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey! I played scattegories for the first time recently and just thrifted it! I have a question about the rules as we played a bit differently than what is specified in rules in the box. </p> <p>Are you allowed to put multiple answers per question? The way I was taught was yes, so that if you say a word that someone else says (and gets cancelled out) you have your next word to get a point from (if nobody else has it), but it doesn’t specify if you can/cant in the rules. </p> <p>I know you can put multiple words for extra points (e.g. type of dish, letter c, coffee cup), but what i’m wondering is if it is correct to for example put coffee cup AND colander (for the chance that your first one gets cancelled out), or if you have to pick one or the other? </p> <p>Let me know how you play!

## Are there any co-op adventure-y games without a 'ticking clock'?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A common element I&#39;ve noticed in a lot of co-op games is a &#39;ticking clock&#39; that ultimately leads the game towards a fail/end state. It often takes the form of a tracker or a series of cards that once depleted, spell the end of the game (regardless of the primary win/lose condition). Sometimes it&#39;ll make things harder along the way, but ultimately it&#39;s just a countdown.</p> <p>From a design perspective, it seems like a necessary evil for any game that lets you explore and build or empower your character. Primarily, so you can&#39;t endlessly farm/grind and then steamroll the final encounter. However, I feel the looming race against time element often sours the adventure feel a lot of these games are going for. </p> <p>Are their many/any games that eschew this element and still remain challenging and fun?</p> <p>(For reference, I&#39;m thinking of games like Mistfall, Gloom of Kilforth, Legends Untold.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking games that you can customize during set-up with modules to ensure a different game experience each time. </p> <p>A prime example of this is Final Girl, where you can select a feature film box to play on different maps against different opponents and inject new mechanics into the game. Another example I can point to is Sentinels of the Multiverse, where each opponent has a different deck and strategy, and each hero has unique and variable powers that you leverage into team synergy. For the record, I&#39;m not talking about games with customized boards/track or deckbuilding - I mean games that have a distinct &quot;modular&quot; component that you can add or remove from the game at your own preference, like the Shift Boxes from Mind MGMT.</p> <p>In short, I love games you can customize before play to drastically change the way the game works - does anybody have any specific favorites they can recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su

Maybe it&#39;s because typically the onus has been on me to teach my friends the games we play, but for more involved games, I find myself describing every action I take. For example, playing a game of Nemesis, it usually goes something like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll use my first action to explore here... It&#39;s the Canteen room and it&#39;s on fire. Make my noise roll and... 3. No encounter here. Then I&#39;ll use my second action to...&quot; and so on.

Theres a purple one that makes you advance a little more (im not certain of this tbh :(... )</p> <p>and then you can spend money to buy more dice and you can choose what dice you roll.</p> <p>Can someone help me pls? i want to play it with my wife.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>edit: i just found it right after doing this post omg... its called Cubitos :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fabmarques21"> /u/fabmarques21 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not looking for conventional card games ment to be played with standard cards, but I am curious if anyone knew of any games that involved regular playing cards that were also deck builders (or could be played solely with playing cards). Where you either assemble a deck from a limited amount of cards or start with a regular deck and splice in cards from other standard decks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Feycromancer"> /u/Feycromancer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j0q45y/deckbuilding_game_but_uses_standard_playing_cards/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j0q45y/deckbuilding_game_but_uses_standard_playing_cards/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It can be hard to pry my small board game group away from Catan, but they seem to like Scout. However, we ran into a question about when a hand ends.</p> <p>The simple way is when a player runs out of cards. But a second way is (if I understand correctly) is when a player lays down a set of cards and every subsequent player has to &quot;scout&quot; (pick up a card from the set played) because they cannot beat it. </p> <p>In a four player game someone played a run of five cards, which impressed us all. The next three players could not beat the set on the table, each taking a card, thereby shortening the set. As I understand it, the round then ends? </p> <p>This seemed counterintuitive since it seemed that playing a larger set was good in that you could both capture a long set on the table and garner lots of tokens as people scout from the set you played. But that can lead to the round ending very early! Did we misplay? Or is this part of the strategy?
