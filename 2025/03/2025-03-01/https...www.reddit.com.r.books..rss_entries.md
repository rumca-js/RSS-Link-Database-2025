<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wrapped up today on another themed anthology edited by Ellen Datlow, &quot;When Things Get Dark&quot;. And the theme for this one? Well, Shirley Jackson of course! These stories in this anthology are inspired by the works of Shirley Jackson.</p> <p>Now these stories aren&#39;t pastiches of Jackson&#39;s, they&#39;re original enough to be their own thing, but the influence is pretty much there to be sure. I&#39;ve loved reading Jackson&#39;s work, from her short stories to her novels. The stories are a mix of mystery, psychological horror and supernatural horror, with settings that look mundane but hide something sinister and, potentially, dangerous. Very reminiscent of &quot;The Haunting Of Hill House&quot;, &quot;We Have Always Lived in a Castle&quot; and some of her short stories, particularly &quot;The Lottery&quot;.</p> <p>The sometimes the stories can have some humor in it, it is all horror and mystery through and through. And a lot of times the

## When a less popular book by an author is better than his popular one.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It happened to you that you first read a popular book by a certain author (whether because of the film adaptation or hitting the right time), which you either considered good, decent or bad. But you decide to read something else from him and come across a book that few people discuss or know. And you think it&#39;s better than the author&#39;s popular book. </p> <p>For example (just an example, not my reading experience), Shirley Jackson. I liked her &quot;The Sundial&quot; more than &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;. I think &quot;The Sundial&quot; is a more intense, interesting and atmospheric book than &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mystery5009"> /u/mystery5009 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j1ap5n/when_a_less_popular_book_by_an_author_is_better/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bo

## When Does Liking Classics Become Pretentious?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love reading classic novels and plays. Literary fiction is my absolute jam most of the time. </p> <p>This definitely started as with a younger, less wise version of me who just wanted to seem smart, but after reading more and more, I honestly think that there is a lot of value in reading older books as well as newer fiction. </p> <p>A good is book is a good book regardless of genre. The way I see it, it is important that we read books with diversity in mind. That means both diversity in place, race, and gender, but it also means diversity of time period.</p> <p>There certainly are people who read classics and make it really annoying and pretentious. However, I do think that most people would do well to read books that predate the current, commercial fiction landscape every once in a while.</p> <p>To me, it becomes pretentious when people act like classic authors are seen as infallible. This is not only annoying, but it prevents readers from honestl

I love this book so much that I entered it and won a contest in high school to have it added to the Summer Reading list. </p> <p>There was a recent thread on this sub about The Outsider, and the OP expressed dismay at a supernatural element being introduced in the book - to which I thought &quot;You were surprised there was a supernatural element in a Stephen King book..?&quot;</p> <p>But obviously while a large majority of his work at least touches on the supernatural, he does have his forays into the more psychological horror, with well known examples like Misery and Cujo. </p> <p>But The Long Walk is just unlike any other.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently read Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro after having read his debut novel, a Pale View of Hills and his most critically acclaimed work, The Remains of the Day, and I am simply blown away.</p> <p>Here is my detailed personal take on this book:</p> <p>I picked up this book because I was drawn to its title. No, not the title itself, but what Ishiguro said about it. During one of his interviews, the writer was asked an interesting question about his approach to choosing titles. What stayed with me was Ishiguro’s response regarding this particular book:</p> <p>“That title ‘Never Let Me Go’ is a stolen one; it’s a famous jazz standard. But what struck me about it is that it is an impossible request. You can ask someone to hold onto you for a long time—that’s reasonable—but ‘Never Let Me Go’ is impossible because something is going to part you. And that’s why I think it’s such a powerful thing to ask for; you fully understand why somebody would as

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>Context: I&#39;m new to this sub Reddit, and very new to the leisure of reading! I&#39;ve never been really one to read books. They always came across very slow and boring. The engagement for me was always something visual in front of me, rather something I could paint in my mind. However I&#39;ve grown a little older and perhaps much wiser, and I found myself with a little more time. So I decided to purchase a couple books that I thought I may enjoy. The first being this one! Flowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes. I must say, it was brilliant! I enjoyed the book so much and it is a great read! (I know this because I found myself feeling emotions of all kinds throughout).</p> <p>I loved it so much, I could not put it down and essentially finished it in 2 days and well....here I am. About 1/3rd through my next book and just so eager to speak to people. Learn from others. Hear what others thought and hopefully engage more with communities on

It wasn&#39;t really, but I feel that way now.</p> <p>But anyway. Apparently Second Class Citizen is the best book she ever wrote. And the closest I can come to comparing the book to something else would be Moll Flanders, by Daniel Defoe. Maybe it should have been called Spunky Nigerian Gal Has Adventures in Living.</p> <p>But it&#39;s a LOT of fun. So much is packed into it, but it&#39;s actually quite a short book, less than 200 pages. Wonderful things happen, then terrible things happen, all colored and flavored by her unique Nigerian Ibo cultural flavorings. It&#39;s basically about a young Nigerian girl who is absolutely hell bent to make it big. Her actual goal changes over the years, of course, but whatever it is in real life, to he

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I loved this book. The conspiracy was flimsy, but the narration and pacing was good enough to excuse that. Even when we get to <span class="md-spoiler-text">mutant meteorite worms</span> Høeg keeps it grounded through great descriptions of ice and brutality, which start page one. Smilla has a sense for both things-- she spends a lot of the book comparing the violence of life in the harsh environment of the Arctic with the violence of Danish society (structural, colonial). </p> <p>I know it was a pretty popular book when it came out, and looking around I can see it&#39;s cited in some papers on postcolonial literature, but I&#39;d be interested to know about its reception in Greenland and Denmark. The language barrier doesn&#39;t help, and the fact that it&#39;s a thriller (as opposed to a &#39;serious&#39; book) probably doesn&#39;t either. Does anyone know where I can look for more information? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h
