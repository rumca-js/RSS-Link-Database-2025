        "description": "<p>I sometimes do a thing when I know that a book is the last in a series I have enjoyed, where I get a hold of it as soon as possible, but then I put off reading it because I don\u2019t want the story to end. I did that with Ed McDonald\u2019s final instalment in The Redwinter Chronicles, Witch Queen of Redwinter. I first discovered McDonald as a writer with the first Redwinter novel, Daughter of Redwinter. I promptly read the second novel, Traitor of Redwinter, and read his completed Raven\u2019s Mark trilogy while waiting for this third book. It\u2019s taken me a little while to brace myself to return to Harranir for the final time and complete this trilogy, but oh boy, the read was worth it. McDonald starts Witch Queen of Redwinter with a very handy synopsis of the events that have come before. So, although you must have read the earlier two books before picking this up, there is no urgent need for a reread. Necromancer Raine, our protagonist, has narrowly escaped execution and finds herself trapped",
