Their next round, that player who jumped up to the third level moves to their level 3 tower, but does not win the game.

In adversarial board games, auctions (like everything else) are zero-sum. Your opponents&#39; gain/loss is your loss/gain, so the payoffs are different, and thus bidding strategies should be different than in positive-sum contexts.</p> <p>Did anyone know of auction theory analysis for zero-sum contexts like board games? Thanks.</p> <p>For example, in a positive-sum sealed-bid first-price auction, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium is you bid what you expect is the 2nd highest valuation, assuming your valuation is the highest. For 2nd price auction, it is early dominant to just bid your valuation. In zero-sum contexts, you would bid more, to decrease the utility of the auction winner.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",

Did I miss a rule?</p> <p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>In my recent games of Brass: Lancashire, one player focused almost exclusively on shipyards and ended up winning by a large margin. Since shipyards provide a huge amount of victory points, it felt like this strategy was a bit too dominant.</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if I missed any key rules that would naturally limit this approach. A few things I\u2019ve checked:</p> <p>Shipyards are limited (only Liverpool and Birkenhead allow them).</p> <p>They require resources (coal for levels 1-2, iron for 3-4).</p> <p>That said, despite these limitations, this strategy still seemed incredibly strong. Are there natural counters that I should be using? Should opponents focus more on denying access to ports or key resources?</p> <p>Would love to hear from experienced players\u2014is this a well-balanced strategy, or does it need to be countered aggressively?</p> </div><!",

My biggest supporter is my girlfriend, who is always willing to play with me always allows me to share my interests with her. To show my appreciation I wanted to get her a custom playmat with our picture, and slots to place cards. I made a similar post to this on the everdell subreddit, because thats her favorite game. But now that i think about it, maybe it would be better to design a layout that can adapt to a lot different games?

The clearest example of this is how in 7 wonders, if you get a card that produces bricks, that means you can buy something that costs 1 brick every single turn for the rest of the game. A similar thing also happens with the gem cards in Splendor, and steel/titanium in Terraforming Mars: Ares Expidition.</p> <p>What word/term would you use to describe this mechanic? Its not really resources/resource management in the classic sense, since you never really <em>spend</em> them. Maybe something like &quot;discounts/discount management&quot;?
