Maybe as containers, no idea, Linux is all new to me, though I&#39;m all for teaching myself as with PCs since 1990-something. :) No media server, just for file backup.</p> <p><strong>My question is: can I get away with a 300W PSU? I&#39;m trying to make this as energy efficient as possible.</strong></p> <p>CPU is 65W-117W, a handful of watts in the mobo, and the rest is just the 3 spinning drives (10W max each)<br/> 300W seems like enough",
