How do old torrents stay alive so long when torrent clients so obviously limit my seed queue to my last recently added 8 torrents which is the default of my torrent client? Are there servers somewhere set up with unlimited seeding connections just in case some smo decides to come along and download something obscure and not frequently downloaded?
