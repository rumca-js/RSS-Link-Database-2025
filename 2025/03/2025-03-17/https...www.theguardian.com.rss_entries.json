Until one day in 2022, stuck in Melbourne traffic, I glanced towards the park in Bayside and saw mist rising from the trees, as if they had just exhaled into the dawn sunlight. This sight cheered me, lifting the pall of the workday grind ahead. Right then I made a resolution to interrupt my commute at least once a week by visiting the park and I have kept to it ever since.</p><p>The next day I left the stream of traffic, parked the car and walked into the park, skirting the cricket oval where dogs chase sassy swallows skimming the grass just out of reach. Past there is a quiet pond where you will find ducks and turtles, and beside it is one of those forgotten patches of land where nature gets to do her thing unhindered.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/17/the-",

Rasmus H\u00f8jlund broke his 21-match goal drought \u2013 dating back to 12 December \u2013 with a composed strike to put Manchester United 1-0 up against Leicester at the King Power Stadium.

You could just sense the relief on the striker\u2019s face as he walked back to the halfway line for the restart. It was also a positive evening for Alejandro Garnacho, who ended his 25-game stretch without a goal, dating back to 28 November. It should give both players a much-needed confidence boost heading into the final stretch of the season. \u201cThe most important thing for me is the work they are putting in, especially defending,\u201d Ruben Amorim said. \u201cThey live for assists and scoring goals.
