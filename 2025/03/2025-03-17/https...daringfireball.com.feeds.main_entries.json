The real question to start with is: Is the\nheart rate function (accuracy aside), even usable? A lot of hours\nlater, I have answers to both of those questions. And trust me,\nit\u2019s a very mixed bag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It\u2019s clear that any movement (even on a stationary bike) quickly\nleads to either dropouts or inaccurate heart rate. And outdoors\nrunning, it\u2019s even worse. Ultimately, I don\u2019t see any value in the\nheart rate sensor in this product, because it\u2019s simply not good\nenough to be useful, even for casual use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<",

By June, most of the board would be replaced, Amelio fired, and Steve Jobs would return as an \u201cadvisor\u201d, and, by the end of 1997, as \u201cinterim CEO\u201d.
