        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It's hard to comprehend that Undertale will be 10 years old later this year. But new audiences apparently keep finding the RPG, as the game broke its own Steam record for concurrent players on Sunday with 11,071 people, per <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/391540/charts/\">SteamDB</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the weekend, Undertale developer Toby Fox shared the Steam record for the RPG <a href=\"https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1901049377134907874\">on X</a>. Funnily enough, Undertale's concurrent players spiked even higher hours after Fox made the social media post. The creator seemingly chalked up the huge boost in players to <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-spring-sale-2025-deals/2900-6318/\">the Steam Spring Sale</a>--which is running now through March 20--as the game costs $1. Usually, Undertale retails for $10 on Valve's storefront.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1901049377134907874\" data-has-image=\"true\"><blockquot",
