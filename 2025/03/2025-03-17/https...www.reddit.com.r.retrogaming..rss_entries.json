You jump on robots and when they explode a bird comes out.&quot; and we all collectively just said &quot;I understand, thank you for the opportunity.&quot; No questions asked. Just happy to be there. It was a simpler time. </p> <p>That&#39;s not to say that Adventure or Adventure 2 are bad by any means they were an enormous part of my childhood, but there&#39;s something side scrolling Sonic games I don&#39;t get anywhere else. Honestly, one of my favorite parts of this hobby is when I have some time to kill but not enough to invest in something lengthy, I&#39;ll just play Sonic on my Anbernic to fill that space.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve tried:</p> <p>*Changing controller</p> <p>*Changing N64 console</p> <p>*Changing power outlet</p> <p>*Changing TV</p> <p>*Changing game</p> <p>But nothing has fixed it. I know that you can press Start + L + R to reset the neutral position again, but I&#39;d rather figure out why it even happens to begin with. I also can&#39;t wrap my head around why a completely different N64 would have the same problem when I try it with a completely different controller too.</p> <p>Does anyone have any idea what the cause can be and what can be done?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JacobARF\"> /u/JacobARF </a> <br/> <span><a h",

They had a huge room dedicated to gaming, going through the history of it. I must have taken 100 photos. I have attached an Instagram post where you can see some, and I can upload more after this without context since this explanation is here now (if people want). If you are in the city, I highly recommend it. They also had a huge area dedicated to the history of film/cinema, and I got to see some of the model cities they used to film Blade Runner 2049.
