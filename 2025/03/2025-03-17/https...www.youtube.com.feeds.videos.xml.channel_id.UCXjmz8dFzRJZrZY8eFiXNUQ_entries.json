        "description": "Zack Snyder\u2019s Snyderverse had a divisive run, but one thing most fans agree on is that Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman was a standout in the DCEU. With his gritty portrayal of the Dark Knight, many were eager to see his solo Batman movie come to life.  But as the DCEU crumbled, Affleck\u2019s vision for The Batman was scrapped, making way for Robert Pattinson\u2019s rebooted version instead. \n\nSo what exactly would a Ben Affleck Solo Batman project have looked like?  Could it have saved the DCEU from extinction, or is it best to leave the past behind and move forward?\n\n\ud83d\udcac Let us know your thoughts in the comments!\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Like, subscribe, and hit the bell for more deep dives into superhero films and the DCEU!\n\n#batman  #benaffleck  #thebatman  #dceu  #dccomics",
