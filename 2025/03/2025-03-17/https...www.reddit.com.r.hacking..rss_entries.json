Questions like this. Additionally, it also helps you to understand about the information that is required for topics like availability, scaling, security etc. But most of the time, it does not explain in-depth about the security architecture of their product, for example: How they are doing IaCs, how they are securing their pipelines, servers, Kubernetes and even if I talk about some pentesting stuff such as API Security, Web Application Security, Cloud Security and what are the challenges.
