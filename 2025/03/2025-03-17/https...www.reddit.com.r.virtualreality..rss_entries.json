The thing is that the game crashes every 5-10 mins when I play with the Quest 3 and Steam link, however when I use PSVR2 with the pc adapter it&#39;s very stable. I try the game with and without mods but the crashes occurs either way. Is there any settings I should tweak to be able to play with the Quest 3? Could maybe Virtual Desktop improve the situation? I played a lot of Skyrim VR moded with Quest 3 and Steam link and never had this kind of crashes... </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SuccessfulRent3046\"> /u/SuccessfulRent3046 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jdp3l7/fallout_4_vr_crashing_with_steam_link/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jdp3l7/fallout_4_vr_crashing_with_steam_link/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;ve just released the first stable version of my package, UXR.QuestCamera, which allows developers to stream images from both of the Meta Quest 3 and 3S&#39;s passthrough cameras in Unity. You can also get each camera&#39;s poses relative to the headset, hardware intrinsics like focal length, skew, and more! It is completely open source and uses an Android native Kotlin plugin (which is also open source) to get all of this data. You can also completely customize the conversion of the camera images from YUV to RGBA, as the package just uses a simple compute shader to do so.</p> <p>This is the GitHub repository of the package: <a href=\"https://github.com/Uralstech/UXR.QuestCamera\">https://github.com/Uralstech/UXR.QuestCamera</a></p> <p>And this is the package on OpenUPM, an alternative to the Unity Package Manager: <a href=\"https://openupm.com/packages/com.uralstech.uxr.questcamera/\">https://openupm.com/packages/com.uralstech.uxr.q",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My first post here, so greetings to the entire community. And hopefully someone can help me with my problem. Long story short, I have two 3D movies stored on my Quest 3 headset, and I can play them directly from Virtual Desktop&#39;s menu, in the Videos section. They play just fine, except that there is no sound, and no option to change anything in Settings. Is there something that I might have missed, or something that I need to look into ? Could this be that Virtual Desktop is not able to decode the sound, or maybe just some specific codecs ? Maybe someone had the same problem and managed to solved it. So any advice is more than appreciated. I will try to copy a few other movies on the headset, even in 2D, and check if they have the same behavior and no sound. Just to check my theory.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/brainbyteRO\"> /u/brainbyteRO </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

But whenever I jump in, I can barely see anything clearly. Even if I do, I can see the RGB pixels.
