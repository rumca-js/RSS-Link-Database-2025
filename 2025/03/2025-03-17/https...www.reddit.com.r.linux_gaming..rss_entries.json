Core Ctrl acted the same except when power limit was toggled it suddenly jumped up to 320-330w. I cant do the same on LACT. Whats going on here? Id like to just use LACT because it runns as a service and has zero fan.

But i think im on to whats going on. Iv read a few posts talking about how Linux reports GPU TDP rather than TBP which is reported in windows. The odd thing here is that it seems to be just rdna3 because other comparisons i see look more on par with windows, such as 6000 series AMD and the newer 9070xt as well. Screenshots iv seen show the same wattage. Back to the TDP vs TBP iv read that a simple equation is TDP x 1.2 = TBP roughly. This lines up perfectly with any 7900xt/xtx videos or screenshots iv seen comparing them to windows. That leads me to the conclusion regarding oc models. My xfx merc can hit 390w sustained with its +15 power slider in adrenaline. In LACT with everything unlocked it gives me a power limit of 333 but ill see max numbers of 292 ish which using that equation leads to of 350w from t",

I would like to thank everyone who is dedicated in forums and supporting everyone who swiches from windows to linux.</p> <p>I made the jump from win10 to Nobara specifically. Since 8 weeks everything runs smooth. Steam was easy, i had some audio issues in the first place but someone posted a solution and i managed to make a script so now i have no &quot;cracking&quot; audio issues. With steam i play last of us, division 2, doom, forza horizon 5, horizon forbidden West, hunt 1896. For some gog and epic games i use the heroic launcher (back 4 blood, death stranding). For star citizen there is an org that created a helper script which guided me perfectly through the installation. For SC i use a warthog throttle and a vkb joystick and both worked out of the box. I wasnt sure if i could use my hue light setup but even that works with hyperhdr.</p> <p>Overall i feel like the whole linux community is very pro active in f",

This seems to become a bit of a pattern with me and Remote Play..</p> <p>On Mint the fix was simply to turn off Hardware acceleration for Remote Play. Great.</p> <p>I&#39;m giving Nobara a try atm, and it seems to have a bigger problem with Remote Play Together.<br/> As in, it won&#39;t launch at all when accepting an invite to a Remote Play session with a friend. All I see is something changes at the top of my Steam Friends list for less than a second and then nothing. </p> <p>I have not done anything except run System Updates from the update manager and installed a few games.<br/> It&#39;s a completely stock Nobara (Official) installation.</p> <p>Specs: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D, 32Gb, nVidia 3080ti, Driver Version: 570.124.04.</p> <p>So, any idea what I need to do to fix it this time? HW Acceleration ON or OFF didn&#39;t do anything. I haven&#39;t tried to disable HW Acceleration for Steam itself yet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

Brawlhalla is one of the games I play often, it&#39;s simple, I enjoy it, and my buddies play it. The issue I encounter is the game plays like it&#39;s running at 20-30 FPS. Confusing thing is the steam fps counter says I&#39;m running at a stable 60 fps. Even at uncapped fps, the game says it&#39;s running at 200+fps but what I see is different. The gameplay is choppy and there seems to be an input delay. There are small moments where the game feels the smoothest it&#39;s ever felt, then boom back to crappy gameplay. I&#39;ve tried chatgpt and going through posts and I can&#39;t find anything that helps. Am I doing something wrong?</p> <p>I got an rtx3060, i7-10700, 32gb ram.
