I find myself being almost totally unable to stay in the moment while reading, i catch myself daydreaming and thinking about other things, almost incapable of paying attention. I think it might just be my fried attention span. Anybody know where to go from here? Any advice? i want to lower my screen time and genuinely pick up reading as a hobby. I want to enjoy it again. </p> <p>On the other hand, book suggestions?? I have no clue what i really even like. I think i&#39;d like a little bit of romance, maybe comedy, maybe something completely random. Maybe some type of mind fuck book, or something about life or crazy weird adventures or just stories.

I wanted to start with a graphic novel because a lot of the students don\u2019t love reading in the first place, and I thought it might get more student to sign up if it was a thick chapter book.

I read it years ago, and it stuck with me. Probably because I\u2019ve been into sci-fi my whole life (I\u2019m in my 70s now, so that\u2019s a lot of sci-fi).</p> <p>The book throws you into a future where consciousness can be transferred between bodies, which raises all kinds of questions about identity, power, and what it really means to be human. I recently talked to my nephew about it (26-year-old), and when I asked him if this kind of tech occurred in our lifetime, would he try it? Surprisingly, he said he wouldn\u2019t do it. The idea of jumping bodies, never really dying he said it felt more like a curse than a gift. Thought it sounded cool at first, but the more we talked about it, the more I understood his perspective. Made me think about how different generations see this kind of tech. When I first read it, I thought, \u201cHell yeah, sign me up.\u201d Now I\u2019m not so",
