It\u2019s the stuff of hacker movies from the \u201890s: one day your keycard, bankcard and phone just stop working, then it turns out someone has taken over your life and is living large on your dime. Far-fetched, sure, but not completely divorced from reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you end up in an identity thief\u2019s sights? Most don\u2019t just select victims at random. Stealing someone\u2019s identity and actually getting away with selling or using it takes a lot of planning, work, and time-consuming operational-security measures. With this kind of risk and time investment in play, it makes sense that identity thieves would want to choose potential victims carefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like law enforcement looking for a suspect, they use various profiling techniques to do this. But first:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc",

A mysterious hacker breaking into a bank account or a con artist slipping through airport security with nothing but a forged passport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in reality, identity theft is far less dramatic and far more common than movies make it seem. Every year, millions of people worldwide find their personal information stolen or misused, often with devastating financial and emotional consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put things into perspective, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission received over a million complaints about identity theft in 2023. These cases, along with other types of fraud, led to financial losses of more than $10 billion, with the median loss per victim being $500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minimizing the risk of identity theft starts with awareness.
