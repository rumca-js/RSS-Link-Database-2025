When I plug in a monitor, everything works fine.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read about using <code>hdmi_force_hotplug=1</code> and setting a headless (VNC) resolution via raspi-config, but on my Pi 5 with the default KMS driver, that option isn\u2019t available or effective.</p> <p>Has anyone encountered this issue?
