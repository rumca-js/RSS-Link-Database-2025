She was a best seller in her day. I couldn&#39;t find any at either of my local libraries, which are quite good, but I tracked one down on Thriftbooks.</p> <p>I&#39;m devouring it. I love her vivid descriptions of nature, and the way she loves each character individually. And I&#39;m a sucker for a good family saga.</p> <p>I wonder why she has fallen so far from popularity. I&#39;m not saying its Great Literature or anything, but IMO they&#39;re still Darn Good Books.</p> <p>Anyone else a fan?

Firstly, I love Nabokov&#39;s prose and style of writing that never ceases to almost carry you as if you were at sea, yet at times his excessive detailing (especially in the book within a book that is chapter 4), felt a little bit draining. Despite this though, I found it a genius work of writing, his ability to shift between perspectives so fluidly, and to be able to change his writing style so many times is very admirable. Anyways, I just wanted to hear others thoughts on the book.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Significant_Try_6067\"> /u/Significant_Try_6067 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jdkapm/the_gift_by_vladimir_nabokov/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jdkapm/the_gift_by_vladimir_nabokov/\"",

Because the military is the military even if it&#39;s 200 years in the future and outer space.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The book is a Pulitzer prize-winning exploration of the daily struggles of a seriously ill schizophrenic patient who spends the majority of her life in and out of New Yourk City and state hospitals. With an unfailing eye to detail, candor and pragmatism, the author touches on the many ways one person&#39;s mental illness can impact how life works within their direct and indirect spheres of influence. All though Sheehan&#39;s indepth study of this patient&#39;s life takes place, primarily, during the 1970s and 80s, it&#39;s timeless as a representation of the perpetual need humans have for the consideration and tangible support of other humans.</p> <p>This book has captured my deepest awareness in ways no other book has or ever will. If you also read it, please share your thoughts. Stellar works of investigative journalism should never be allowed to fade into obscurity when they can still teach us so much. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by ",
