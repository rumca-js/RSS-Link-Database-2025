It has never been that easy to perform a OSINT search on someone with that much data and for that cheap. You also just need to generate an account anonymously with a unique ID and you can get started right away. Currently only Stripe is supported, but crypto payment is coming soon. You can use it to secure your own digital security or perform an investigation.</p> <p>I have read the rules (and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/wiki/advertising_guidelines/\">guidelines</a>) and it doesn&#39;t disallow the sharing of tools. If so, please message me. The site is behind a paywall, just to stop users from exploiting it and to manage my server costs. You can message me and I can give out credits for you to test it and give feedback to me.",
