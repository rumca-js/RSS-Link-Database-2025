        "description": "A genetic study analysing 348 ancient DNA samples reveals that most prehistoric Europeans had dark skin, hair, and eyes well into the Iron Age. Although genes for lighter pigmentation appeared around 14,000 years ago, they remained rare until about 3,000 years ago. Lighter skin may have been advantageous for vitamin D production, while lighter eyes may have developed due to sexual selection. The findings challenge previous assumptions about early European pigmentation and trace the gradual shift in genetic traits over time.",
