I just finished it last night and wanted to share my thoughts here because I really loved this book.</p> <p><strong>Brief synopsis:</strong></p> <p>Once Was Willem follows the story of a young boy (Willem) who dies and is subsequently raised from the dead. I don&#39;t want to get into the &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot; here because I feel like they&#39;re pretty important plot points on their own and don&#39;t want to spoil them.

It presents a thought experiment: an advanced alien race (the Jacksons) is debating the ethics of consuming humans, mirroring our own debates about animal consumption.</p> <p>The book uses satire to explore themes like late-stage capitalism, human impact on the environment, and the challenges of defining and measuring sentience. It even touches on how the precautionary principle (often used in environmental law) might apply to food ethics. There\u2019s a discussion in the book about the \u201cunavoidability of harm\u201d in getting nutrition, which I found particularly relevant.</p> <p>I\u2019ve noticed some thoughtful reflections and discussions on the book\u2019s Goodreads page, particularly around the ethical complexities it raises.

Tbh I\u2019m fine with the 17/23 age gap in a work of fiction, but I read <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">they meet when the younger character is 10/11 and it\u2019s known that they\u2019re mates.</span> That makes me suuupper uncomfortable. </p> <p>Some reviewers seemed squicked out by this too, but a remarkable amount of reviewers don\u2019t mention this at all, which is interesting to me. So I\u2019m wondering if anyone who\u2019s read the book can shed some light on this for me or share your perspective. All opinions are welcome! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chimera_08\"> /u/Chimera_08 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fa",
