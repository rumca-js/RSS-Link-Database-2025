Since the old PC is still good (i7 6th gen, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD), I was thinking about turning it into a lab with many different containers running on it, but what is very important for me currently is setting up my own cloud storage / NAS.</p> <p>I am currently undecided between a NAS or a Cloud. For a cloud or a self-hosted NAS I would probably use the old PC and just add more storage, but I am considering if it might be smarter to buy an actual NAS for this? </p> <p>Especially when I am not at home I still want to access my data, but that leaves more questions open. Important would be what is easier to work with, especially for my use case - what is better backup-wise - and what solution you (as the experts) might recommend ^^</p> <p>Many thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imustbemax\"> /u/imustbemax",

What would you recommend for a self-hosted setup?</p> <p>Also, do you think it&#39;s better to buy a prebuilt NAS or build a custom PC from scratch? And what&#39;s the best way to manage remote file access while maintaining good speeds?</p> <p>I have a personal media server at home, so I have some experience. I was thinking of this stack:</p> <ul> <li>Proxmox -&gt; TrueNAS -&gt; Nextcloud -&gt; VPN</li> </ul> <p>But I always get very low transfer speeds when using a VPN.
