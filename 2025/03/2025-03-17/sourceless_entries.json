Many of you expressed concerns about privacy when I first launched Altbot using Google Gemini, worried about your images being processed on their servers and potentially used for training.\n\nI promised to fix this, and I'm thrilled to announce that Altbot 2.0 is now running entirely on my own hardware using the Ovis2:8B model. Your images are processed locally with absolutely zero data retention - your content never leaves my server and isn't used to train any models.\n\nThe new system is fully GDPR compliant, and descriptions are even better across all 11 supported languages. What's also cool is that the setup is significantly more energy efficient, with 36% of power coming from clean sources. Altbot now even shows you how much energy was used for eac",
