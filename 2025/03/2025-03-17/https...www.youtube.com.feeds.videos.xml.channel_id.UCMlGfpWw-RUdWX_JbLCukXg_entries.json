We will start with the fundamentals of what rvalues are, how to implement and use move semantics correctly, covering the delicate syntax rules, then discuss design considerations and guidelines. We will cover the rule-of-zero, rule-of-three and rule-of-five, the need for std::move and when to use it, as well as forwarding references and std::forward.\n\nBy focusing on the applicability of the subject, and with a clear and concise exploration of the fine details, participa",
