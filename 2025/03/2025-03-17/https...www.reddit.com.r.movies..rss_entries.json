You can tell they were heavily influenced by goodfellas and a lot of Scorsese&#39;s techniques from that movie. I think they use it far better than PT Anderson did a few years later with Boogie Nights where it comes off as copying more than actually creating a homage. The overall stories and characters in both movies are so layered and polished. I think both movies are about how as a society these young men are set up to fail and both movies chronicle their downfalls. </p> <p>Dead Presidents to me is their true masterpiece. Larenz Tate gives what should&#39;ve been a star making performance in this movie. They show brilliantly how in the 60s black men during the war were taken into the Vietnam war when they had absolutely nothing and then chewed up and spit out of the system and sent back into these neighborh",
