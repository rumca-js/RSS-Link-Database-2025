While the C++ Standard Library has a rich set of concurrency primitives and lower-level building blocks, we lack a standard framework for asynchrony and parallelism that C++ programmers desperately need.\nAsynchrony and parallelism appear everywhere, from processor hardware interfaces to networking, to file I/O, to GUIs",
