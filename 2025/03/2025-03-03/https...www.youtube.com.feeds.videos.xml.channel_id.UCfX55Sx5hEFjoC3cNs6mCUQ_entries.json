        "description": "The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) security baseline aims to strengthen open source software security by providing a structured checklist aligned with enterprise security standards and global regulations. It consists of 14 key security measures to help upstream projects improve their security posture while simplifying compliance for downstream consumers. Inspired by frameworks such as the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and NIST Special Publication 800-53, the security baseline provides a clear path for open source maintainers to adopt best practices and enhance transparency for enterprises relying on their software.",
