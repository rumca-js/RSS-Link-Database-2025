<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>(Yes this is in relation to the recent</em> <strong>[</strong>3/2/2025<strong>]</strong> <em>Unleashed static recompilation port)</em> </p> <p>Noticed I haven&#39;t really seen a thread listing software in relation to decompilations and recompilations. For example there&#39;s a GBA awesome dev list on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gbadev-org/awesome-gbadev?tab=readme-ov-file">https://github.com/gbadev-org/awesome-gbadev?tab=readme-ov-file</a>), but there&#39;s not really a dev list on decomps or recomps (probably because it&#39;s more focused on specific emulators and is slowly growing)</p> <p>So I thought why not list the software we&#39;ve seen in relation to decomps and recomps, and list more in the comments and also maybe what future Console specific decomp/recomp software we may see in the future. </p> <p>Take this list and copy and paste it wherever or make a Github/GitLab repository if you&#39;re willing to keep updating it. </p> <p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some quick background. I&#39;ve been around the emulation scene since the very beginning, I remember when Nesticle and all the great work by Marat Fayzullin were showing up hot on local emulation news websites back in the 90s. I&#39;m not well known, my main contributions are probably helping establish some of the retro subs in reddit with Zadocpaet, getting them going, and advocating for wider use of CHDs in emulators for the last decade or so. A while ago I stepped down from most of my mod responsibilities here and let others take over.</p> <p>I noticed over the last couple years that I&#39;m spending a lot of time, I mean <em>a LOT</em> of time setting up systems to be ready to play. Hours upon hours upon hours are spent doing the following:</p> <h1>1. problem statement</h1> <p>1.1. organizing, deduping, compressing, renaming, tagging, archiving, unarchiving, building playlists, cue files, converting, and other similar activities to build a refere
