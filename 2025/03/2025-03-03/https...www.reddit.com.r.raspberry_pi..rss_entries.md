I have a project that needs multiple things to be soldered to the power pin, so I was thinking of soldering one wire to the pin, stripping a small section of the wire, then soldering the other pin to that section. Would that work or is there a different method I should be using?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tinyunknown156"> /u/tinyunknown156 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1j2vf4x/soldering_multiple_wires_to_one_pin_on_a_pico/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1j2vf4x/soldering_multiple_wires_to_one_pin_on_a_pico/">[comments]</a></span>
