To help a small brand that isn&#39;t ranking can out rank top 1-4, you need to do more in SEO \u2014and do it better\u2014than those top competitors, even with a smaller budget and must rank in a short time. That&#39;s why I love using mass backlinks and Pinterest.</p> <p>So, I think for Google, building 100 or even 1,000 links per day could not be a problem.
