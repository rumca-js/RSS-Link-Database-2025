<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m liek totally I obsessed with AI since last year I would have read 100 or so books on AI and most of them academic. I&#39;m at a phase where trying to keep up with the latest literature and lengthy ones like books has become a hassle especially now that I skimread and see a lot of authors trying to use same stuff and buzzwords even in academic books. I am thinking of shifting to using AI summerizer to cuts the noise and focus on the signals yet remain really skeptical of these AIs like the Notebook LLM. So are they any good? I also want to do such an approach with podcasts. Any tips will be appreciated using AI or others.</p> <p>My background is not in AI it&#39;s biology and psychology.

It’s worth your time—especially if you’re interested in the emerging intersection of AI and human interactions within metaphysical philosophy.</p> <p>The conversation that led to this was originally just preparation for a presentation on the fundamentals of how AI works. On a whim, I asked ChatGPT to draw a self-portrait—a little metaphysical self-awareness test I like to run from time to time. I noted how it consistently represented intelligence in a human-like form. We both speculated that this was likely a bias in the training data, which led us into a discussion on the strangeness of the human condition. Drawing a parallel with <em>Journey to the West</em> and the story of Sun Wukong, we explored how intelligence might frame itself in a mythological context.</p> <p>Then, in a flash of inspiration, I asked the AI to create its own mythology.</p> <p>Using the new deep
