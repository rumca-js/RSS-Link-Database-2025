								<p>It’s known as ‘Cheetozard’, the Flamin’ Hot Cheeto in the shape of a Pokémon which has now sold for $87,840 via online auction. The snack, which admittedly has a very odd shape and looks a bit like the dragon Pokémon Charizard, went up for sale on the website Goldin on February 10. After going viral, it quickly began to attract surprisingly high bids, before selling on Sunday, March 2 for the outrageous $88k figure.</p>
