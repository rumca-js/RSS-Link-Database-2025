<p>Alfonso Quixote, a descendant of Cervantes’ idealistic hero, is on a mission to save his town in this unsatisfying animated adventure</p><p>Films of Don Quixote have a notoriously rough time of it. Orson Welles ran out of money making his doomed adaptation. Terry Gilliam’s first stab was such a catastrophe it went down as one of the unluckiest films in screen history.

The makers of this family animation dodge the age-inappropriate issue with a central character who is Don Quixote’s modern-day descendant: an 11-year-old boy dreamer. Though to be fair, the film shares more DNA with other loud crashy kids’ movies than Cervantes.</p><p>Our misguided hero is Alfonso Quixote, the great-great-great-and-then-some grandson of the legendary 17th-century Don.

<p>A gripping study of the CIA smuggling operation to get banned books behind the iron curtain</p><p>In March 1984 Polish customs officers noticed a suspicious truck. It had arrived on an overnight ferry from Copenhagen, docking at the Baltic port of Świnoujście. The truck’s interior was smaller than its exterior. Workmen broke through a walled-off inside panel. To their surprise, they found a cache of books – 800 of them – and illicit printing presses. And forbidden walkie-talkies. “Oh shit! Reactionary propaganda!” the officer exclaimed.</p><p>The shipment was to be delivered to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/sep/18/the-birth-of-solidarity-in-poland-archive-1980">Polish opposition movement Solidarity</a>.

<p>What Ruben Amrorim should do now, Danny Welbeck and an unlikely England call, and why Michal Oliver was right</p><p>“Pick the kids!” is a frequent cry when a team are playing poorly, and generally speaking it’s an incorrect one: the last thing a young player needs is to be hurled into a mess of the sort Manchester United are in. But sometimes it works – Mikel Arteta, for example, struggling at Arsenal, eventually promoted Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe because he had no other choice, and hasn’t looked back since. Now Ruben Amorim must make a similar call. A lack of alternatives forced him to persevere with Rasmus Højlund, but over the past week Chido Obi-Martin has earned a chance, contributing at Everton before asserting properly against Fulham, on both occasions more dangerous than Højlund, in less time. And, given United’s league season is over – and, given also, their lack of pace in defence – it might be worth seeing what Ayden Heaven can do, seeking to inject momentum and

<p>A new show of visceral, violent and anxiety-strewn drawings reveals a history of expressionist artists seeking to make the world a better place</p><p>German expressionism has rarely gone out of fashion since its emergence in the early years of the 20th century, but something about it feels particularly of the moment today. Perhaps that’s not so surprising for a movement that sought to define, graphically represent and challenge a time fraught with the threat of war, economic uncertainty and cultural conflict that often shaded into misogyny.</p><p>A large exhibition of work by the Blue Rider group occupied Tate Modern in London for much of last year and is now followed by a more focused show at the Courtauld Gallery. With Graphic Intent seeks to examine expressionism’s engagement with some of these heightened themes through one characteristic aspect of activity. “Their work on paper was central to the project,” says Niccola Shearman who, along with co-curator Emily Christensen, has

## Is it true that … doing pilates can lengthen your muscles?

<p>Is the goal of a ‘long and lean’ physique promised by influencers attainable? Or does long and lean essentially just mean lean?</p><p>Pilates has been hailed as something of a wonder exercise in recent years. Some fans claim the low-impact conditioning workouts can lengthen muscles, leaving participants with longer, leaner physiques. But is that true?</p><p>Absolutely not, says Dr Christopher Morse, reader in exercise physiology at Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport. For a start, he says, there’s little evidence to show human muscle fibres can be lengthened by stretching – and if it were possible, it would require putting the muscle under great strain, which pilates doesn’t do. “There is <a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/1994/08000/muscle_fiber_splitting_in_stretch_enlarged_avian.7.aspx">some data</a> that shows you can lengthen muscles,” he says, “but it was performed on the wings of quails with a weight hanging off them for 16 days of contin

<p>The celebrated Black American author’s arrival in the City of Light is reimagined in this freewheeling feature, which prioritises images over the spoken word</p><p>There’s a woozy and seductive quality to Yashaddai Owens’s impressionistic narrative debut. Shot in evocative black and white on textured 16mm stock, this almost dialogue-free feature evokes the freewheeling spirit of 1920s city symphony films. The propulsive opening alights at Istanbul, a metropolis gradually rousing from slumber. First lingering on wandering stray dogs and cats, Jimmy soon shifts gear into a more energetic mode; animated by the rhythm of urban life, the camera swirls around the bustling city, taking in its beautiful people and architecture. Enveloping these images is Paco Andreo’s chameleonic score, which accompanies almost the entire length of the film. Though at times punctuated by diegetic on-location sounds, the shape-shifting music responds to the ebb and flow of the montage, adding a sensorial t

Two voices carry through the still of the dusk, over the shrieking seagulls and the roar of the surf. “ZOMBIE, ZOMBIE, ZOMBIE-BIE-BIE,” the voices chime. Fifty yards down the beach, William O’Connor smiles and waves. Most streets, most weeks, the world’s 49th-best darts player could take an evening stroll in total anonymity. But not this street. Not this week.</p><p>Inside the vast Skyline Pavilion, with 4,000 empty seats for company, Luke Humphries is throwing practice darts. Most of his rivals are taking a well-earned break between the afternoon and evening sessions, but Humphries likes to case the joint.
