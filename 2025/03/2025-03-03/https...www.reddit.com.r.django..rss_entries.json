The client has a local server that they use for backups and store some information on site. I was thinking about moving the two workers and the redis instance to the NAS and connect them to the main server and the db.</p> <p>From a cybersecurity perspective, I know it would be better to keep everything on Render, but the workers handle non-essential tasks and non-confidential information; so my take is that this could be done without severely compromising information for the client and reducing the montly costs on Render. I would obviously configure the NAS and the db so they only accept connections from one another and the NAS has decent cybersecurity protocols according to the client.</p> <p>Am I missing something? Does anyone have any other suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
