<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I spent an entire year searching for books and information on iPhone hacking. Everything I bought was useless—until today, when a friend told me about a book by someone named AliPunisher3, titled &quot;Exploring Security Risks and Protections in iOS.&quot; I bought it from Leanpub, read it, and I can confidently say it’s the most powerful and best book on iPhone hacking. If anyone knows of a similar book, please let me know. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AardvarkOutrageous76"> /u/AardvarkOutrageous76 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1j2ss20/just_found_the_great_book_about_iphone_hacking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1j2ss20/just_found_the_great_book_about_iphone_hacking/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I’m participating in a bug bounty where the goal is to clone a browser extension (I’ll call it &quot;ShadowExt&quot; for anonymity) and modify it to work with my own information, as part of a challenge to help the developers strengthen security against cloning. They are aware of my investigation, and the focus is on replicating functionality, not exploiting vulnerabilities. I’m learning a lot along the way, but I’m stuck at a step and would love some help from the community!</p> <h1>What I’ve Done So Far:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Local Environment Setup</strong>: I’ve downloaded the Docker image of the extension’s API (shadow-api:latest) and set it up locally. I’m running the API in a container on port 3000, with a PostgreSQL (port 5432) and a Redis (port 6379) connected via a custom Docker network.</li> <li><strong>Environment Variables</strong>: I’ve identified and configured critical variables, such as a JWT secret for authenti
