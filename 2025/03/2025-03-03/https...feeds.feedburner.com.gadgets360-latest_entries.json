        "description": "A new study has analysed ancient DNA from 370 individuals buried between the fourth and sixth centuries, revealing that the European Huns were genetically diverse. While some showed direct ties to Xiongnu elites from Mongolia, most carried mixed Northeast Asian ancestry. Researchers found no evidence of a single large-scale migration but instead observed long-term intermixing. The findings indicate that the Huns were not a homogenous group but rather a population formed through centuries of movement, alliances, and cultural blending.",

The rover\u2019s scans revealed sloping sand layers similar to those found on Earth\u2019s beaches, reinforcing theories of long-term water presence. Experts highlight that these formations are not volcanic or impact-related, strengthening the argument for Mars' past habitability. The discovery adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the Red Planet once had conditions suitable for sustaining life.",
