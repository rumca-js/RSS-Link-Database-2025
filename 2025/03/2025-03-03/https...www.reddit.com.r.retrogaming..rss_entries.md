<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&#39;m looking for an old strategy game with pixel-art graphics. The game includes a population mechanic, where male and female workers enter a hut to have children, thereby expanding your tribe. There are also elements of farming, like planting carrots and chopping wood, as well as building ships. The graphics were quite rough, and the camera had an overhead (top-down) perspective.</p> <p>Additionally, I remember an opening cinematic where the camera moves through a forest and shows a skeleton with a sword stuck in it. The camera then enters a puddle, revealing the game&#39;s title before heading into the main menu. The game&#39;s icon was a golden sun with an angry or serious face.</p> <p>Other details:</p> <ol> <li>The game is similar to Age of Empires in terms of strategy.</li> <li>Regarding the children mechanic, you can&#39;t create slaves—only workers. You place a male and a female worker in a house, and a child is born who grows up to become

You would click and drag from your missile launcher to the other window where you wanted to shoot at. I remember it being really enjoybale but not much more info I&#39;m afraid.
