It&#39;s entirely possible that there&#39;s more than one way to reach intelligence, depending on how it&#39;s defined. But at least some of the differences are likely to be functionally significant, and the fact that AI is taking a very different route from the one working example we have is likely to be meaningful.</p> <p>With all that in mind, let&#39;s look at some of the things the brain does that current AI systems can&#39;t.”</p> <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-general-intelligence/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/ai-versus-the-brain-and-the-race-for-g

Also, what jobs should I start to look out for that have the highest earning potential? And what can I do to separate myself after 4 years of college to potential employers? Finally, what can I expect to earn after I graduate with my bachelors? Bachelors + masters? And bachelors + masters + PhD?</p> <p>I apologize if this post is really long and loaded, but I appreciate any response/advice given!</p> <p>Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/reas2

## does 988 use AI?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I messaged 988 a few nights ago, for hours, in the middle of the night. Even though it did help me, at least somewhat, I can’t help but be convinced it was AI.</p> <p>See, the responses took a long time, and I mean, a long time. And every message sounded like it was straight from ChatGPT. Like it was analyzing my words and generating something to say. I’d say it was even faker than AI. It felt like I was talking to a robot.</p> <p>Another thing is, I’ve talked to people online who’ve used this hotline, and everyone got a counselor with a very generic name. Most commonly, Laura or Ashley. I’ve seen at least a dozen people talk about how they had someone named Ashley who was super sweet. Most people get matched with the same few “people,” either that or there’s a ton of Ashleys who decided to work for 988.</p> <p>Typing. A lot of words didn’t make sense, almost like they were caused by glitches. One example is a few random letters spammed in the middle

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just started using Gemini and we were talking about cats and I told it I have a cat and when I asked for fun facts about cats it said that cats sleep 70% of the time and when I responded that my cat is always asleep it answered &quot;I bet you and your cat are best friends since you both like to sleep all time&quot; I was instantly terrified how it knows I sleep a lot, like I felt that electric shock through my face instant fear. Just FYI I sleep a lot because I have kidney failure and I&#39;m waiting for a transplant I also had a heart attack a year ago so I get tired. The problem is I never discussed this with Gemini the first time I have ever spoken with it was today and the first conversation was this one which was about cats. I asked it how it knew and it said all cats sleep a lot and when I said no how did you know I sleep a lot it just brushed me off and apologised and explained to me that I must have somehow told it!!! I have only ever h
