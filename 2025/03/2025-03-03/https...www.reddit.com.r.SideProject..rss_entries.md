<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Arise is a gamified self-improvement app that helps users build better habits through XP, streak tracking, and real consequences for failure. Users complete daily tasks related to fitness, discipline, mental growth, and productivity to earn XP and level up in real life. The app includes a streak tracking system to encourage consistency, leaderboards for competition, and a punishment system that enforces accountability. If a user fails to complete tasks, they lose XP, break their streak, or face self-set consequences such as financial penalties or social accountability measures. The goal is to make personal growth as addictive as a video game while ensuring real-world results.</p> <p>I’m currently in the MVP stage, refining the core concept and exploring development options. My focus this month is validating the idea, gathering feedback, and deciding whether to build in Adalo for speed or invest in a custom-coded platform for long-term scalability. I’

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>I wanted to share my journey of building a side project while working full-time as a software developer. It’s been a long road—over 1.5 years! During this time, a lot happened in my personal life: my daughter was born, before that I traveled a lot, and I definitely didn’t work on this every day. But I never gave up!</p> <p>It all started because I wanted to automate some tasks. I often wrote scripts to track changes in things like flight prices, hotel availability, or product deals—especially when planning holidays. I tried some existing tools, but they were either unreliable or way too expensive. So, I decided to build my own solution.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges? Websites are built in so many different ways. Making sure my app could monitor as many sites as possible took a lot of time and effort. But I kept going, improving it bit by bit.</p> <p>Now, after all this time, I finally have a working service! It feels amazi

It’s an early access tool that digs into how weather vibes might tie into our moods, mixing some science with a pinch of spiritual flair. Nothing too heavy, just a playful experiment to poke at. It&#39;s currently just a proof of concept so not all aspects of the tool are functional just yet, it needs some more development to enhance and expand the app further.</p> <p>To build out the idea, I worked with an AI agent for the web development and using Open-Meteo and/or WeatherAPI for weather data and some basic sentiment analysis to track mood shifts from social media posts. </p> <p>Built it mostly to see if rain really makes us grumpier or if sunshine lifts the spirit. </p> <p>Check it out at <a href="http://timacedigital.com/people-weather">timacedigital.com/people-weather</a> if you’re curious!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Hey fellow builders,</strong></p> <p>A while ago, I tested interest for a tool called <strong>EasyMilestone</strong>—a simple way for freelancers and agencies to manage milestone payments (e.g., 20% upfront, 20% after completing Milestone 1, 20% after completing Milestone 2, 30% on completion). 20+ people signed up back then, but I never built it. Now I’m revisiting the idea and need honest feedback before writing any code.</p> <ul> <li>If you work with milestone payments, how do you currently handle it?</li> <li>What’s the biggest pain point—chasing payments, tracking milestones, or something else?</li> <li>Would you even use a tool like this, or is it just another unnecessary SaaS?</li> </ul> <p>I know <strong>not every idea needs to be built</strong>, so I’d rather validate before diving in. Appreciate any insights!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jorritba"> /u/jorritba </a> <br/> <spa

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been building startup for almost 3 years. I realized one thing - <strong>founders do not have time for things that really matter</strong>. After some time in the business most founders have to manage unrelated stuff - legal, customer service, marketing. Especially in the beginning, they should focus on the product/service and push it as much as possible. Of course, it&#39;s hard but there is possibility to outsource most of that - to VAs or external experts. To help with that, I started <a href="https://knmstudio.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post">web dev &amp; design studio</a>, for busy startup founders. I am here to not only create landing page for you, but also to <strong>talk with you about potential solution</strong> (for free!!!), <strong>and point you in the right direction</strong>. I would be happy to really help some of you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jmisilo"> /u/
