Once <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/cozy-gaming/526988/two-point-museum-impressions-management-sim">Two Point Museum</a></em> is out of the way early in the week, the games either break conventions, like with <em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, or they play with familiar genres, like whatever <em>FragPunk</em> is doing as a hero shooter. Close your eyes and try to land on something normal in the list below — you can’t!</p>
