        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media blatantly lies about the meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the White House. We\u2019ll talk about what really happened and who is actually to blame. Also, there was a land acknowledgment recited on the Oscars red carpet last night as the Left continues to transcend parody. The mayor of Boston mourns the loss of a guy who tried to stab random pedestrians to death. And The Wall Street Journal publishes an op-ed telling white men to shut up and stop complaining.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:24 Opening\n01:50 - 23:00 Trump Puts International Welfare Queen Zelensky In His Place \n24:08 - 28:40 Julianne Hough Gives Land Acknowledgement At The Oscars\n28:41 - 34:05 Boston Mayor Offers Condolences For City Stabber Who Was Killed\n34:06 - 43:40 Ilhan Omar Calls Elon Musk One Of The Dumbest People On Earth\n44:47 - 50:05 The Comments Section\n50:38 - 1:06:18 The Author Of This Racist Op-Ed Is Canceled\n\nEp.1547\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06tvV9zROps\n",
