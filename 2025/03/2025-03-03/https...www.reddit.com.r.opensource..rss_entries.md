<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For most ordinary business and administrative CRUD apps, end users usually want desktop-like GUI&#39;s. Most &quot;productivity&quot; users still use mice and PC&#39;s and/or laptops. &quot;Mobile first&quot; orientation was a mistake for biz CRUD, it wants desktop-first.</p> <p>Using wrappers (libraries) to re-project HTML/DOM into a desktop-like GUI takes rocket surgery. No framework does it well without a long learning curve. While libraries like React can create decent GUI&#39;s, the learning curve is giant because there are piles of gotcha&#39;s to trip up learners. It may be good job security for React dev&#39;s, but it costs business and the economy way too much. It&#39;s not economically logical.</p> <p>Thus, we need a new state-ful GUI-over-http standard such that GUI&#39;s don&#39;t have to be reinvented so often (and poorly) in JavaScript. I doubt DOM can be retrofitted without breaking backward compatibility.</p> <p>The failure of Java Ap
