“I don’t check anybody’s citizenship status… I don’t mess with that.”

Project Veritas went undercover in Liberty County, Texas, to investigate Terrenos Houston, the real estate group driving the rapid expansion of Colony Ridge, and uncovered how it’s aggressively marketing the American dream of homeownership to illegal immigrants and foreign investors, including Chinese buyers, right in the heart of Texas.
