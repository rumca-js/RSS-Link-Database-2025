<p dir="ltr">I don't know why, but I tend to gravitate toward sad stories in virtually all forms of media. My favorite shows are The Leftovers and Six Feet Under. My favorite book is Station Eleven. Some of my favorite songs are especially dour, like Circa Survive's Spirit of the Stairwell. My favorite games often exhibit this preference, too, with games like Rime, Spiritfarer, and Before Your Eyes representing some of my all-time favorites. It's been this way for me for as long as I can remember. I can't explain it, but I can certainly recognize it. For this reason, I'm very excited for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/herdling/">Herdling</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Swiss studio at Okomotive previously made indie darlings Far: Lone Sails and its sequel, Far: Changing Tides tell a connected story about characters navigating a mysterious world on a makeshift boat.

<p>Former Capcom and Platinum Games director Hideki Kamiya has said that he wants another shot at creating Scalebound, the canceled Xbox game.</p><p>Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, released a video of Kamiya reminiscing about Scalebound while his staff surrounds him. Kamiya talks to his developers about the Scalebound's shooting mechanics and the fact that the main protagonist, Drew, wears headphones and has a smartphone in a world filled with dragons. Kamiya then comments on how Scalebound is like an isekai, a popular genre where a the protagonist from the real world gets transported into a fantasy setting, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forspoken/">Forspoken</a>.</p><p>While Clovers' Twitter post about the video ends with Kamiya saying he'd love to make it again, the actual video doesn't show it. However, Kamiya confirmed his sentiments by retweeting the post and referring to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, saying, "Let's do it, Phil!"</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/artic

<p>DreamWorks recently showed off a first look at Shrek 5, and among the many reactions from fans was commentary about how the art style for Shrek and his family was not quite hitting the eye right.

<p dir="ltr">Games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 don't get made anymore. And that's because games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <em>can't</em> be made anymore. French developer Sandfall Interactive's influences were obvious to me from the moment I began playing the game, and confirmed when director Guillaume Broche and producer François Meurisse effusively recounted the joys of playing Final Fantasy, Persona, Zelda, and many other Japanese titles.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, Expedition 33 looks to be moving in the right direction; drawing from its clear inspirations while also adding interesting twists and new takes. But many other games have done this--in this respect, Expedition 33 isn't notably unique or rare. What does, however, differentiate this game from its contemporaries is how it evokes the vibe of a transitional period of time when JRPGs and its flag bearers struggled to find their place on a new generation of consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">While Sandfall Intera

<p>John Cena's heel turn at Elimination Chamber 2025 will go down in history as one of the most shocking TV moments of all time, and with a reference to a long-running <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">GTA 6</a> meme on his social media, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsPKjOOB5k">WWE superstar is clearly aware of it</a>. In case you missed it, Cena took part in the main event of Elimination Chamber on Saturday, and after emerging victorious, he ended the night by turning heel on Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes and aligning with The Rock. While wrestlers turning to the dark side is a common part of the wrestling business, Cena's transition is one that has been joked about in the same breath as a GTA 6 release date for over a decade now.</p><div data-embed-type="html" data-social-type="instagram" data-has-image="true"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https:/
