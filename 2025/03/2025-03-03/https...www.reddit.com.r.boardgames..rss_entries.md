During Black Friday, most of my LGSs had sales, and I and saw lots of deals online. But all stores were out of stock for most of the games on my wish list, so I only managed to pick up two games from my LGS.</p> <p>I see that stores now have many of my wish list games back in stock, so I&#39;m ready to put in a big order! But I want to check first if there might be any good sales coming up before I go ahead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImYarnBall"> /u/ImYarnBall </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j2wxp5/canadians_any_sales_other_than_during_the_holiday/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j2wxp5/canadians_any_sales_other_than_during_the_holiday/">[comments]</a></span>

I have looked at BGG forum and I understand the catch up mechanic is there (refresh power up and map matters). But I watched some play through and in those videos, the last player stays last.</p> <p>Skill issue is definitely part of the formula. It’s useless if you don’t know to use those catch up mechanic strategically. So can anyone share past experience with the game where last player of the game eventually catch up to the leader? </p> <p>I never played a racing game (except El Dorado with a bad experience) so I don’t have much experience, but I guess that is an inherently element in racing game and it’s impossible to remove it completely. Is there a racing game where everyone can potentially at all time? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard_Package_397"> /u/Standard_Package_397 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red

## Nuts about Mutts fleas question

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My family is having a heated debate about a specific situation that occurred while playing Nuts about Mutts. </p> <p>On my turn I played the fleas card. The player to my right and left both drew a card. The player on my right happened to draw another fleas card and then immediately played it to counter the fleas. </p> <p>I questioned that play and referred to the rulebook which states, “Force the player directly on your left and right to draw a card or play a Fleas card of their own. For each player that is able to play a Fleas card, you must draw 1 card instead. You may not play a second fleas card to counter their response.”</p> <p>Based on the wording of the Fleas rule it’s my understanding that you cannot play a fleas card to counter if you drew the card because a different player played a fleas card on their turn. </p> <p>I texted grandpa Beck and this is the response I received, “Fleas can only be played on your turn.” Which further backs up my

## Twilight Struggle or Terraforming Mars

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been playing board games for a while but I only really got into the hobby over the past year. A friend of mine offered to sell me Twilight Struggle and Terraforming Mars at $20 each. I’m not really sure which one to get (not going to get both, already have too many games), so I was hoping for some advice. Twilight struggle sounds cool, but I don’t really have anyone specific who I think would be willing to sit down and play with me more than once or twice. Terraforming Mars seems pretty cool, but I haven’t really played anything like it and from what I hear the Prelude expansion is mandatory. I’m not really sure if that’s something I want to get into right away. Any advice would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/galcticcat"> /u/galcticcat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j2b7yv/twilight_struggle_or_terraforming_mars/">[link]</a></span> &#3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First things first. By high end, I mean willing to spend ~$7k to $12k all in for a 6 person all wood table and chairs (84” x 48” is our ideal). We want this to be the last game table/matching chairs we ever have to buy. </p> <p>Unless folks onsite can vouch that things at Wyrmwood are no longer toxic, they are not in the running for consideration. No matter how beautiful they may be. </p> <p>Don’t want medieval distressed and don’t want mid century modern. We want to be able to pick the wood and stain. Prefer cup holders as attachments on rails, not built into the table edge. Open to drawers, fold out, or other options for individual players to organize their game components. We have a dedicated game room so this isn’t our main dining table but want the option to take a break and put a topper on for eating/snacking. </p> <p>Given the price point we’re willing to pay, looking to work with a business vs hobby woodworker (unless you have a registered bu
