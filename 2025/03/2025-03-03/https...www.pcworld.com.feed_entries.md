<p>On Monday, browser maker Opera published a seriously impressive demo of what it calls “Browser Operator,” showing off its upcoming AI-powered browser technology that allows you to assign shopping tasks to Opera, which it then pursues independently.</p>



<p>Opera calls this “agentic browsing” and claims that it’s a “paradigm shift for browsers.” The tech industry likes to overuse that phrase, with almost everything being a paradigm shift in some way, but in this case it might actually be appropriate.</p>



<p>Agentic browsing allows you to prompt the browser to research a shopping task for you, using AI, in much the same way you might check a number of shopping sites or ask a travel agent to plan a vacation for you. Opera says the browser does all of this locally, using your PC’s resources, rather than sending the information to the cloud. The shopping t

<p>It took Ikea some time for Ikea to <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2251966/ikea-matter-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get onto the Matter bandwagon</a>, and now that it’s on board, there’s growing evidence the home furnishings giant is about to wade deeper into the Matter standard. </p>

<p>Matt Smith called the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED a “budget laptop star” <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2289137/asus-zenbook-14-oled-review-3.html">when he reviewed it last year</a>, and it’s still a popular model for anyone looking for great parts at a low price.</p>



<p>Today, you can get an even better deal with Newegg (via eBay) offering a refurbished model with a touchscreen, Ryzen 7 processor, and 16GB of RAM <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296975409289">for just $609.99</a>. That’s over $350 off the current price on Newegg, which is already fairly low for a premium design.</p>



<p>And despite being refurbished, this one comes with a 2-year Allstate warranty. That’s double the term of the usual manufacturer warranty… though results for actually making a claim appear to be mixed. Even so, it’s a lot better than the 90 days you usually get. </

<p>Windows 11 users can now use the JPEG XL image extension. All you need to do is download <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mzprth5c0tb">JPEG XL Image Extension from the Microsoft Store</a>, which will enable the OS to view and save images in the new format.</p>



<p>In order to be eligible for using the JPEG XL image extension, you’ll need to be on Windows 11 24H2. Once you’re on 24H2 and after you’ve downloaded and installed the extension, you can start viewing and saving image files with the <code>.jxl</code> extension in apps.</p>



<p>With the extension installed, existing JPEG files can also be converted to the lossless JPEG XL format, significantly reducing the file size without harming its quality. Conversely, JPEG XL files can easily be converted back to the original JPEG format as needed.</p>

The problem could be <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2617610/some-rtx-50-series-gpus-are-missing-rop-hardware-nvidia-confirms.html">missing ROP hardware</a>, and now CPU-Z can narrow it down for you with its latest update.</p>



<p>To be more specific, CPU-Z could always give you a precise count of Render Output Units (ROP), but now it’ll show a bright purple warning on its web-based validation page if the number of ROPs in your physical card doesn’t match the proper number according to its specifications.</p>

## Microsoft’s Copilot AI will no longer help you pirate Windows 11

<p>Apparently, Microsoft’s AI assistant Copilot may have been a little too helpful in some cases. Last week, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/want-to-activate-windows-11-for-free-just-ask-microsoft-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neowin reported</a> that Copilot was showing users how to activate pirated copies of Windows 11 using third-party scripts. Yikes.</p>



<p>Microsoft obviously didn’t like its AI assistant supporting piracy, and <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-silences-copilot-so-it-can-no-longer-help-you-pirate-windows-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neowin recently wrote</a> that the company has updated Copilot to no longer be as helpful when it comes to activating pirated software.</p>

<p>A common problem you may encounter with your DisplayPort, which connects the monitor to a graphics card, is called <strong>Link Failure</strong>. This is when that connection fails. It mainly happens with AMD graphics cards, especially when the system wakes up from sleep mode. You can recognize the link failure by the fact that the screen suddenly switches to a lower resolution.</p>



<p>When this happens, the Radeon software will display an error message that disappears in a flash. In this case, open the software and look for the message that the monitor does not support the selected resolution or refresh rate. If the problem occurs after changing the screen resolution or refresh rate, it’s probably because the monitor cannot process the new settings.</p>



<p>Simply reset the settings to resolve the problem. However, if these link errors occur randomly
