<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve deployed an e-commerce website&#39;s backend (made with django) on vercel (basically it uses DRF APIs, which are accessed by my react frontend) with postgres database on supabase </p> <p>It got deployed successfully and all APIs are working fine (although the loading time is slow; any suggestions would be appreciated) </p> <p>BUT THERE ARE 2 ROUTES (wss://) which are created using django channels&#39; websockets<br/> THESE TWO ROUTES AREN&#39;T WORKING, I&#39;M GETTING NOT FOUND LOG </p> <p>Later, i came to know vercel doesn&#39;t support websockets, so I NEED SOME GUIDANCE OR TUTORIALS for deploying them separately using pusher and integrating it with my vercel app </p> <p>Also i found pricing for deploying these are costly, so not just the pusher method any method which resolves my issue (i.e working of websockets) would be appreciable </p> <p>IS THERE ANY WAY TO CONFIGURE IT DIRECTLY USING VERCEL ITSELF?? OR ELSE THE FREE OR CHEAPEST THIR

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Our client is currently using Render as a hosting service for the Django web app, 2 worker instances, one db instance and one redis instance. The client has a local server that they use for backups and store some information on site. I was thinking about moving the two workers and the redis instance to the NAS and connect them to the main server and the db.</p> <p>From a cybersecurity perspective, I know it would be better to keep everything on Render, but the workers handle non-essential tasks and non-confidential information; so my take is that this could be done without severely compromising information for the client and reducing the montly costs on Render. I would obviously configure the NAS and the db so they only accept connections from one another and the NAS has decent cybersecurity protocols according to the client.</p> <p>Am I missing something? Does anyone have any other suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr
