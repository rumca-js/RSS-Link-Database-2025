<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Better performance through proton than natively on windows (Full AMD, idk about others). In my opinion getting the HTPC version is worth it, not because of steam deck mode, but the UI looks best. Look at the screenshots on the download page and pick the one that looks best to you. Using any of the KDE versions is recommended because of KDE connect, which is like windows phone link on steroids. KDE version very easy to use, especially if switching from windows 10. 10/10 definitely keeping this on my main pc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DcoolPlayzYT"> /u/DcoolPlayzYT </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://nobaraproject.org/download-nobara/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j2vzqn/extremely_short_nobara_review/">[comments]</a></span>
