<p>You knew that Nvidia’s newest graphics cards wouldn’t be cheap, even if you could find one to buy. But between scalpers and tariffs, finding one at anything resembling Nvidia’s suggested retail price is all but impossible. MSI is doing its part to make sure it stays that way with an across-the-board price increase.</p>



<p><a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/msi-unlaunches-its-msrp-cards-rtx-50-series-get-a-price-hike-in-official-store">VideoCardz.com noticed</a> that MSI raised the price on its OEM version of the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Graphics-Cards/NVIDIA-GPU/GeForce-RTX-50-Series/GeForce-RTX-5070-Ti-16G-SHADOW-3X?sort=p.price&order=ASC">“base” RTX 5070 Ti Shadow 3X</a>, from $750 at launch to $819.99 now. That $70 bump means there isn’t a single card in MSI’s US store showing the base price that Nvidia promoted at the CES 2025 announcemen

## Lenovo gets weird with double, triple-screen laptop concepts at MWC

<p>There are only so many ways to make a laptop, right? Screen on one half, keyboard on the other, hinge in the middle. That’s the way it’s been going for decades, save for the occasional experiment.</p>



<p>But Lenovo likes to mix things up, and at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, it’s doing just that with super-tall screens, double screens, triple screens… They’re all on display, but most won’t make it to market.</p>



<p>The ThinkBook “Codename Flip” <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/advancing-ai-powered-business-computing-thinkpad-thinkbook-concept-devices/">highlights the company’s portfolio</a>. It looks a little goofy in still images, but think of it as a fusion between a folding phone and a laptop and you’re pretty much there. The super-tall, 18.1-inch OLED touchscreen display is essentially two screens stacked on to

<p>There is something mysterious about Windows services: Most users have heard of them, many have even looked at the list of services in Computer Management.</p>



<p>But hardly anyone knows what the services are all about or dares to start, stop, or delete individual services. And that’s a good thing. Because the services are one of the basic building blocks of Windows. Without them, numerous functions of the operating system won’t work. </p>



<p>Let’s dig into how Windows services can be useful, how to create your own services, and how to delete unimportant services.</p>

## What happened to DirectStorage? Why don’t more PC games use it?

<p>Ah, DirectStorage. Remember how exciting it was when Microsoft announced — <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/623036/microsoft-releases-directstorage-the-future-of-fast-loading-pc-games.html">just three years ago!</a> — that it was bringing its fast asset-loading tech from Xbox to PC? We thought <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1486755/microsoft-directstorage-tested-nvme-vs-sata-ssds.html">loading screens would be a thing of the past</a> and that corridor/elevator loading segments in games would all but disappear with them.</p>



<p>Now, cut to 2025. Only a handful of games use DirectStorage and none of them are groundbreaking in its effect. What happened?</p>



<p>Well, DirectStorage still exists. It’s still out there and developers can make more use of it if they choose to. But there are a number of reasons why that’s not happening. Let’s
