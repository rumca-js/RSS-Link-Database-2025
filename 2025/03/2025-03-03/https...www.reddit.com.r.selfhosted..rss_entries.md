The issue with those is that they authenticate with steam servers, which uses the public IP of the server for listing in the game. So even though you join via the VPS&#39;s public IP the server status displays my home&#39;s IP address.</p> <p>I&#39;ve set up a reverse proxy with wireguard and FRP (fast reverse proxy) before, but neither setup was ideal.<br/> FRP allows for joining the game servers just fine, the configuration is super easy even for a newbie like me, but I dont know if you can mask the IP how I want it to. It works great for websites and minecraft.</p> <p>Wireguard fixed that masking issue, but it also meant that the entire server had the ip address of my VPS (at least the way i had set it up), which interfered with some other services i wanted to install on that server.</p> <p>To recap, I need to mask
