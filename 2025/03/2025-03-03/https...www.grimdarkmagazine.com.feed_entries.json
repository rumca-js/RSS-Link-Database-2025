        "description": "<p>Launching the Twisting Loyalties story arc, Conan the Barbarian #17 depicts Conan adventuring alongside the pirate queen B\u00ealit. Having served at her side for close to a year under the assumed name of Amra the Lion, Conan joins B\u00ealit and the crew of their vessel The Tigress for some rest and relaxation in the port town of Kyros. Conan and his beautiful captain settle in for a night of passion at a posh inn called the Hidden Haven, but reckless bandits hoping for an easy score literally drop in on the pair. In the original source material, Conan\u2019s time at sea with B\u00ealit is related in Robert E. Howard\u2019s 1934 story \u201cQueen of the Black Coast.\u201d While that story begins with the barbarian throwing in his lot with the crew of The Tigress and concludes with B\u00ealit\u2019s tragic death, the largely unchronicled gaps in the narrative have been fertile ground for subsequent creators. \u201cConan the Pirate\u201d is a premise that immediately appeals, and B\u00ealit is one of the strongest female characters in Howar",
