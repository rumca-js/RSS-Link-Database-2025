<p>Before a new car comes to market, it&#39;s subjected to many months, sometimes years, of rigorous testing around the world. Sweden often hosts a big part of that journey, its cold northern expanses offering the perfect mix of frigid temperatures and frozen surfaces.</p>
<p>It&#39;s there that I myself got to do a little testing of an upcoming new EV from Mercedes-Benz. It&#39;s the GLC with EQ Technology, an all-electric version of one of the company&#39;s most popular SUVs. With new batteries, new motors and a higher-voltage charging system, it marks a significant departure from, and upgrade over, the company&#39;s current EV offerings like the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqe-suv-first-drive-big-luxury-in-a-smaller-suv-220134605.html"><ins>EQE SUV</ins></a>.</p>

Company CEO Tim Cook <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1896589954517701057"><ins>took to social media</ins></a> to post a tease-heavy video, along with the caption “this week.”</p>
<p>The video itself plays music as the text “there’s something in the air” crawls along the screen. Finally, a tell-tale ultra-thin swoosh interrupts the text. It’s incredibly likely that the swoosh is being used to represent the forthcoming M4 MacBook Air. We don’t know when this week the announcement will take place, so hold tight.</p>

The tool takes advantage of Gemini&#39;s multi-modal capabilities to allow users to show the chatbot what their phone&#39;s camera sees. As you can see from the demo Google shared, Gemini is able to answer a question about mid-century modern decor and offer a suggestion when it comes how to apply that knowledge to pottery.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">wireless earbuds</a> to become <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">ubiquitous</a>. Apple’s AirPods launched back in September 2016, joining notable true wireless headphones from Jabra, Sony, Samsung, and others. Shortly after, they became the go-to choice for many of us when listening to music, podcasts and streaming services on our phones and tablets.</p> 
<p>But wireless earbuds can get very dirty very quickly, because not only are we using them a lot, but we take them everywhere: to work, on public transport, on flights and everywhere in between.
