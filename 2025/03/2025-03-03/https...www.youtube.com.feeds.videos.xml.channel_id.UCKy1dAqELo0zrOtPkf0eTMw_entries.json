        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nWe still haven't seen a new trailer for GTA 6, but Rockstar is expanding its portfolio of studios. Rockstar recently acquired Video Games Deluxe, who worked on the re-release of L.A. Noire and its VR spinoff, and helped fix Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy\u2014The Definitive Edition after its underwhelming launch. No word yet on how this impacts GTA 6, if at all. In other news, blurry screenshots have emerged from a canceled Twisted Metal project. The game was apparently an online title that had traditional vehicular combat mixed with battle royale and on-foot elements. And finally, Monster Hunter Wilds' cheese naan cutscene is sending players on an IRL foodie hunt for actual cheese naan. In fact, an Indian restaurant in Tokyo actually ran out of cheese trying to fill all the orders.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #GTA6",
