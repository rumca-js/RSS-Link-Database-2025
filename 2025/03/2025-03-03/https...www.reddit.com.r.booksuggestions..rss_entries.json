I also could not enjoy the landscape/faerie descriptions more. And the Emily/Wendell dynamic (and Shadow and Orga\u2019s) is delightful. </p> <p>Any suggestions? In terms of other fantasy I\u2019ve enjoyed, I\u2019m a huge LOTR nerd. I also loved the Chronicle of Narnia books as a kid. I get that these are not similar to the Emily Wilde or History of Dragons series but hoping this is helpful context. Favorite authors are probably Dostoevsky, DFW, Atwood, and Kundera (in that order), if that helps. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC",

I could go on google and ask \u201cbest philosophy, best books of all time\u201d or something like that, but I want to hear read from real people and why the book is important to you.

I like everything about the story and it is even very regrettable that it is so short but on the other hand it adds to the striking and frustrating side of the ending. I can&#39;t find anyone who has read or enjoyed this book as much as I do. If you have read it, come forward and tell me what you liked about this book, I would very much like to know everyone&#39;s perception and opinion. Also recommend similar books to me, I am literally in despair, I WANT to rediscover this atmosphere and this kind of relationship that I read a year ago. If you haven&#39;t read it yet, read it lol.

She\u2019s a reader and claims she is having a tough time finding books on this niche interest. She has been spending a lot of time in Montana and visited the Crazy Horse memorial, working and learning while there. I told her I\u2019d ask the people of Reddit to see if any of you knew of any books!</p> <p>She wants a modern perspective, if possible.
