## WARNING: Switching the Wine runtime to GE-Proton will RESET your game progress!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I upgraded to Heroic Launcher version 2.16 (Linux version, via Flatpak) and I tested the new GE-Proton runtime version 8-32 with a couple of games that were already installed (switching the runtime on the Settings/Wine Version tab), and in both cases the game progress was reset as if it was a fresh install (no savegames present, apparently). </p> <p>Interestingly, when I switched back to the trusty old Wine-GE 8-26 the savegames were accessible and the game progress was intact. </p> <p>This I noticed after restoring the savegame of one game from a backup, in a frenzy. The second one was okay (no backup-restore needed) after switching back the Wine runtime. Big sigh of relief. So the bug does not delete the savegames, fortunately.</p> <p>This seems to be some kind of bug in the migration process of the runtime, when switching it out from another Wine version.</p> <p>Please, keep this in mind, and if anyone would be so kind to submit this Issue to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been getting into Linux lately, testing Ubuntu and ZorinOS on VMs. ZorinOS feels more user-friendly, which I like. I want to use Linux for gaming, but I also do a bit of coding, video editing and the regular daily use. I heard Nobara is the “best gaming distro,” but I’m confused—what’s the big difference? Although it looks nice. On ZorinOS, Steam runs fine with Proton/Wine, and most apps I need either work natively or through emulation. </p> <p>My questions are: 1. What’s the best distro for me (gaming + coding + editing + daily use)?<br/> 2. Can I just install the official Nvidia app, or do I need third-party ones?<br/> 3. Does <em>Marvel Rivals</em> work well on Linux?<br/> 4. Should I switch to Linux or stick with Windows 11? I have two 1TB NVMe drives, so I could dual-boot. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaky_Lettuce1193"> /u/Flaky_Lettuce1193 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red

How long does it usually take for newer games to work on linux?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>It&#39;s been a week since I made a switch to Linux and so far I&#39;ve had minor issues (mostly due to old SSD&#39;s/HDD&#39;s being tied to Windows file systems, minor bugs etc.)</p> <p>But I have encountered an issue with playing for now at least one game (Space Marine 2) where when I&#39;m playing, after one hour or so there is a lot of stuttering during mouse movement.</p> <p>If running still, the game runs flawlessly - as soon as I start moving the mouse, it stutters again.</p> <p>I figure the issue is due to the polling rate. Currently 1000, if evhz is correct. </p> <p>I&#39;m using the Logitech G502 Proteus gaming mouse. I&#39;m using OSD memory for basic stuff, but polling rate is another story.</p> <p>How do I fix this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WaffleBrewer"> /u/WaffleBrewer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j2kbmo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I got a Turtle Beach VelocityOne flight yoke for Christmas last year and have happily been using it with my Xbox on MSFS2020 &amp; 2024. However, when trying to use it with my PC on FSX or X-Plane 11, it just shows up as 2 Xbox controllers and I can&#39;t figure out how to configure it. Does a workaround/fix exist? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DragonflyCreepy2939"> /u/DragonflyCreepy2939 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j29k2u/turtle_beach_velocityone_yoke_on_zorin_os_171_pro/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j29k2u/turtle_beach_velocityone_yoke_on_zorin_os_171_pro/">[comments]</a></span>
