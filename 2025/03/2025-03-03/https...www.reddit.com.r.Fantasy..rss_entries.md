## If you've been lurking here for a while, you've seen "The Curse of Chalion" and "Paladin of Souls" pop up somewhere halfway down most recommendation threads. I am speaking directly to you: Read Them.

Like stated above, I&#39;d occasionally see the names of these novels, by Lois McMaster Bujold, appear in the lower half of numerous recommendation threads, and curiosity finally won out.</p> <p>Both novels, <em>The Curse of Chalion</em> and <em>Paladin of Souls</em>, take place in Bujold&#39;s World of the Five Gods. Both novels are often said to be standalone, but I frankly disagree with that assessment, since <em>Paladin</em> regularly makes reference to the events that unfold in <em>Curse</em>, which takes place only a few years before. There are more novels in this series, but I have not yet read them.</p> <p>Why should you read these? Both novels are extraordinarily well written, and Bujold&#39;s natural dry wit permeates through the respective protagonists&#39; voices throughout each novel. Every word on the page feels 100% intentional, so precisely

Specifically:</p> <ol> <li>There is <em>a lot</em> of telling rather than showing. When a writer is good at &quot;showing&quot;, it makes it so we readers feel the emotions the characters feel. When a writer merely &quot;tells&quot; the reader what the character feels, we readers know what the character feels, but we don&#39;t feel it ourselves.

It&#39;s like advertised as a comedy sci-fi and the premise of having to deal with your copies strikes me as interesting story.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I felt underwhelmed by the book, mostly because of my expectations. It ended up being a guy saving a colony from creatures that may destroy them. They could have just removed the expandable thing and it would still be the same story.</p> <p>&quot;Hiding your double because you&#39;re both going to get killed&quot; felt like a side plot. I would have preferred if it played more in the story but sadly it didn&#39;t.</p> <p>Anyone also felt something like this or did I just missed some things?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kalle_022"> /u/Kalle_022 <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>as the title suggests, I am trying to track down a series of small fantasy books i remember having when i was 7 or 8 years old back in the 90s. they were hard covered art books not much bigger than the palm of your hand and, i think from memory there was maybe 5 books in the series. I had 2 of them i remember the cover of one of them was brown around the edges with a stone arch/window in the middle, the other one was blue and had from memory what could have been a sliver from mtg or a pterodactyl type creature. or it could have been like a gate in the sewers. i know that my descriptions are bad but please, any help in tracking down these books would be much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Difficult-Jeweler624"> /u/Difficult-Jeweler624 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j2fy36/palm_sized_art_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.r

## Fantasy books to read with my 9 yo daughter?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We started from The Hobbit when she was barely understanding what fantasy is, and now I&#39;m struggling to find a title that would make her interested. Lord of The Rings started well (because we watched the movie), but you know this book, its not just so engaging for a 9 yo. Last night I made an attempt into the Dark Elf, and just after 30 pages she asked for another book. Finally, we ended up with Coraline by Neil Gayman (I am not his fan but American Gods is great and Coraline is incredible). So, if reading daddies are here, what kind of fantasy do you read to your kids now? There is also a translation problem, I suppose newer books have no translation into our language and i won&#39;t find them for her, but I managed to translate some English books as we read 😁 (Black Company, not for children definitely)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Late-Canary18"> /u/Late-Canary18 </a> <br/> <span><a hre
