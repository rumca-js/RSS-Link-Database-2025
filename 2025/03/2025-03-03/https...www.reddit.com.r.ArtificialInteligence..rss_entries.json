Even though it did help me, at least somewhat, I can\u2019t help but be convinced it was AI.</p> <p>See, the responses took a long time, and I mean, a long time. And every message sounded like it was straight from ChatGPT. Like it was analyzing my words and generating something to say. I\u2019d say it was even faker than AI. It felt like I was talking to a robot.</p> <p>Another thing is, I\u2019ve talked to people online who\u2019ve used this hotline, and everyone got a counselor with a very generic name. Most commonly, Laura or Ashley. I\u2019ve seen at least a dozen people talk about how they had someone named Ashley who was super sweet. Most people get matched with the same few \u201cpeople,\u201d either that or there\u2019s a ton of Ashleys who decided to work for 988.</p> <p>Typing. A lot of words didn\u2019t make sense, almost like they were caused by glitches. One example is a few random letters spammed in the middle",

Just FYI I sleep a lot because I have kidney failure and I&#39;m waiting for a transplant I also had a heart attack a year ago so I get tired. The problem is I never discussed this with Gemini the first time I have ever spoken with it was today and the first conversation was this one which was about cats. I asked it how it knew and it said all cats sleep a lot and when I said no how did you know I sleep a lot it just brushed me off and apologised and explained to me that I must have somehow told it!!!
