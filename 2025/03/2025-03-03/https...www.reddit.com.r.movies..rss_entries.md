It’s possible you would figure it out and make an escape but it’s also possible that wouldn’t happen.</p> <p>On the other hand in Groundhog Day, it’s really the opposite because in the Truman show everyone else knows what’s happening and you don’t but in Groundhog Day, you’re the only one who knows that the day is repeating over and over again, you’re the only one that can comprehend what is really happening in a lot of ways you’re the only one who is real, and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>SPOILERS: I genuinely used to not understand the hype when I was younger and I only judged the film on a couple of clips and never saw the whole thing, I can now say that I was ignorant. I saw the film a bunch of times in the last few years in it’s entirety, and I grew to absolutely adore the film, it’s now in my top 10 of all time, everything about it, the whole idea of hope and believing that one day things will be better. Morgan Freeman’s narration is absolutely perfect and he has so much soul in his voice, they couldn’t have picked a better person for Red. The entire scene with Brooks’s monologue and him committing suicide after being in prison for 50+ years has brought a tear to my eye every time I see it. The setting, the acting, the characters, the message, it is all top notch, and the cherry on top is the ending. The ending is so satisfying, after all the misery and hardship, Andy and Red reuniting on the beach in Mexico. It is such a beautif

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now that the awards season is over, there’s something I’d like to vent about. While most of the discussion surrounding the Oscar-nominated movies revolved around the likes of Anora, The Brutalist, Conclave, and Emilia Perez, I couldn’t help but notice that I’m Still Here was overlooked by most moviegoers. For instance, Fernanda Torres, the lead actress of I’m Still Here, delivered a performance that was every bit as Oscar-caliber as anyone else’s. However, in the outcry over Mikey Madison’s victory, I struggled to see anyone mentioning her in the Oscar’s threads as a potential contender, especially compared to Demi Moore, who many people thought deserved the award (though Fernanda was my first choice).</p> <p>The reason for this is simple: not many people bothered to watch I’m Still Here in the first place. And I’d like to encourage you to do just that. I’m biased, of course, as a Brazilian, but I’m Still Here tells a unique story (that of Eunice Pai

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently watched Juno for the first time since I was about 13 or 14. I was in junior high I believe when the movie first released, and seeing it as an adult really blew my mind. The creators somehow perfectly captured the awkward and intense feelings of not being a kid, but not quite an adult yet either. </p> <p>First note, Mark was a massive creep and weirdo. Kissing a teenage girl when you’re an adult is creepy and gross all on its own. Then you throw in that SHE WAS CARRYING THEIR ADOPTIVE CHILD. What the actual fuck! What a disgusting pathetic man. Watching the scene when he took Juno to the basement to show her the comic of a pregnant super hero was so disgusting. Their relationship in general was coming off very grooming, then he was seducing a pregnant 16 year old girl who was extremely vulnerable. In my young teenage mind, I thought Vanessa was such a wet blanket, suppressing his creative side and making him and Juno both feel like losers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Spoilers for Naked Lunch dir David Cronenberg </p> <p>I have read the book as well as the book Queer which the movie Naked Lunch also takes inspiration from and feel like for the most part I get what&#39;s going on. But the cage scene, when he is at Yves&#39;s house with Kiki and then sees a man in a cage being killed? by the other man/creature thing. Was that Kiki and Yves? When he returns to his apartment he says it was a set up and he had been meant to be in the cage. But I&#39;m just confused what that scene at Yves house represents. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fancyflamigo"> /u/fancyflamigo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j28kl4/what_was_the_meaning_of_the_cage_scene_in_naked/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j28kl4/what_was_the_meaning_of_the_cage_scene_in_naked/">[comments]</a></span>
