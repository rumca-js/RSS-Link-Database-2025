<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a top end gaming PC and have only used VR once on my PS5. I loved the PSVR2 but it kind of sucked for how limited it was because it only worked on PS5 (at the time) so I sold that and my PS5 and got back into gaming.</p> <p>So… I know nothing about VRs other than I think they’re cool. I don’t care that the Meta 3 is portable because I won’t really use it for that (unless I can use it as a monitor for a steam deck). It’s mostly going to just be plugged to my tower and I really want to play games like res 8 and blade &amp; sorcery.</p> <p>They’re relatively close in price- so what’s better?</p> <p>I know PSVR2 is compatible with PC now, but how well? Does it run pretty smoothly with steam and so on, or Sony just being lazy again? Can both headsets be able to be used as a virtual monitor so my wife stops yelling at me using our bedroom TV? </p> <p>I appreciate the time and help on this! Thanks! I look forward to the comment section war </p> </div

But from what i read, Quest 3 offers only 2064×2208 per eye. Does that mean im just wasting my resources running it this way? Should i go down with settings to what Quest 3 can output?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>No matter how advanced VR gets, true immersion will always be limited if we ignore the other human senses. Sight and sound are already well replicated, but a VR headset alone won’t deliver a <em>Matrix</em>-like experience where you can actually <em>feel</em> virtual water on your skin.</p> <p>I wonder when technology like Neuralink will be able to send sensory signals directly to the brain, making it possible to <em>touch</em> and <em>feel</em> things in a virtual world. In theory, an AI model could learn to interpret neural activity related to touch and recreate those sensations using a brain-computer interface.</p> <p>If you had to make a prediction, when do you think this could become a reality—the 2030s, 2040s, or 2050s?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Care_Best"> /u/Care_Best </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j2bqmw/what_decade_will_brain_computer_i
