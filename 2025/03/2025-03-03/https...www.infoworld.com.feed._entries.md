<p>“No man is an island,” <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">wrote John Donne</a>. But containers certainly are. They are created as islands in and of themselves, packaged with all they need to operate independently—code, dependencies, and runtime. This autonomy is great for security but not so great for networking.</p>



<p>Just as a person needs community, distributed workloads depend on connections between containers to function as a whole. “In the world of distributed computing, everything goes over the network, making it the critical component for applications to work and work together,” says Bill Mulligan, head of community at Isovalent, the company behind <a href="https://

<p>Since 2018, we’ve had a new release of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3296360/what-is-the-jdk-introduction-to-the-java-development-kit.html">Java platform</a> every six months. With Swiss watch-like regularity, the latest version of Java, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html">JDK 24</a>, is upon us. In an almost poetic way, JDK 24 contains 24 JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), the largest number of new features since the introduction of the time-based release schedule.</p>



<p>I won’t go through each of them, as 10 are preview features, incubator modules, or experimental. Let’s look at the ones that will be most interesting

<p>Clearly Google is doing something right. Although Google Cloud’s revenue still lags AWS and Microsoft Azure, it’s <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/aws-vs-microsoft-vs-google-cloud-earnings-q4-2024-face-off?page=3">growing much faster</a> (albeit on a smaller base). But that’s not the real story of its growth. The story is that it’s growing at all. Google Cloud should have been knocked out in the second round given AWS’s years-long head start and Microsoft’s enterprise IT dominance. Google is booming, particularly now given its strength in AI. By some accounts, its newest <a href="https://fireflies.ai/blog/gemini-vs-gpt-4">Gemini model meets or exceeds OpenAI’s GPT-4</a> in areas lik
