<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I’m Ofri, and along with Nadav and the team, we’ve been working on GoatDB, a lightweight, offline-first, real-time NoDB for Deno &amp; React.</p> <p>Why We Built GoatDBWhile working on ovvio.io, a real-time collaboration SaaS for enterprise clients, we ran into challenges with existing databases. Some were too heavy, others were too expansive, and many lacked proper offline-first support. So, we built GoatDB - a scalable, self-hosted solution that works across both cloud and edge environments. GoatDB simplifies development by letting you write a single TypeScript codebase that runs seamlessly on both the client and server. There’s no need for separate APIs or manual data sync logic. It’s lightweight, real-time, and self-contained, making deployments as simple as running a single executable.</p> <p>Key Features * No Dedicated Infra: Run the entire DB client-side, with incremental queries that remove the need for server-side indexing. * R
