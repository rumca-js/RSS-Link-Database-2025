<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For this project targeting a city in Canada with a population of 5 million, I built 120,000 backlinks in just four months. This effort quickly increased our Semrush authority from 8 to 25, and many of our main keywords, which previously had no rankings, now rank between positions 3 and 10 . You can view the picture I posted on local SEO.</p> <p>As an SEOer, outranking high-volume main keywords in a niche is a major achievement. Top competitors are typically trusted brands with excellent SEO, brand, and social media,,, and almost they do well all of it. To help a small brand that isn&#39;t ranking can out rank top 1-4, you need to do more in SEO —and do it better—than those top competitors, even with a smaller budget and must rank in a short time. That&#39;s why I love using mass backlinks and Pinterest.</p> <p>So, I think for Google, building 100 or even 1,000 links per day could not be a problem. As long as your links are ok and your on-page SEO is

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been using AI to write posts. I followed Google’s SEO recommendations and applied insight from the top-ranking articles. The results are pretty good. As I didn’t think my AI stuff was super valuable, I’m surprised.</p> <p>Then I thought more. Most blogs were trash even before AI. They didn’t help readers. They just used SEO to ramble and sell stuff. The blog post by Indians and South East Asian freelancers repeatedly topped Google. Google’s always sucked at blocking junk. AI just helped make junk a lot easier.</p> <p>I was using Google less, even before AI. I used Reddit more instead. Google was going bad even without AI. Google can’t find good info anymore. It’s not all Google’s fault. There’s just way too much garbage now. SEO is dead.</p> <p>Blog posts will be a viable customer acquisition channel. But as a consumer, finding real/helpful info will be harder.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/use

How does making the links nofollow help our site?</strong> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Prevents passing link equity:</strong> A nofollow attribute tells search engines not to pass authority to the linked site. This helps retain SEO value instead of distributing it elsewhere. </li> </ul> <p><strong>2. How does making the link dofollow hurt?</strong> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Loses SEO authority:</strong> A dofollow link passes link equity to the external site, meaning SEO power is shared. </li> <li><strong>Unne

## Internal linking strategy for a website that sells a single product?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>All tutorials on internal linking seem to advise to link <em>away</em> from the home page towards more specific pages. This is often conceptualized as a pyramid or inverse tree structure, with the home page at the top, more general categories below that, and then individual pages at the bottom.</p> <p>But all these tutorials assume a website that offers a range of different products or services and that the website visitor therefore needs to be guided from the landing page toward the specific product or service he or she wants to buy, similar to a supermarket, where the customer enters through the door (the home page) and is lead through different departments for food or clothing or hardware (the category pages) towards the product they seek (the individual webpages for bananas, apples and so on).</p> <p>But my webpage only sells a single product (coaching with me) and the call to action (my contact data with a button for calling me and another for s
