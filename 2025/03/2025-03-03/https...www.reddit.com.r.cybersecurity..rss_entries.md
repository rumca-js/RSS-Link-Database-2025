However, I’ve noticed that the highly restricted environment and encrypted data make it extremely challenging to find vulnerabilities, let alone exploit them. Given these constraints, I feel that application security testing may no longer require the same level of hands-on skills, as there’s little we can do in such an environment.</p> <p>Considering this, I believe it might be beneficial to shift my focus toward other areas, such as Active Directory (AD) exploitation, network exploitation, and malware analysis.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ayo!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on a project that I hope can contribute something useful to our community. It’s called <strong>CVSS-TE (Threat-Enhanced Vulnerability Scoring System)</strong>, and it&#39;s an extension of the ideas found in another GitHub project, CVSS-BT which itself adds more depth to NVD&#39;s CVSS scores.</p> <p>While digging through GitHub, I found CVSS-BT really intriguing as it incorporates Temporal/Threat Metrics into the CVSS scores. It got me thinking: could we go further? Could we add even more context to how we view and prioritize vulnerabilities?</p> <p>So, I started working on CVSS-TE, which aims to add even more granularity by factoring in the quality of exploits and integrating broader threat intelligence. It’s a bit like looking at vulnerabilities through a new lens that not only scores them but tries to paint a clearer picture of their real-world impact.</p> <p>The GitHub repo for CVSS-TE is updated daily to ensure

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there, everyone. </p> <p>So, I have recently been tasked with learning and configuring MS Sentinel for an organization. </p> <p>So, a thing that has been bugging me is how do I analyze logs, in general? I mean how do you query data that maybe of your interest? Given the amount of data that is ingested every second, how does one go about searching for data that could potentially be suspicious?</p> <p>Are there some basic &quot;methodologies &quot; one should be aware of? Any suggestions or recommendations to better streamline my workflow?</p> <p>TIA 😊</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Practical-Violinist9"> /u/Practical-Violinist9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j29jif/soc_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j29jif/soc_help/">[comments]</a></span>
