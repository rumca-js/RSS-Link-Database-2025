pump and dumps were discussed on Joe Rogan's conversation with Elon Musk -- the main question being, how is this legal? The answer is that social security is a scam anyways.

Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it the "opportunity of a lifetime."
