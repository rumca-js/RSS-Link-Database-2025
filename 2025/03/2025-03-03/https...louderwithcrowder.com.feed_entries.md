<p>A family moved from Washington to Colorado and was beside themselves after figuring their cat got spooked and ran away while loading the moving truck. So while they searched high and low, they had no choice but to head to their new destination without their feline companion. </p>
<p>After three long weeks, the family presumed the worst, which is that they will never see their cat, Sunny-Loo, again. However, after three weeks their cat was found alive when the movers dropped off their sofa. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

"He's unelected," cries journalismers as they light their Anthony Fauci prayer candles. And, like any time the media and the left (but I repeat myself) have a political disagreement, they accuse you of racism. Today that means the New York Times' pathetic attempt to die Cousin Elon to South African apartheid.</p><p>Mind you, this is the same NYT that's ok with apartheid when it targets white people.

Even though you may not <em>need</em> to have health insurance. Medical procedures and check-ups can sometimes be cheaper without health insurance. But if you have health insurance, they can be more expensive for you than if you didn't have health insurance. And if you have health insurance, you can't choose not to use your health insurance. Make sense? Of course not. And neither does this father's story.</p><p>His daughter needed a life-saving ambulance ride, which cost $600. Then he got a bill for $1300. Either his insurance company charged $2300, or the ambulance charged $2300. Either way, insurance only covered $1000. And now the dad has to pay $1300, even though he could have paid $600.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
