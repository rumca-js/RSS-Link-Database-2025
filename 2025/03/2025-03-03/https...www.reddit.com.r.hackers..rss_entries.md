<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>if i run a local server for my video game that just connect a leaderboard, it does have input and output capabilities involved to fetch/display and save to (just a txt file). if i make the script reject any unwanted characters and only recognize letters and numbers and block my ip and restrict its “viewability” and only allow one space and 20 characters per entry you think ill be good? im making the game on unity and connecting via socket.io to a node.js server its just running on my local ip so i dont know if thats wise, should i connect it to a vpn or something? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Business_Grand_666"> /u/Business_Grand_666 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1j2kpvl/whats_the_chance_of_me_getting_hacked/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1j2kpvl/whats_the_chance_of_me_getting_hacked/">[comments]</a></s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been being stalked for 5 or 6 years by a mystery person. It&#39;s been reddit and Instagram accounts that pop back up every few months. I have all the proof in the world but police couldn&#39;t care less. This person seems to know dangerous information about me like where I used to live, what my full legal name is, what I do for work, and many other personal details. It&#39;s clear that they are most likely someone I know and interact with or have history with, and they seem to enjoy worrying me and checking up on me. So how does a noob like myself get started? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll need to take matters into my own hands!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LuckyBlueLo"> /u/LuckyBlueLo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1j2aw37/how_does_one_hack_an_instagram_account_or_reveal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/commen
