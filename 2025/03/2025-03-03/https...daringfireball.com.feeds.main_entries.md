<blockquote>
  <p>In a whitepaper posted to Apple’s developer site entitled
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Helping-Protect-Kids-Online-2025.pdf">“Helping Protect Kids Online”</a>, the company details
several improvements it’s rolling out in upcoming software
updates, including making it easier to set up child accounts,
providing age ranges to developers, and filtering content on the
App Store. [...]</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that these announcements are happening
against the backdrop of more stringent age-verification laws
enacted in U.S. states like Texas and Oklahoma. <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2025/02/25/lgbtq-abortion-censorship-age-verification-laws/">Critics of those
laws</a> contend that they unfairly target LGBTQ+ communities.
Apple, for its part, says that it holds to a standard of data
minimization, not sharing any more information than is necessary.
So, for example, offering developers access to th

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask anyone about their experience of using websites on their
mobile device. They’ll tell you plenty of stories of how badly
it sucks.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter that the web is the perfect medium for
just-in-time delivery of information. It doesn’t matter that web
browsers can now do just about everything that native apps can do.</p>

<p>In many ways, I wish this were a technical problem. At least then
we could lobby for some technical advancement that would fix this
situation.</p>

<p>But this is not a technical problem. This is a people problem.
Specifically, the people who make websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are mobile web proponents who are in denial about this state of affairs, who seek to place the blame at Apple’s feet for the fact that WebKit is the only rendering engine available on iOS. But WebKit’s limitations have nothing to do with the reasons so many websites suck when experienced on mobile devices. The m

<p>Jason Snell, writing last week at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While a lot of us have gotten excited about the potential of
Apple’s immersive video format, the truth is that the Vision Pro
is also a great viewer of more traditional 3-D video content. And
Apple has built a new visionOS app to highlight great spatial
content: Spatial Gallery.</p>

<p>Think of Spatial Gallery as something sort of like the TV app, but
for spatial videos, photos, and panoramas. The content comes from
Apple as well as third-party content sources, and Apple is
curating it all itself. The company says the content will be
updated on a regular basis, and among the demo content I saw
featured was some of 3-D (not immersive) behind-the-scenes content
from various Apple TV+ productions such as “Severance” and
“Shrinking.”</p>

<p>Just as the Apple Watch has its own app on iOS, so too will the
Vision Pro. The new Vision Pro iOS app will be available with iOS
18.4, and will automatically appear on the iPho

<p>Like any great caricature, Myers’s Elon Musk conveys a better sense of Musk than watching Musk himself does. A cruel and infinitely self-satisfied know-it-all, whose utter self-confidence runs counter to the fact that he’s unfathomably awkward, as uncoordinated socially as he is physically. Just an utter and total spaz, who believes no one’s jokes are funnier than his own. The sort of person <em>no one likes</em> but yet has parlayed tremendous wealth into great power, forcing his influence upon the world.</p>
