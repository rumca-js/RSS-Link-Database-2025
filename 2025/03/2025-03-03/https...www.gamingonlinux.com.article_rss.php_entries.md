If you want to mount your Steam Deck to a wall, you could do so with something like the Deckmate but the MechLock looks far slicker with the super-smooth locking system where you can add a charger.<p><img src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/tagline_images/1052311067id26295gol.jpg" alt />.</p><p>Read the full article on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/the-mechlock-wall-mount-for-steam-deck-looks-ridiculously-slick/">GamingOnLinux</a>.</p>
