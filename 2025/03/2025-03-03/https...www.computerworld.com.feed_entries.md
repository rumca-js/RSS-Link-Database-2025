<p>Mozilla last week updated the Firefox user agreement — something that normally does not provoke strong reactions.</p>



<p>This time, however, the changes led to a wave of criticism, because some of the wording can be interpreted as giving Mozilla free rein to do whatever it wants with users’ data. In particular, the following paragraph has raised user ire:</p>



<p><em>“When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox”</em></p>

<p>When science fiction writer Isaac Asimov published his proposed <a href="https://webhome.auburn.edu/~vestmon/robotics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three rules of robotics</a> (back in 1942, amazingly enough), it assumed the hard-wired instructions would be mandatory. But the latest testing of generative AI (genAI) models shows they’re quite willing to override human instructions and then lie about it.</p>

<p>In a blistering critique, former Intel CEO and Chairman Craig Barrett has strongly opposed breaking the company into separate design and foundry units, arguing that Intel’s recent technological resurgence positions it to challenge TSMC’s dominance in the semiconductor industry without corporate dismantling.</p>



<p>Barrett also dismissed calls from four former Intel board members who suggested that splitting the company would be the only viable solution to its struggles.</p>



<p>“Intel is about to regain its leadership in this area, and the dumbest idea around is to stall that from happening by slicing the company into pieces,” Barett wrote in an opinion piece in <a href="https://fortune.co

<p>Enterprise mobility today is basically synonymous with <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1614495/what-is-uem-unified-endpoint-management-explained.html">unified endpoint management</a> (UEM) software, which unifies and centralizes the management of phones, tablets, PCs, and other devices. UEM grew out of earlier mobile management tools in the late teens and came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic when office workers worldwide shifted to remote work.</p>



<p>Now a well-established product category, UEM platforms have continued to broaden their scope and introduce new features. Here are the most important trends to know about in 2025.</p>
