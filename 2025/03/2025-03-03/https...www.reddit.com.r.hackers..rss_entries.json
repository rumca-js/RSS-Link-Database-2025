It&#39;s been reddit and Instagram accounts that pop back up every few months. I have all the proof in the world but police couldn&#39;t care less. This person seems to know dangerous information about me like where I used to live, what my full legal name is, what I do for work, and many other personal details. It&#39;s clear that they are most likely someone I know and interact with or have history with, and they seem to enjoy worrying me and checking up on me. So how does a noob like myself get started? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll need to take matters into my own hands!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LuckyBlueLo\"> /u/LuckyBlueLo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1j2aw37/how_does_one_hack_an_instagram_account_or_reveal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/commen",
