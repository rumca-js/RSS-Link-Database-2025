[...]</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that these announcements are happening\nagainst the backdrop of more stringent age-verification laws\nenacted in U.S. states like Texas and Oklahoma. <a href=\"https://msmagazine.com/2025/02/25/lgbtq-abortion-censorship-age-verification-laws/\">Critics of those\nlaws</a> contend that they unfairly target LGBTQ+ communities.\nApple, for its part, says that it holds to a standard of data\nminimization, not sharing any more information than is necessary.\nSo, for example, offering developers access to th",

The content comes from\nApple as well as third-party content sources, and Apple is\ncurating it all itself. The company says the content will be\nupdated on a regular basis, and among the demo content I saw\nfeatured was some of 3-D (not immersive) behind-the-scenes content\nfrom various Apple TV+ productions such as \u201cSeverance\u201d and\n\u201cShrinking.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Just as the Apple Watch has its own app on iOS, so too will the\nVision Pro.
