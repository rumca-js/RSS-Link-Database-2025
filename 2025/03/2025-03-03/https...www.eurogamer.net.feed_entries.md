## PokÃ©mon games have become consistently ugly, and it's alright to wish they weren't

This includes last week's full reveal of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pok&eacute;mon Legends Z-A</a>, which going from the first bit of footage seems to feature a lot of hazy-edged grey rooftops, futurist UI, and eerily smooth NPCs, and not a lot of consistent, nice-to-look-at art direction to tie it together. This is also a shame. First, because - and I don't think it's too controversial to say this - it's good, generally speaking, when things look nice. Glad we've got that established.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-games-have-become-consistently-ugly-and-its-alright-to-wish-they-werent">Read more</a></p>
