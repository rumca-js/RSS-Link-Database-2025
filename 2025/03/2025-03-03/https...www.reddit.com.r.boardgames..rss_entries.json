The player on my right happened to draw another fleas card and then immediately played it to counter the fleas. </p> <p>I questioned that play and referred to the rulebook which states, \u201cForce the player directly on your left and right to draw a card or play a Fleas card of their own.

You may not play a second fleas card to counter their response.\u201d</p> <p>Based on the wording of the Fleas rule it\u2019s my understanding that you cannot play a fleas card to counter if you drew the card because a different player played a fleas card on their turn. </p> <p>I texted grandpa Beck and this is the response I received, \u201cFleas can only be played on your turn.\u201d Which further backs up my",

A friend of mine offered to sell me Twilight Struggle and Terraforming Mars at $20 each. I\u2019m not really sure which one to get (not going to get both, already have too many games), so I was hoping for some advice. Twilight struggle sounds cool, but I don\u2019t really have anyone specific who I think would be willing to sit down and play with me more than once or twice. Terraforming Mars seems pretty cool, but I haven\u2019t really played anything like it and from what I hear the Prelude expansion is mandatory. I\u2019m not really sure if that\u2019s something I want to get into right away. Any advice would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/galcticcat\"> /u/galcticcat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j2b7yv/twilight_struggle_or_terraforming_mars/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",
