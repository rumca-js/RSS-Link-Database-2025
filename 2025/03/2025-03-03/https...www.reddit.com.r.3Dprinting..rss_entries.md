She plans on using it in her restaurant to make food a bit easier and less tedious to prepare. It&#39;s similar to a mold in terms of how it&#39;s used; food is lightly pressed against it for a few seconds, but nothing will make contact with it for a prolonged period of time. She can hand-wash it so there&#39;s no risk of it warping in a dishwasher.

Usually a small amount of coating material in liquid form is applied on the center of the substrate, which is either spinning at low speed or not spinning at all. The substrate is then rotated at speeds up to 10,000 rpm to spread the coating material by centrifugal force. </p> <p>The use case for me would be to coat raw PCB boards with photo-resistive ink or silk screen. I would be interested in getting your feedback. If interested to collaborate on this project, dm and let&#39;s
