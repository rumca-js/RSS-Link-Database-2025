However, I\u2019ve noticed that the highly restricted environment and encrypted data make it extremely challenging to find vulnerabilities, let alone exploit them. Given these constraints, I feel that application security testing may no longer require the same level of hands-on skills, as there\u2019s little we can do in such an environment.</p> <p>Considering this, I believe it might be beneficial to shift my focus toward other areas, such as Active Directory (AD) exploitation, network exploitation, and malware analysis.
