<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, I have been learning Front end for a quite long while now. I am familiar with the frameworks and made a couple projects for self improvement and learning. I just saw a couple posts that frustrated my beginner assðŸ˜† so I just wanna ask is it really that late? I am looking forward to be a full stack developer but such posts made my energy go down.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wolf-hunt1152003"> /u/Wolf-hunt1152003 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1j2ua9x/is_it_too_late_for_front_end_developers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1j2ua9x/is_it_too_late_for_front_end_developers/">[comments]</a></span>

Should i join classes . Please any suggestions any guidance will be helpful. I am lost and clueless and not sure whom to ask for guidance.
