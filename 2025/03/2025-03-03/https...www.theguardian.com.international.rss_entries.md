<p>The world’s most admired democracy is being held hostage by a clique of far-right thugs. It would be a mistake to placate them</p><p>It’s not only about Donald Trump. It’s not just about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/02/ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-donald-trump-us-europe-eu-russia-defence-latest-live-news">saving Ukraine</a>, or defeating Russia, or how to boost Europe’s security, or what to do about an America gone rogue. It’s about a world turned upside down – a dark, fretful, more dangerous place where treaties and laws are no longer respected, alliances are broken, trust is fungible, principles are negotiable and morality is a dirty word. It’s an ugly, disordered world of raw power, brute force, selfish arrogance, dodgy deals and brazen lies. It’s been coming for a while; the US president is its noisy harbinger.</p><p>Take the issues one at a time. Trump is a toxic symptom of the wider malaise. For sure, he is an extraordinarily malig

<p>An egregious non-call in the ninth round allowed Tank Davis to avoid a knockdown, altering the course of his title fight against Lamont Roach Jr on Saturday night</p><p>An egregious non-call by referee Steve Willis allowed Gervonta Davis to salvage a draw on the judges’ scorecards in Davis’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/02/gervonta-tank-davis-lamont-roach-fight-report">WBA 135lb title defense against Lamont Roach</a> at Barclays Center on Saturday night.</p><p>Davis (now 30-0-1, 28 KOs), has been fighting professionally for 12 years. At age 30, he’s an elite fighter with a fervent fanbase that includes 7.6m followers on Instagram. He has yet to permeate the consciousness of mainstream sports fans. But for his admirers, every Gervonta Davis fight is a happening. Davis v Roach set the all-time event attendance record in the history of Barclays Center. The sold-out crowd of 19,250 engendered the arena’s second-largest gross ever, eclipsed only by the Rolling St

<p>Trump cutting off USAid reminds us how much power we surrender to those who fund our work. We need a new mindset</p><p>About 35 years ago, the radio news announced that the then president of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi, had broken diplomatic ties with Norway. The embassy, with about 100 foreign and a few local staff, had one week to clear out of the country.</p><p>I was one of a few staff there at the time who worked for the Norwegian development agency, Norad, and our jobs disappeared with that radio broadcast. An estimated $30m annual budget, largely targeted at the arid and semi-arid parts of Kenya, also disappeared. Obviously that did not matter much to Kenya’s leadership, who felt that the independence of the country and the ability for them to decide what was good for Kenya, was more important.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/03/those-of-us-who-rely-on-aid-must-accept-the-new-reality-and-shape-our-own-destiny">Continue reading...</a>
