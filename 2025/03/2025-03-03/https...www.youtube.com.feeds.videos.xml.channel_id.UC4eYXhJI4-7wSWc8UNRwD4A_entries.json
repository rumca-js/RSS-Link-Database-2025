        "description": "Tom Huizenga | March 3, 2025\nAbel Selaocoe arrived early for his Tiny Desk performance so he could pop into a studio to talk with NPR\u2019s Morning Edition. That\u2019s where the versatile South African cellist and vocalist told the touching story of how he first got the hang of his instrument. Unable to afford a real cello, Selaocoe drew the strings of the instrument on paper, then pasted it to his chest to practice the fingerings.  \n\nThese days, he tours the world offering his singular synthesis of global, jazz and classical sounds, always remembering his roots, even when collaborating with the likes of Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nSelaocoe\u2019s adroit bowing and percussive fingering gives the cello a vast color palette, with sounds of flutes and drums. His vocalizing, mostly in the Sesotho language, includes a kind of gravelly throat singing in which two or more pitches are produced, heard in the opening song which he dedicates to mothers and strong women who \u201c[hold] the knife on the sharp side.\u201d  \n\nFrench bar",
