A new study has analysed ancient DNA from 370 individuals buried between the fourth and sixth centuries, revealing that the European Huns were genetically diverse. While some showed direct ties to Xiongnu elites from Mongolia, most carried mixed Northeast Asian ancestry. Researchers found no evidence of a single large-scale migration but instead observed long-term intermixing. The findings indicate that the Huns were not a homogenous group but rather a population formed through centuries of movement, alliances, and cultural blending.

China's Zhurong rover has uncovered evidence of an ancient ocean on Mars, with ground-penetrating radar detecting a buried shoreline beneath the Utopia Basin. The rover’s scans revealed sloping sand layers similar to those found on Earth’s beaches, reinforcing theories of long-term water presence. Experts highlight that these formations are not volcanic or impact-related, strengthening the argument for Mars' past habitability. The discovery adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the Red Planet once had conditions suitable for sustaining life.

Scientists recreated Martian dust in labs and found that the mineral remained stable despite the planet’s dry conditions. Data from orbiting spacecraft and rovers confirm this discovery, reshaping theories about Mars’ climate history. Future missions aim to analyse Martian samples further to uncover more about the planet’s potential to have once supported life.

Scientists have studied the solar system’s passage through the Orion complex, a dense region in space, around 14 million years ago. According to researchers, this movement may have compressed the heliosphere and increased interstellar dust reaching Earth. This dust could have influenced the planet’s climate and left traces in geological records. While the primary factor in the Middle Miocene Climate Transition was likely a drop in carbon dioxide levels, experts are exploring the role of cosmic activity in past climate changes.
