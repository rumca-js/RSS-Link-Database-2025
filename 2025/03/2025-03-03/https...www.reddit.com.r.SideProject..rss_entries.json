Users complete daily tasks related to fitness, discipline, mental growth, and productivity to earn XP and level up in real life. The app includes a streak tracking system to encourage consistency, leaderboards for competition, and a punishment system that enforces accountability. If a user fails to complete tasks, they lose XP, break their streak, or face self-set consequences such as financial penalties or social accountability measures. The goal is to make personal growth as addictive as a video game while ensuring real-world results.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently in the MVP stage, refining the core concept and exploring development options.

During this time, a lot happened in my personal life: my daughter was born, before that I traveled a lot, and I definitely didn\u2019t work on this every day.
