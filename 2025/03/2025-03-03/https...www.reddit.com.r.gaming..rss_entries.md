<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember a game that I used to play on some website many years ago. It&#39;s free to play, at least to a certain point. </p> <p>The game takes place on an island that is in fact a giant turtle. I think you play as a rabbit or some other animal, and there&#39;s a village community on the island, where you can interact and buy stuff from the NPCs and whatnot, kind of like Stardew Valley. And I think at some point in the game, the turtle island would submerge into the water below (maybe if you didn&#39;t pay to continue playing, I&#39;m not sure).</p> <p>Anybody know what this game might be?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimmy_The_Grunt"> /u/Jimmy_The_Grunt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j2hv7p/could_someone_help_me_find_a_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j2hv7p/could_someone_help_me_find_a_game/">[commen
