I plan to do a sequel that is set in the early 1950s in East Germany. I have found some books on Amazon that look to have what I need but what are the best books that discuss the life in Soviet occupied Germany?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Titan-828"> /u/Titan-828 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j2uvuj/best_books_about_life_in_the_soviet_occupation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j2u

I don’t personally know any trans people well enough to have a deep and potentially difficult conversation about this, but I want to learn.</p> <p>My therapist suggested I read a memoir or other books to help broaden my understanding, so I’m looking for recommendations. Ideally, I’d like something that gives personal insight into what it feels like to be trans, but I’m open to anything that would help me understand better.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Classroom_8347"> /u/No_Classroom_8347 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j2uboz/looking_for_memoirsbooks_to_better_u

I read Atwater’s Regency Faerie Tales having heard they were similar in style to the above two series, and they were enjoyable enough, but I didn’t love them. </p> <p>What I particularly appreciate about the Emily Wilde books (and the dragon series) is how well-written they are on the sentence level. I also could not enjoy the landscape/faerie descriptions more. And the Emily/Wendell dynamic (and Shadow and Orga’s) is delightful. </p> <p>Any suggestions? In terms of other fantasy I’ve enjoyed, I’m a huge LOTR nerd. I also loved the Chronicle of Narnia books as a kid. I get that these are not similar to the Emily Wilde or History of Dragons series but hoping this is helpful context. Favorite authors are probably Dostoevsky, DFW, Atwood, and Kundera (in that order), if that helps. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC

But I want to read good books, no matter what the subject matter. I just read Penance (a thriller and crime book), and I really enjoyed it and learned from it. I could go on google and ask “best philosophy, best books of all time” or something like that, but I want to hear read from real people and why the book is important to you.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I enjoyed some of J. D. Salinger material; Holden and the sex worker, or the Franny and Zoe date scene in the beginning.</p> <p>Also enjoyed sections from Ove Knausgaard&#39;s earlier books, in which he first meets and dates the person who later becomes his wife.</p> <p>Or even some of the romantic scenes from Norwegian Wood by Murakami. Not the magical realism parts though.</p> <p>Question is, can you recommend something similar?<br/> Any quality reading which is either romantic, contemporary, intricate, relationship centered, etc.<br/> Not interested in mystery or thriller elements though. At least not as a central part of the plot.</p> <p>Thanks,<br/> My love life is in shambles, so I look to books for comfort.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/urban__monk"> /u/urban__monk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j2q9lh/looking_for_specific

I can&#39;t find anyone who has read or enjoyed this book as much as I do. If you have read it, come forward and tell me what you liked about this book, I would very much like to know everyone&#39;s perception and opinion. Also recommend similar books to me, I am literally in despair, I WANT to rediscover this atmosphere and this kind of relationship that I read a year ago. If you haven&#39;t read it yet, read it lol.

I believe I read it on Wattpad - it was so well-written though, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s published!</p> <p>So the FMC (she&#39;s a scientist) somehow ends up teleporting (?) to an alien universe. The MMC (an alien warrior?) ends up finding her - for quite a while, he assumes she is a teenage boy. She doesn&#39;t speak their language so they try their best to communicate by other means. The MMC has brothers/friends? I believe 2 of them and there is another brother that is deemed evil and who stays away from the rest of them. There are also other aliens however, they don&#39;t bother them. There are NO female aliens and no one to reproduce with so when it&#39;s found out that she is a female, all men who know are trying to seek her out for themselves. She also initially travelled over with a female colleague, however she gets separat
