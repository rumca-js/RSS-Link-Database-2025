I responded to a post reaching out to people in this situation, replying to someone who said Americans are to blame for this.

Well I guess someone reported me for that and now my account has been given a warning from Reddit for threatening physical violence???? I did no such thing. This is some hardcore censorship.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: we argued about how bathrooms and sports are being exaggerated and disrespected, then he said that &quot;if he&#39;s a guy and want to give birth, it can&#39;t happen&quot; 10 minutes later I share three articles online about the prospects of uterine transplant and pregnancy, and he&#39;s refusing to listen.</p> <p>So at the start of all this we discussed how bathrooms and showers were (I don&#39;t think so) a major issue involving trans individuals. He believes that a transperson entering &quot;the opposite bathrooms&quot; would draw too much attention and cause people to cat call and harass them. He said if it happened he didn&#39;t want to stand up for someone else. I asked why when he would if it was anywhere else, and that if people defend and respect each other then it wouldn&#39;t be a problem. </p> <p>He sidesteps to say that &quot;these people were given their chance to fail, and that now we are stopping it to help them&quot; excuse me

## Transphobia is so tiring‚Ä¶

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm so sick of the idea that trans people were forced into being trans? 12 year old me definitely wasn‚Äôt forced to look up male puberty on my free time &amp; then cry about the fact that I wasn‚Äôt born male, I also wasn‚Äôt forced into playing house with other boys my age as a kid &amp; telling them we should be 2 men &amp; instead of a man &amp; a women. Transphobes can call me being born a female &amp; calling myself a man/male delusional all they want, call if whatever tf you want, but I surly did not choose to have these feelings. You have to be actually insane to think someone would choose to be trans when in my situation i already have to deal with hardship being black &amp; dont get me started on the anti queerness in the black community &amp; the racism in the queer community like yes I truly do choose to have less people understand me even people within my own community, all the community‚Äôs I‚Äôm in at that. Being trans is hell, every waking mome
