<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I can&#39;t decide between Vivaldi or Edge.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for an alternative to Chrome and Firefox, and I don&#39;t like how Brave pushes crypto onto you, so I have narrowed it down to Edge and Vivaldi.</p> <p>I know Edge is as bad as Chrome, if not worse, when it comes to privacy, but it seems most browsers have sold out nowadays. I like how snappy and fast it is. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything special, but a fine browser if you just want a browser that works. I also kinda got fed up with Chrome&#39;s stability issues.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t noticed much of a difference in speed between Edge and Vivaldi except when it comes to start up. Vivaldi takes a little longer than Edge, but once it gets going, I haven&#39;t noticed a difference in speed for loading pages. I always like the high customization Vivaldi offers. I want to like Opera, but it&#39;s owned by a Chinese company, so Vivaldi is the next best thing. I like that i

## Edge refuses to load a page for five-ish minutes, then is fine

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only seen this for a few weeks now and it&#39;s hard as hell to replicate. Edge will start randomly NOT loading a page for a good five minutes. It isn&#39;t the same page and it&#39;s not, afaik, DNS, as I can see the behavior on localhost as well. I&#39;ll see the tab sit there for 5 or so minutes and then it loads. After that, it&#39;s fine as well.</p> <p>What&#39;s odd is that it is only one profile. If I switch to another profile, or use incognito mode, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;ve disabled _all_ extensions and it hasn&#39;t helped. For a site where this happens, I&#39;ve also tried clearing my cache as well just to ensure it&#39;s not something crazy there.</p> <p>I know this is kind of vague, but has anyone seen anything like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cfjedimaster"> /u/cfjedimaster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1j2vk8a/edge_refuses_to_

I have installed Opera on three laptops using the same Opera account. On two of them sync works as expected, but on the third sync refuses to work. The sync button under my profile shows that sync is turned off even though the options are turned on when you click on it. Also, if I go to <a href="http://sync.opera.com">sync.opera.com</a> on that machine I can&#39;t see my synced items. That site works fine on the other laptops. The faulty laptop is only a couple of months old. FWIW, I do have NordVPN installed on that laptop and I&#39;ve tried disabling it with no improvement on the sync functionality but there could be something about its presence that is causing an issue. I appreciate any advice on the issue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/djolord"> /u/djolord </a> <br/> <span><a hre

Currently, all of the browsers with this feature I&#39;ve tried (Vivaldi, Floorp, Zen, and Edge) do what I&#39;d call tab &quot;grouping&quot; where you can display n tabs in a single view. This misses the most important part of split-based navigation in that the user can pop in/out pages they want from their buffers.</p> <p>I am probably not describing myself well.
