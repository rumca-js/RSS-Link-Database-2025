        "description": "Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive releases internationally on March 20th, just 10 years after its original Wii U launch. Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive is wrapped in a slew of new convenience features and upgraded visuals. But that\u2019s not all, there\u2019s even some additional story tidbits for fans to look forward to.\n\nDespite how vast and intricate this game\u2019s systems and open world are, the numerous quality of life adjustments added to this remaster might make Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition one of the more approachable titles in the genre.",

        "description": "Exploration is something that every open world game banks on heavily, but nailing that aspect is far easier said than done. As a franchise, Assassin\u2019s Creed has usually prided itself on consistently delivering incredibly crafted and immaculately detailed period settings that are begging to be explored, and the upcoming Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is seemingly not going to buck that trend by any means. \n\nIn fact, if anything, it\u2019s promising to be one of the series\u2019 stronger outings in the exploration department. Not only is the upcoming action RPG promising to deliver a gorgeous Sengoku era Japanese setting, it\u2019s also making changes to exploration, traversal, and more that can elevate the experience in several ways- if done right. Thankfully, there\u2019s reason to be optimistic that they will be.",
