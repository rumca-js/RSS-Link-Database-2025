The biggest victory of Russell Henley\u2019s career arrived as Collin Morikawa was left to ponder how on earth he failed to close out the Arnold Palmer Invitational. For much of Sunday, Morikawa had looked untouchable.</p><p>Henley took to the 71st tee of the event holding the lead for the first time. He had claimed that with an astonishing chip in for an eagle on the 16th. This completed a four-shot swing in only three holes. Henley birdied the 14th as Morikawa bogeyed. After Henley\u2019s exploits two holes later, Morikawa had no scope for recovery. Henley\u2019s 11 under par took the Bay Hill tournament by a single stroke. He had trailed Morikawa by three after 10 fourth-round holes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/09/morikawa-stunned-as-russell-henley-wins-arnold-palmer-invitational\"",

The 2025 festival will be the 10th anniversary of the last season when British trainers saddled more winners at the meeting than their Irish counterparts and Ireland is no bigger than 1-9 to extend its winning streak into a second decade.</p><p>As an annual celebration of Irish culture and achievement on foreign soil, the Cheltenham festival now feels inked into the calendar as firmly as the St Patrick\u2019s Day parade in New York. Yet it is a situation that would have seemed unthinkable at the turn of the century, when Ireland\u2019s return of three wins at what was then a 19-race festival was pretty much par for the course.</p> <a href=\"http",

Patients were convinced that their symptoms had something to do with the deer that roamed the nearby woods and the ticks they frequently found clinging to their clothes. But because the symptoms were so ill-defined and there was no treatment, physicians dismissed the symptoms as psychosomatic.</p><p>Then in 1975, alarmed by the exceptionally high rates of juvenile arthritis in Lyme, the Connecticut health department decided to investigate. It took seven years but eventually, in 1982, they identified a spiral-shaped bacterium in the midgut of deer ticks that was also present in the blood of sick people. All it took to spark the disorder was for an infected tick to latch on to an unsuspecting victim and inject the bacterium u",

Fragrances are increasingly amalgamating heavier ingredients with lighter ones to work across the seasons, so the advice holds less water. A decent oud with rose scent, for instance, can work beautifully in summer or winter. Right now, however, for reasons inexplicable to myself, how I want to smell is shifting into nature, specifically the kind you find in a garden \u2013 a fruit and vegetable garden to be precise.

If you have it, you take it for granted,\u2019 reports Wendy Cooper in the <em>Observer Magazine</em> on 24 January 1971. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s rhythmic rocking or counting sheep for you, though not for Charles Dickens: he made sure his bed faced north, better to boost his creativity as he slumbered.</p><p>We spend a third of our lives sleeping, but some feel they still don\u2019t get enough, some (narcoleptics) fall asleep when they eat. Some sleepwalk or, in one case, sleepride their motorbike in the middle of the night.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/09/opening-our-eyes-to-the-science-of-sleep-in-1971\">Continue reading...</a>",

After all, 26 years is quite a long time. The impressive young woman managing the restaurant today wasn\u2019t even born when I came the first time. Back then, I wrote that it was decorated in calming shades of sandstone and noted a little decorative ironwork. Now the walls are a White Company shade of cream and there\u2019s a mural of an Indian vista. It\u2019s a comfortable, if functional, space. What matters is the extremely good value vegetarian Indian food, which I loved then and adore now.</p> <a href",

The statements he has made, and continues to make, about Gaza, Greenland, Panama and Canada should be taken literally.
