Your task is simple yet nerve-wracking: spot the anomalies that appear in your environment. When you notice something has changed, retreat to the entrance. When everything seems normal, proceed to the exit. But be careful - only 10 correct predictions in a row will set you free.</p> <p><strong>What Lurks in the Corridor?</strong> BACKROOMS ANOMALY plays with your sense of reality. Every run through the corridor might reveal new changes - a misplaced poster, shifted furniture, or something more unsettling. As you progress, the pressure builds, knowing that one wrong move will reset your escape counter back to zero.</p> <p><a href=\"https://liminal-space-dev.itch.io/backrooms-anomaly\"><strong>Play now",

The plan all along was to create a highly addictive environment where people without any background can learn quantum the same way you learn the name of the fish you catch in Subnautica. It feels like a Zachtronics game and is as complex as Turing Complete. The reviews are excellent so far and we are growing our community on Discord.</p> <p>I&#39;m bad at marketing, sorry if I don&#39;t do it justice. Check our Steam page for more and why not go and buy it. Your $ goes into supporting this unique project grow, we are pretty bootstrapped rn.
