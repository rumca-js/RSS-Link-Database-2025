If I want to add an AI Hat (either 13 or 26 TOPS version), would I need to buy a different camera like the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 or 3? Or since my current camera is also manufactured by Raspberry Pi, will it work without any problems with the AI Hat? Thanks in advance.</p> <p>Edit: How much power (watts) does the Raspberry Pi AI Hat consume - both 13 TOPS and 26 TOPS versions? I&#39;m planning to also use a UPS HAT, so I need to understand the total power requirements for my setup. And there is no information on raspbery website.
