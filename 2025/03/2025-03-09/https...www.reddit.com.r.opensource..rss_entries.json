I was thinking how can we make the syntaxes more human-readable. So i created a python wrapper which has syntaxes like sql+python. Shout out to one of the community members that got the ball rolling. </p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Built on top of jq for speed and flexibility. Instead of wrestling with some syntax thats really hard to manipulate, I thought maybe just combine python and sql syntaxes and wrap it around JQ. </p> <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>SQL-Like Queries</strong>: Write select field1, field2 if condition to grab and filter data.</li> <li><strong>Aggregations</strong>: Built-in functions like sum(), avg(), count(), max(), and min() (Will expand it if i have more use cases on my end or if anyone wants more features)</li> <li><strong>Nested Data Made Simple</strong>: Traverse nested json",
