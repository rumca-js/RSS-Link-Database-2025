The program is legitimately therapeutic. Of course it\u2019s not like real life, I\u2019m not ACTUALLY there, but by god is it the closest you can get. </p> <p>It\u2019s just fun to zoom around and find random things. I\u2019ve spend hours just zooming around Arizona and Nevada looking at all the random things in the desert. Finding random street views in the middle of forests. Even have opened WebSDR and zoomed around until I\u2019ve found a radio frequency on a billboard or rooftop or something, and have tuned into it.
