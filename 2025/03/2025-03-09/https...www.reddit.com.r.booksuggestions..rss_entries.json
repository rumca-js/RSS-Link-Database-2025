I loved its style, the &quot;drama&quot; was quickly solved with communication and the focus is the internal conflicts of the characters. The romance between the main characters is strong because it keeps the story together but is very slow: they need to overcome their problems because they affect their coming together.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for a novel which has that same feel. Not with teens, though. I&#39;m 21 years old, I want sth more mature. College maybe. </p> <p>Friends to lovers, Slice of Life, Romance is a must!!!

I like reading memoirs and I think that would be something he would enjoy but I want us to have a wide variety of authors and genres to read and hopefully we can keep a habit and devour books.</p> <p>I also know he like mysteries so those and thrillers might be a good start.

I\u2019ve been thinking about how hardships and struggles in life aren\u2019t just obstacles, but actually signs guiding us toward a breakthrough. The idea that challenges don\u2019t happen to punish us, but to redirect us, to help us grow, and to steer us away from the wrong path really resonates with me.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to read books\u2014whether from psychology, philosophy, spirituality, or even esoteric perspectives\u2014that explore this concept. Books that explain how life &quot;communicates&quot; with us through difficulties and how we can reframe these moments as opportunities for transformation.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations, I\u2019d really appreciate it.

They were just on my list, no particular intent there, but they kinda went together more than I expected when it came to the real and unreal. But now I&#39;m wanting more of this real/unreal in a specific way. I&#39;m tired of people in real life who have no concept of self-honesty and my own little personal journey lately has been about that too. </p> <p>So, any fiction (any genre, really!) where the author just really puts it into perfect words, or demonstrates beautifully how people self-deceive? Small consequences, big consequences...anything is good. </p> </div><!-- S",
