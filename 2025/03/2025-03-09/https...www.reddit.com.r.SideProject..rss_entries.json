Looking for a bit of a reality check on a side project idea I&#39;m kicking around.</p> <p>The basic idea is: build a service where users give daily story snippets to a bot (end of day reflections, etc.). Then, using an LLM, have the AI create social media posts <em>as</em> that user, based on those stories. Think daily posts, maybe like a blog or quick social updates. User gets to see the &quot;AI-generated persona&quot; after a while.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking Python, some LLM API (OpenAI, maybe?), and figuring out the social media API part (Reddit, maybe others later?).</p> <p>Question for you side-project gurus: Does this sound like a manageable side project? Am I biting off more than I can chew? Any advice on tech stack, potential pitfalls, or even if this idea is just plain dumb? \ud83d\ude02 Any feedback appreciated!
