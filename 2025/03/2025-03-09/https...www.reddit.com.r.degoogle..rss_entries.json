I have tried maps.me, but it shows me really weird ways to ride with the car. When I wanted to go to the grocery store, I wanted to walk and it advised me to walk on the highway. So I deleted it and it wasn&#39;t a great option. For now I am using OpenStreetMap, but it doesn&#39;t feel comfortable because it is very very slow. When I want to drive from A to B, it takes 5 to 10 minutes (I clocked it) to show me 1 way, instead of 3 options and yes it was a very strange route from what I always drove in the past (it was a test, didn&#39;t have to use it). </p> <p>For a little information, I live in the Netherlands and I drive all across in Europe. I go to a lot of continents, so I would want an alternative for the whole world what is not Google. I feel like there is no other option than Google, but I could be wrong (I hope so). Please help. </p> </di",

I&#39;m looking for an Android OS alternative for my phone, my objective is to have a OS that doesn&#39;t use Google services and that is also secure and respects privacy. For what I&#39;ve seen, Graphene OS is the best option, but I don&#39;t have a Pixel phone. I know Ubuntu Tuch has many security flaws and it is not maintained. And Lineage OS which was my second option (after Graphene) uses many Google services... I&#39;ve heard also about /e/ OS and Calix, but I don&#39;t know the specific details. If anyone has any recommendation and the reasons why to pick a specific OS I&#39;ll be very interested to hear. Take into account that the phones I have to install the OS are a Redmi one and a Samsung. EDIT: Many people have recommended /e/ and Lineage OS, any recommendation between these two is welcome</p> </d",
