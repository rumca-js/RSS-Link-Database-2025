For a variety of reasons both my own life and the world at large.</p> <p>And I&#39;m wondering who your go-to series/books/authors for books that get you out of a funk. For me, I&#39;d love something where the heroes beat the bad guys, overcome the odds, but not so much that it&#39;s saccharine. </p> <p>One author I&#39;m looking at and have read very little by, is Terry Pratchett. I know he was a kind, funny and insightful person. My question is, does the comedy overshadow the story? Or do you get invested in the characters and their journey as well? If so, where ought I start? </p> <p>One last question. Where do you look for recommendations? Other than here? There was a time when you could actually find good suggestions on Amazon. But now.....It&#39;s the same few author and series. You can&#39;t scan the virtual bookshelves like you once could.</p> <p>Thanks all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",

I&#39;m looking for it to either be Sci-Fi, Fantasy, or Historical Fiction. It has to be a stand alone novel (or be able to stand alone), and ~400 pages in length. The most difficult part for me, however, is that I have to have not read the book. Therefore, a lot of popular standalones (Lions of Al-Rassan, the Sanderson standalones), and books that are able to standalone (Small Gods, Guards! Guards!, and Monstrous Regiment notably) are books I can&#39;t choose.

It also helps that this is by far the fastest-paced entry in the series.</p> <p>I started the book on Wednesday, finished it last night, and now, at last, I can sit down to share my thoughts. So, how did this one hold up? Honestly, it\u2019s a fantastic conclusion to the original trilogy while laying the groundwork for the new series. As always, I won\u2019t spoil anything major, but be warned\u2014this review will touch on the ending of <em>To Green Angel Tower</em>, so if you\u2019re planning to read the original trilogy first, keep that in mind.</p> <p>And, of course, for those who just wa",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! I&#39;d like to dive deeper into fantasy, and I&#39;d be super grateful for recommendations. I&#39;m only familiar with the basics: I&#39;m from the Harry Potter generation. I read GRRM, Tolkien, Pratchett, and some Le Guin. Plus Sapkowski, and a bunch of other Polish authors.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something with strong characters. It doesn&#39;t need to be character-driven, but the characters can&#39;t feel flat. Leaning slightly toward high fantasy but not fixated on that. I&#39;d rather start with something that isn&#39;t super long and not too heartbreaking. Bonus points for an elemental magic system and for the main character who is a witch/wizard/otherwise very involved in doing magic (as opposed to just playing a different part in a world with magic) -- neither is a must though. </p> <p>I know it&#39;s broad, but I&#39;m not sure where I want to go yet. Thank you in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
