I was never a big fan of board games because I don&#39;t have the patience when learning the rules and setting up takes longer than the actual game. Recently, I got to try Cubitos and The Quacks of Quedlinburg with a group of friends, and I enjoyed it. I really like the push-your-luck and bag-building mechanics, especially in games that are easy to learn but still strategic.

These games look too be high quality, with increadible depth, and a strong theme. </p> <p>I love that GMT games gave these to the convention to support a smallisg gaming group. You guys rock! </p> <p>I am just not sure if these are the games for me... But at least one may be, so i came here for help. </p> <p>I&#39;m a dad of 3 kids 6,11,14 so game time is limited, but much less so if they play with me. For context, the 6 and 11 year old just spent 9 hours over 3 days playing the new elder scrolls game and we regularly play too many bones... They so adore it. I think the theme and progression grab them. After that we play games like camel up and castle panic, mechs vs minions, and clank.</p> <p>My wife and i host a biweekly ",

I don&#39;t wanna waste like 80 bucks on a game I won&#39;t end up liking. Anyway I decided on Malaya, cuz that seems like the most interesting one to me, and was wondering if anyone knows where a list of the event cards and their effects for Malaya, or if they have the game themselves if they&#39;d be willing to send me just the card description. Thx in advance.</p> <p>Edit: I was just looking for a way to try the COIN series before buying one, and making one seemed like the easiest way to do it.
