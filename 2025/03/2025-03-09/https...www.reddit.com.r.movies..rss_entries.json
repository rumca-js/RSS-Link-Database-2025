They excel at transforming into a wide range of characters, sometimes disappearing so fully into their roles that audiences may recognize their face but not their name. Unlike traditional leading actors, who may rely on star power or charisma, character actors are typically known for their versatility, ability to inhabit specific personas, and scene-stealing performances.</p> <p>For example, Richard Jenkins is one of my favorites. Most people probably know him as the dad from Step Brothers, but he&#39;s been in tons of things and elevates movies in just about any genre even with a very small role.</p> <p><em>Responses may make Monday&#39;s episode of Force Five</em>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/forcefivepod\"> /u",

Avoiding spoilers and not knowing any scenes is a bonus.</p> <p>Most of the time I don&#39;t even read synopsis, i always go blind into the movies now (of course if it&#39;s not known widely what it is about) and it&#39;s been great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/A",

It\u2019s about a former prostitute who now works at a food stall (bento stall) and it kinda revolves around topics like loneliness and such. Im a happy teenager, so I couldn\u2019t connect too well with that aspect of the movie, but I loved the main actress, Kasumi Arimura. She\u2019s one of my fav actresses of all time now. The role she played in this movie was so different from the one I first saw her in, it honestly left me wondering if it was the same person, she did a really good job. Another thing to appreciate is the cinematography, the movie looks really pretty, and kind of reminded me of a Wes Anderson style due to its bright colours and saturation. It also kinda made me happy for some reason (apart from the sad scenes ofc). The only thing I think some ppl might have",
