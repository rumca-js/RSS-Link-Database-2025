I did this and opened it to the internet. But in the few weeks I left it open ids/ips was going insane(I had a netgear router that had the armor subscription and it would detect and block anything coming in) so I closed it thinking there was most likely a better (and more importantly more secure) way to do it. Then I stumbled upon Cloudflare tunnels, this seemed to be the magic bullet to my problems, I open a tunnel and just host through there and it would be secure.

My current setup is a small Ubuntu VPS (1vCPU, 1GB ram) from Vultr. When I installed Portainer on the VPS, it freaked me out a bit because the WebUI can be accessed at the VPS&#39;s IP:9443. Does it mean anyone who happens across my VPS public IP can give it a crack and brute force the login? I already installed UFW and tried to deny all incoming but somehow Portainer slipped through.

You can do the following and have a fully functional Supabase instance in probably under 20 minutes. This is for people who what to have all that Supabase offers for only the cost of the server or for those who want to reduce latency by having their instance in a region that the hosted version is not close to. With this guide, it will be a breeze to set it up and have it function exactly the same. In this example, I am using Coolify to self host Supabase.</p> <p><strong>How to Self Host Supabase in Coolify</strong></p> <p>To install Supabase in Coolify, first create the server in Coolify. Then start it so it becomes available.</p> <p>In Coolify, add a resource and look for Supabase.</p> <p>Now it is time to change the docker compose file and the settings in Coolify.</p> <p>For the docker file, copy and paste the following <stron",

I&#39;m using JellyFin on my Windows Laptop to my Android TV (onn. TV Pro 4K).</p> <p>The server was discoverable but wouldn&#39;t let me in. It was turned on, but still wouldn&#39;t let me in. Strange.<br/> I uninstalled Jellyfin server and was going to re-install it to see if that worked; but I noticed NOW there&#39;s a new update to JellyFin that screws the pooch on some people. I thought I forgot where I was going, but, NO, it&#39;s JELLYFIN&#39;s DOING? (Sacr\u00e9 Bleu???)</p> <p>I go to install the JellyFin server on Windows, the repo page gives me either to install on AMD or ARM. Here&#39;s the thing; this is kind of a crappy laptop and it uses Intel-R. So; neither ARM or AMD.</p> <p>So....is JellyFin OUT as an option? Or is there still a way to install it?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

I have re-purposed a old laptop into a server for me and my friends but it&#39;s has its limitations and it has started to get pretty warm even with the fans at 100%. Main games that it will be hosted for Modded minecraft and BeamNG drive an whatever else we decide on playing. I have a pretty beefy gaming computer and know that modded minecraft is mainly cpu and ram intensive so I plan on having 32-64gbs of ram and was thinking 6-8 cores. I&#39;m looking to do it somewhat on a budget maybe buying a pre-built on ebay and upgrading the ram.
