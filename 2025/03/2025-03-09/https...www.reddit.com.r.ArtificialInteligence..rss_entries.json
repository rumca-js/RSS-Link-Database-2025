I refine a research question using ChatGPT, then feed it into Deep Research and listen to the output using ElevenLabs text-to-speech Reader, essentially treating it like a personalized podcast. I research topics that interest me, like the 2003 Iraq War or the survival of traditional African religions in Benin Republic. </p> <p>Initially, I checked the citations, and they seemed solid. But since this is AI-generated content, I know mistakes are inevitable. My concern is whether I might be absorbing hallucinated information since I am treating the outputs like a podcast and don\u2019t do extensive fact-checking.</p> <p>So, on a scale of 1 to 100, how accurate and reliable would you say Deep Research is for this kind of use case? What are its biggest weaknesses? Is it safe to rely on for general knowledge? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Uc",

Or will no-code/low-code solutions make developers less relevant?</p> <p>For those already in the field, how are you future-proofing your skills? Are there specific technologies (AI, Web3, cybersecurity, etc.) that you think will dominate the future of web dev?</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ArgumentInside4990\"> /u/ArgumentInside4990 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1j6vfkl/is_learning_web_development_still_worth_it_will/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",

I could be.</p> <p>And so, I have already stated that we are far, far, FAR from AGI, despite what all the hype says. I also stated that von Neumann (and related existing) architectures will not scale to AGI. It&#39;s the von Neumann bottleneck that is inherent in the design. </p> <p>To get your mind around the nature of the problem, our computers today come with many gigabytes of RAM. At the high-end, you have terabytes of it.</p> <p>But how much of that RAM the CPU can access <em>simultaneously</em>? A billion bytes? A megabyte? A kilobyte? Nope. At most, 8 bytes at a time, and you are free to multiply that by the number of lanes your computer has. So, at best, 8 bytes * 16 lanes = 128 bytes, and in bits, that&#39;s 1024.</p> <p>Each neuron in your brain, on the other hand, have upwards of 100,000 &quot;bit&quot; connections (synapses) to thousands of other neurons. We simply have no analog of that level ",
