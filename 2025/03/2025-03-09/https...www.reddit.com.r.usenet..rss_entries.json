It won&#39;t let me initiate a new cancellation request because it says I have an existing one, and when I created a ticket to get help it said it did but the link says the ticket doesn&#39;t exist.</p> <p>I have tried emailing them, calling them, messaging them on Facebook, and even PM&#39;ing <a href=\"/u/Thunder_Cube\">/u/Thunder_Cube</a> but <em>no one</em> is responding.
