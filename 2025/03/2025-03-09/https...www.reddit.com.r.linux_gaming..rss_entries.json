If, however, i boot up the pc and let it sit for a good while, say an hour, before i go play the games suddenly run really poorly, like sub-15 fps poorly. What gives? htop shows the game as using damn near 100% of my cpu. If i reboot the pc, the issue goes away, again provided i play somewhat immediately after reboot. </p> <p>I&#39;m on Fedora 41 Workstation, Using gnome on wayland.

I can run it just fine with Proton, but when I hit F6 the window size changes but the game size not if that makes any sense and when I use alt + enter it does rescale but it freaks out a little as in once the screen changes it old one becomes an overlay, hiding the actual game when a lot changes and when something minor like the rim around a menu selection changes it switches between the two displays rapidly as if it&#39;s trying to display both the real and the previous one at once. I already tried changing my Proton version (I tried the Hotfix, Proton Experimental, 9.0 and 8.0) and changing my display settings. I&#39;m also thinking of maybe using a VM instead but VirtualBox just sucks for gaming.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently I have switched to a linux based gaming system for more optimized fps in most of my games. The specific distro being Pika OS. However, when trying to launch minecraft 1.8.9 with forge, as I play Hypixel Skyblock, with the normal minecraft launcher or with Badlion Client launcher, it seems to randomly crash and all it gives me is &quot;Exit Code: 6&quot;. The only thing that works is Lunar client and that doesn&#39;t have what I am looking for in Skyblock. Seemingly any newer versions work including 1.21.4 and just 1.9. I have zero idea on why this is happening and can&#39;t find anything that works online. So i am reaching out here to hopefully find and answer and be able to play minecraft again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NinjaKnight64\"> /u/NinjaKnight64 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j79xh4/minecraft_forge_189_crashing/\">[link]</a></span>",

I just want to browse web and play some retro games (2005 and before) with it. Only game i can run properly with it was Soldier of Fortune. GTA San Andreas and Vice City&#39;s didn&#39;t load properly (It was just a black box with some white triangles), TMNT(2003) had similar problem. Freedom Fighters, Half Life 2 had lower FPS for thi\u015f hardware. Marc Ecko&#39;s Getting Up gave an error and refuse to launch. My software is all updated and upgraded, i tried with Lutris and Bottles. I am using Q4OS (Debian 12)</p> <p>P.S: If linuxgaming of today can&#39;t run era appropriate games for 10 year hardware, are we sure it can handle games of today with todays hardware ten years in the future? I am really fond of linux and this can make a proper test of how future-proof linux gaming really is.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UmutsuzSecmen\">",
