I recently bought the Seagate Expansion 24tb external drive from Best Buy for $279. I currently only have a Dell Optiplex acting as a server for the usual stuff.</p> <p>Curious what are the pros and cons of chucking? Should I chuck before/after the warranty on the Seagate drive? Some concerns (not sure how accurate these are) are that I will void the warranty once I shuck so it brings up a question of whether I should shuck now or wait until the warranty expires. Another concern is that I might break my drive in the process. Any advice and tips would be appreciated!
