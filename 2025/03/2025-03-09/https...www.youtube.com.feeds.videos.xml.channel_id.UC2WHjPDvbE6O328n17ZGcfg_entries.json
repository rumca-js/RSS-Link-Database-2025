This video is the planning phase of how I think I want my office. I'm open to hearing what y'all think and any ideas you may have. I've got two Cat6 running through, so many outlets its split on two circuits, and right now it's just an open canvas. It'll be carpeted, of course, since that's just cozier and provides some solid noise dampening. I need those good acoustics. \n\nWhat I'll be doing in this office is coding, recording videos from multiple angles, chilling, gaming, reading, writing, and who knows what else - maybe streaming. The d\u00e9cor will include a lot of old duck decoys, some art, and maybe my deer head or pair of stuffed wood ducks - not sure yet.
