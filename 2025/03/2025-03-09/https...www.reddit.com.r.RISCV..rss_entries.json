I&#39;m also going to guess because they will be part of the AURIX product range that they should be multicore devices, that they should support lockstep, and that they will be compliant with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262\">ISO 26262</a> (Typically required for use in Engine and Transmission controller units). All of the current AURIX product range are 32-bit devices, which may (or might not), mean that this new microcontroller might also be a 32-bit device?</p> <p>Manufacturers of cars, lorries and drones appear to be their current target customers.</p> <p>ref: </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2025/INFATV202",
