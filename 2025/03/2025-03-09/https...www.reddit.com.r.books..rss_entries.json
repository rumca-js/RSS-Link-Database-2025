For everyone on the planet has become a vampire, who are also very hungry and are out for Neville&#39;s blood.</p> <p>During the day he hunts them all through the ruins of civilization. And by night, he barricades himself within his home where he prays for the dawn to come. Who can survive in a world populated by vampires?</p> <p>Really enjoyed this one, especially with Matheson&#39;s take on vampires. Here the vampires are the result of a plague, basically a zombie apocalypse. I always like stories that have a twist to them, and Matheson gave his twist to the vampire story.</p> <p>The thought of going through the danger of a hostile apocalyptic world would certainly bring intense mental turmoil, especially if you&#39;re the last",
