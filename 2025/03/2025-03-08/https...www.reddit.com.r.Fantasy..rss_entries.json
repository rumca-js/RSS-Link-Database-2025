I have read several of these series and they are my favourite genre, but sometimes they can be complicated by name dropping several locations on one page, magic systems and spells, new names, etc., and you need to refer back to annexes or maps. How do you read through these novels while keeping all these pieces in mind? Do you print maps? Take notes?

A few books I have loved include Red Rising and Kings of Paradise. I have already read the majority of popular books in this genre, and would really appreciate some slightly more obscure titles. I enjoy both more futuristic and medieval or older books, but prefer to have them a little removed from current day. </p> <p>Quick note on the epic bit of the title, I love a story which comprehensively follows someone&#39;s journey to power or societal change. I find most in this genre to make the books either a smidge dreary in places, or hop around to different characters, while I like to focus on a single character and fully get to know them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chronurgy\"> /u/Chronurgy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/com",

My bet is on William Hope Hodgeson, a pre-Tolkien writer who had a big influence on the genre. He grew up as an apprentice sailor and saw a lot of things during his voyages. He was also relentlessly bullied by other boys for being short and having a feminine pretty face. To defend himself, he fanatically trained his body until eventually he became one of the strongest men in England. He even wrote articles about P.E, opened a school for P.E, trained policemen and did stunts with Harry Houdini. </p> <p>When WW1 broke out, he immediately entered it and was a brave soldier who returned to war even when he could leave it after injury.

I know what\u2019s considered \u201cclassic\u201d can be subjective so I\u2019ll try to specify what I\u2019m looking for! </p> <p>A story about a person of humble beginnings finding out they have magical powers or a destiny of some kind. Maybe they set out on a quest to \u201csave the world\u201d or to find out more about this new part of themselves. As much as I like complex magic systems (aka Stormlight and such) I really miss the mystical feel of Tolkien, GRRM and Robert Jordan. Dragons and other mystical creatures are always appreciated and a fight against a great evil never fails either.</p> <p>The story doesn\u2019t have to follow what I\u2019ve written above, it\u2019s more of an outline of what I\u2019m looking for. What\u2019s most important is that the book was released within the last 15 years or so.</p> <p>Thanks to you all in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

Ahora estoy un poco indeciso sobre qu\u00e9 leer a continuaci\u00f3n. Me recomendaron seguir explorando el Cosmere y seguir el orden de <em>Elantris</em>, <em>Mistborn 2</em>, <em>Warbreaker</em> y <em>El Archivo de Tormentas</em>, pero tambi\u00e9n me est\u00e1n tentando la trilog\u00eda de <em>La Cr\u00f3nica del Asesino de Reyes</em> de Patrick Rothfuss y la famosa saga de <em>La Rueda del Tiempo</em>.</p> <p>Me encanta la literatura fant\u00e1stica, as\u00ed que me gustar\u00eda saber cu\u00e1les han sido sus experiencias o recomendaciones. \u00bfCreen que vale la pena seguir con el Cosmere o deber\u00eda sumergirme en <em>La Cr\u00f3nica del Asesino de Reyes</em> o <em>La Rueda del Tiempo</em>?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Significant-Ground41\"> /u/Significant-Ground41 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

My co-host and I had been talking in earlier episodes about the distinction between fantasy and science fiction (I\u2019m of the opinion that there really doesn\u2019t need to be one, but I digress). My most recent perusing of An Atlas Of Fantasy made me realize how much fantasy is a genre that leans heavily on maps.
