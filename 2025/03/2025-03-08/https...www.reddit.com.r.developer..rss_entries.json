I do not have a CS degree but have 5 years as a QA in the industry and wanted to branch out. </p> <p>So I am looking for some advice on whether bootcamps will improve my chances.</p> <p>I am trying to build my github portfolio with projects but am having trouble getting interviews. So I am considering the bootcamp route to expand my network but they are going to get me to do the same thing I am doing now. I am focusing on web development mostly. I don&#39;t consider myself a good or even decent programmer. I hit my head on leetcode for their javascript challenges.</p> <p>So, does anyone have any advice or suggestions....I am 32 right now and I don&#39;t want to get 4 year degree and pay loans. </p> <p>I am in Canada and we have grants for micro-credentials so it will be covered by the government for those looking for a second career.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
