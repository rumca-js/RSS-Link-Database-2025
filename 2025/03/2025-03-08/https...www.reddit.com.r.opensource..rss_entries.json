Trees, graphs, linked lists\u2026 they all made sense in theory, but I wanted something more visual. So, I built an <strong>interactive web app</strong> that lets you play around with different data structures, see animations of operations in real time, and get explanations of their time complexity and use cases.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019m making it <strong>open source</strong> so others can learn from it, improve it, and contribute! If you\u2019re into <strong>Next.js, data structures, or just love open-source projects</strong>, feel free to check it out.

I&#39;m thiking of downloading all those photos on my local storage and then using some sort of tool to delete those blurry, duplicates... also I&#39;m looking for something that would automatically sort my photos to food, nature, building etc. This way it will be easier for me to choose which ones I need to delete. Then after doing that I&#39;m thinking of backup up as usal but this time I want to try something else other than google photos. Please suggest me something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Strange-Series-5510\"> /u/Strange-Series-5510 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
