I&#39;ve been wondering, if I&#39;ve downloaded a torrent file of a game (then used deluge to start it), and plan on deleting it later after playing it, will I get in trouble? I live in Poland and am not too sure how it works tbh, I checked it and some people say that it&#39;s only safe to torrent movies, other say that if it is not a polish production, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just confused atp.. and I don&#39;t currently use any VPNs.
