Meaning, if you break a magnet in half, both of those halves will also have two poles. But some physicists think that particles with just one magnetic pole might exist \u2013 these theoretical particles are called monopoles. However, up until now, theories have shown that the existence of monopoles would cause a paradox by breaking up indivisible particles. Now, a group of physicists have published a new paper explaining that paradox, and monopoles might be back on the menu. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.051602\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcr",
