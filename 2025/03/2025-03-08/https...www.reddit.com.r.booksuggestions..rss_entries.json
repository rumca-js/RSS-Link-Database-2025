I rarely post but i wanted to ask. I recently finished reading Hamlet prince of Denmark (It was a for school.) and I found out i actually really liked reading it and i wondered what sort of book would you reccomend? I read Antigone also for school and i liked that too (except the incest parts but ig that was normal for their time). Im going to go get a library card sometime next week and i would love to get some reccs. I think i would enjoy some dramatic works (or plays im sorry i dont know the word for it) similar to these but i have no idea what to look for. Any advice will be appreciated :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kasumifan\"> /u/Kasumifan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j6rsmy/what_should/\">[link]</a></",

The best description of what I&#39;ve spent the last years searching for goes something like this. I want the book to have soft romance, not a sparks fly and a raging inferno lights in my heart romance. I want to find the subtle, slow build, the falling in love with her smile, her laugh, that way her nose scrunches in frustration. The kind that feels like a warm winter night wrapped in blankets sitting next to a gentle fireplace, sipping hot chocolate and enjoying each others presence.
