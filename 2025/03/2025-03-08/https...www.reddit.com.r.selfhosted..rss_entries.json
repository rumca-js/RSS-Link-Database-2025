I self-host a Headscale server on this cluster to reduce latency. My goal is to access my gaming PC (which has Sunshine installed) via Moonlight remotely, using Tailscale. I also want my RPi to act as the exit node so I can use Chiaki to play my PS5 remotely.</p> <p>The issue: whenever I configure Tailscale on my RPi, my apps running on the Kubernetes cluster become unreachable. My cluster is set up with Nginx and Cert-manager for Let&#39;s Encrypt, and most apps are exposed via Ingress to the internet. Ideally, I&#39;d like to run Tailscale under Kubernetes to integrate it better.</p> <p>Has anyone tackled a similar setup? How can I configure Tailscale as an exit node without breaking my ingress traffic?

One is in my private vlan where Authentik is hosted and the other is in a DMZ which has only LAN-&gt;DMZ traffic allowed. I usually have not had any issues in the past logging to the portainer in DMZ since PfSense is a stateful firewall. </p> <p>With Authentik, when I log in to the portainer instance on my LAN, everything is fine. However, when logging in to Portainer in DMZ, it is stuck on Authentication in progress and errors out after a minute. I verified that the LAN-&gt;DMZ is the issue by disabling the traffic disallow rule from DMZ-&gt;LAN.</p> <p>I really dont want to disable that rule that blocks traffic since that is the whole point of a DMZ. Any ideas on what I can do here? Any configuration changes I might need to make or install it differently altogether? </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.

Tracking which proxies are used for which sites quickly becomes messy. I\u2019ve been imagining a central repository of proxies (for example, BrightData) that acts as a single source of truth. If I ever need to change authentication details or update a particular proxy, I could do it in one place rather than editing every individual scraper.</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a self-hosted tool\u2014something akin to Prowlarr\u2014that can manage and route requests across your own set of proxies. Another comparison might be an AI prompt router. Essentially, I\u2019d love to just send a request to a service, and have it decide which proxy to use (e.g., round-robin style, or selecting the right proxy for a site needing JavaScript support).
