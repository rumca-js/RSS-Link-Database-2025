I found someone selling a bundle of the original Atari 2600 and a bunch of games, including Mountain King! I thought it would be coo to get it for him but seen that in order to use the original system on a modern tv I would have to mod it. </p> <p>I seen that the new 2600+ has HDMI but the official list says the games untested. Has anyone themselves tested this games functionality on the newer 2600+? I\u2019d probably sell the original system and buy him the newer one since it also plays 7800 games. Thanks everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crazy_Ad_4747\"> /u/Crazy_Ad_4747 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j6cdez/atari_2600_mountain_king/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1j6cdez/atari_2600_mountain_king/\">[comments]</a",
