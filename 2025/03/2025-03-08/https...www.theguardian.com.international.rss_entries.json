But even with a 27-point cushion midway through the second half, they contrived to make life uncomfortable for themselves against a clearly inferior side.</p><p>Wales managed to rouse themselves from a hopeless position to claim two bonus points, when Max Llewellyn crashed over to score their fourth try at the death. Jarrod Evans\u2019s conversion, his third, pulled Wales back to within seven for the second point. Small consolation for Wales, still rooted to the foot of the table. They had been completely outplayed for an hour, but will welcome England to Cardiff next weekend with a modicum of encouragement.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/08/scotland-wales-six-nations-rugby-union-match-repo",

In her travels in the region, Colombo-Ecuadorian photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yinnaphotography/\">Yinna Higuera </a>collaborates with rural women, who in exchange share their understanding of medicinal plants and give her leaves from their gardens. In her Traces series, which has been shortlisted for a Sony world photography award, Higuera uses chlorophyll printing to superimpose the women\u2019s portraits on banana leaves, vegetables and herbs. \u201cEach of these women has a unique story,\u201d she says, \u201cyet they all share a profound bond with the land.
