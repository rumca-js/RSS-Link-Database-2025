The expected behavior that happens on all other computers is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Controller is put into pairing mode, LED begins to flash quickly.</li> <li>Controller becomes visible to computer, and is listed under devices that can be paired.</li> <li>I select the controller to pair it.</li> <li>Computer says pairing is successful. LED on controller stops flashing and holds solid.</li> <li>Controller functions perfectly.</li> </ul> <p>For my Pi, however, I get through the first 3, but even though the Pi says that pairing is successful, the controller continues to flash as though it has not been paired.

Teachers can create and manage quizzes through a web app, while students can take quizzes and view results on their phones. The backend handles user data and quiz management, with SQLite/MySQL for storage. Compared to cloud-based solutions like Kahoot! or Quizizz, this is a self-hosted, offline alternative for schools with limited connectivity. What do you think of this approach?
