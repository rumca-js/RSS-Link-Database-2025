Whether it\u2019s the aromatic spices of slow-roast lamb or the earthy warmth of soup, both of today\u2019s dishes reflect the beauty of working with what the land provides, and celebrate the joy of slowing down \u2013 in the kitchen and at the table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/08/slow-roast-lamb-borlotti-bean-soup-recipe-skye-gyngell-winter-warmer\">Continue reading...</a>",

Some people don\u2019t wait \u2013 they wear shorts and sandals even when it\u2019s cold and frosty outside \u2013 but I cope in my own way with my cooking. Today\u2019s recipe gives the appearance and flavour of a spring dish, but with none of that season\u2019s ingredients. There\u2019s a lot of green frippery \u2013 artichokes, peas, leeks and fresh herbs \u2013 but the artichokes are jarred and the petits pois are from the freezer. If you\u2019re struggling to wait for spring, too, perhaps this is the recipe for you.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/08/white-bean-leek-and-artichoke-stew-vegan-recipe-meera-sodha\">Continue reading...</a>",
