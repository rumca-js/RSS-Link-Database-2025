How is that even possible?</p> <p>No, my FPS is not maxxed out, it is &quot;only&quot; around 130 FPS, my screen is 165Hz so there should be plenty of space to push even further.

Per the FAQ on this sub and everything I&#39;ve read AMD GPUs are the way to go due to better drivers.</p> <p>If it&#39;s a PC I was thinking of something like an i7/16gb M710s Lenovo desktop and slapping a low profile RX 6400 in it. Could probably find a base system that&#39;s a bit more recent for a bit more money, though it seems corporates don&#39;t buy desktops much anymore!</p> <p>What I want to get is a home console like experience on a PC to play Indie titles (think cheap but fun stuff like brotato or spelunky or metroidvania stuff) and older games (think PS3/early 4 era PC ports like the Arkham games or stuff like the original Black Ops), no interest in online or mod",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I am starting to see a flaw in buying a gpu day one, as a linux user lol. This is the third post I have made regarding issues with this card.</p> <p>I made a post earlier about Marvel Rivals loading with a &quot;Your system doesn&#39;t support DirectX 12&quot; message, and couldn&#39;t find a solution other than just waiting.</p> <p>I decided to test out some other games because I want to compare this card to my old 6600 XT. I have tried The Finals, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, and New World. The Finals will get stuck on a loading screen before completely crashing my pc. Both Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and New World will load a quarter of the way then freeze. I have to manually end task on both to get them to close.</p> <p>A lot of the solutions that people suggested in my last post included updating Mesa, updating the kernel version, and manually downloading the amdgpu drivers. None of these solutions worked. I even clean installed a new OS with no luck.</p> <p",
