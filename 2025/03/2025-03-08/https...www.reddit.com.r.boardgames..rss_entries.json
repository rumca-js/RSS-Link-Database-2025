Interestingly, my test runs with regular old paper dont do this as much!</p> <p>My question is if this is a good method? Would a thinner paper be better to avoid the cracking on the folds perhaps? Or maybe i should be doing the folds a better way. I currently use a spudger against a ruler on the back face to scour it.
