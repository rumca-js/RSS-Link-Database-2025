Any time an LLM-based system has access\nto private data, tools it can call and exposure to potentially\nmalicious instructions (like emails and text messages from\nuntrusted strangers) there\u2019s a significant risk that an attacker\nmight subvert those tools and use them to damage or exfiltrate a\nuser\u2019s data.</p>\n\n<p>I published <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/27/prompt-injection-explained/\">this piece</a> about the risk of prompt injection\nto personal digital assistants back in November 2023, and nothing\nhas changed since then to make me think this is any less of an\nopen problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prompt injection seems to be a problem th",
