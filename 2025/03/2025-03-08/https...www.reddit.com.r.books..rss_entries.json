Everything I pick up is annoying, either because I\u2019m just not interested in the book or because it just objectively sucks.</p> <p>I\u2019m in need of book recs because I am lost. I signed up for kindle unlimited and I was able to read a couple things I genuinely liked, but I\u2019m all stuck again. I read Clare Pooley and Ruh Hogan\u2019s books a while back and I loved them so much! I\u2019ve been trying to find things similar to that because I know it\u2019d be perfect for my mental state at the moment. A bit of romance added would do me wonders as well.</p> <p>Help a fellow reader out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spideyvin\"> /u/spideyvin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j6km12/cant_find_stuff_to_read/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
