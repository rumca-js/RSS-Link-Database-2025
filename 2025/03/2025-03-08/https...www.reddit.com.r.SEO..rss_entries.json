I was positively suprised that I got engagement so fast.</p> <p>After a few days I uploaded 7 more listing types, which are around 14000 pages/listings in total. A few days after, my impressions died down to less than 200 a day and 1 or 2 visitors daily.</p> <p>Did I nuke my own website for uploading too many pages at once? What do I do? Or should I just wait for now and see what happens?</p> <p>Kind regards</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tlxy\"> /u/Tlxy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1j6u7i0/directory_website_too_many_listings/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/commen",
