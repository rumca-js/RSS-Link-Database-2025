There have been reports that Rockstar Games is apparently in talks with some of the Internet\u2019s top creators, specifically those who\u2019re in the Roblox and Fortnite spaces, in an attempt that could be looked at as the developers working on transforming GTA 6 into one big metaverse that could potentially be home to a slew of User-Generated Content. \n\nAccording to DigiDay, three anonymous industry insiders with knowledge on these meetings have confirmed that these discussions are taking place, along with dedicated GTA content creators, to potentially create custom experiences in-game that\u2019ll allow these content creators the ability to customize and modify the game\u2019s assets to fit their own personal brands.

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nGrand Theft Auto 5's latest edition, an \"Enhanced\" port for PC, is getting slammed in its Steam reviews. Although it's free, the game requires a fresh install, and you need to port your saves and account over from the old legacy version. Plus, certain text communication features are missing, and there's of course bugs. Guess we get a new, but worse, GTA 5 before we get GTA 6, huh? In other news, Sony is starting a rental program for PS5 in the UK. The program will let gamers lease PS5 hardware, or other Sony hardware like the PlayStation Portal, for a fee. While this could be fine for people just wanting to try out the console before comitting, this isn't a rent-to-own or lease-to-own program, which could make it more expensive for prospective PS5 buyers. And finally, a Cheeto sold at auction for around $88,000 USD. But not just any Cheeto, a flamin' hot one that looks like everyone's favorite firebreathing Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #GTA",
