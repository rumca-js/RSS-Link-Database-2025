I get it doesn&#39;t follow the book at all. The book has more of a darker/horror-adventure tone and the film is more light hearted PG-13 adventure. Is that basically why everyone choose to hate it? I am also going to go on a whim that most of the audience never read the book either and there are many other movie adaptations that don&#39;t follow the book closely and are still consider good movies.</p> <p>Was it basically all the same critics and audiences that also hated ",

I want to rewatch it again right now as no other movies will hit the spot the same way until they&#39;re out of my system. The trilogy never gets old for me. No matter how many times I watch it, it still excites and has an emotional impact on me. Even though I know the outcome of the story, I still feel scared for Sam and Frodo as they wander through Mordor. I keep thinking that Frodo could still succumb to the lure of the ring, even though I know he doesn&#39;t. I cry like a baby when Boromir says &quot;my king&quot; in Fellowship, and when the kingdom of Rohan bow to the hobbits in &quot;Return.&quot; The whole trilogy is a masterpiece, and I find it more immersive and transporative than any other films out there.</p> <p>Return of the King used to be my fave, but Fellowship just edges it for me these days.

The contrast between beauty and despair seems to reflect a deeper commentary on life itself: even in the midst of chaos or impending doom, there can be moments of grace, vulnerability, and even hope. </p> <p>I would love to hear your film recommendations - especially classics.
