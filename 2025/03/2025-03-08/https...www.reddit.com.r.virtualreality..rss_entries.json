I could navigate the menu using the buttons on the wheel and jump into a race without even needing to connect my sense controllers, just like in GT7. So I was already impressed. </p> <p>Now to address the elephant in the room, any racer on the VR2 has the curse to be compared against GT7, which is a bar set too high. But I was pleasantly surprised how good the racing felt. The wheel and the scale of the car felt quite natural. The handling felt solid. Coming fresh off GT, the skills were directly transferable. The game looks sharp and very feels very immersive, due to the open nature of these buggy cars. Just make sure to have strong vr legs, cause unlike GT7, the tracks have a lot of jumps and opportunities for insane crashes, where ",

There is an option for me to grab a quest 2 for 130 euros, a vive for around 100 and the pro 2 for 200 bucks. My primary goal would be playing with my PC mostly beat saber and skyrim, maybe no mans sky. My only experience is with the first PSVR and that wasnt a state of art lets be honest, but i could somewhere enjoy it, so maybe my needs are not that high. What would you recommend? I dont really want to pay more for the steam vr controllers for example or would want to mess around with any modding.</p> <p>Edit: For this price I could find a few hp reverb g2 too. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UpsetSho\"> /u/UpsetSho </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j6hvea/quest_2_vs_vive_pro_2_vs_vive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/v",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Let\u2019s say that within the next 50 years, technology has advanced enough to keep someone immersed in a virtual reality that\u2019s indistinguishable from the real world. Let\u2019s say this person is lying down in a pod designed to keep his body alive, and his brain is connected to this VR with all his senses immersed. This VR is far more fun and interesting than the boring world this man had lived in. Time perception is modified with the VR so that 100 years in the VR correspond to 1 year only in the real world. Assuming the man is 50 years old and he lives to 80 while connected to the VR, it means he can live for 3000 years of interesting and adventurous life instead of a boring 30. No need to invent anything that makes us live longer or immortals, which is impossible. We can simply develop VR that\u2019s advanced enough to change our time perception within it and \u201clive\u201d much longer. Do you think that\u2019s feasible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

If not enough people buy and play serious games than VR will come to a status like mobile gaming with casual apps and ingame transactions, also the kids will take over.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with kids having fun, but as a VR gamer I want also AA or even AAA content. </p> <p>Now I come to my topic. In the Meta Store there are messages concerning my success and some of the numbers surprise me a lot:</p> <p>Retropolis 2: I finished the first puzzle after about one hour and got the message that 4500 players have solved it. Means this game which is cheap and was accepted with good reviews has extremely few players.</p> <p>Batman Arkham Shadows VR: I finished the game and got the info that 120.000 people did so. This game has sold more than one million units and I just finished it, so I was kind of slow. Means 10% finish it!</p> <p>AC Nexus: I replay the game and just finished",
