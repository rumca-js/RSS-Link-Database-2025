Here are a few things that stood out to me:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Variety of Channels</strong>: It offers a huge range of live TV and sports channels. It\u2019s great for anyone who wants more entertainment options without being stuck to limited programming.</li> <li><strong>Streaming Quality</strong>: The 4K picture quality is amazing. I no longer miss out on high quality while watching, and even movies and shows in HD look crisp.</li> <li><strong>Compatibility with Multiple Devices</strong>: I can watch on both my TV and my phone or Firestick. The flexibility to use it across different devices is a huge plus.</li> <li><strong>Affordable Pricing</strong>: When compared to cable TV services, the plans are much cheaper, and you get the same (if not better) quality.</li> <li><st",
