This would be useful to stop me from wandering all over a grocery store that I am new to. Kroger and Walmart both have APIs that allow developers to access the aisle number of every product at every location. Does anyone know of other grocery store chains that have similar API features? If not, does anyone know where I could find this information?

However that never turned into real plans.</p> <p>That\u2019s why we built letsfinallymeet: a simple, free, no-login platform to help any group decide when and where to get together. You just create a meetup, set a date range, share the link, and let everyone vote on times and locations\u2014or let AI suggest the perfect spot.</p> <p>We\u2019d love your feedback and ideas.

That&#39;s why I&#39;ve built an app that can directly tell you how harmful some food can be. Let&#39;s say, you go to the restaurant, and things don&#39;t go as expected, and the meal you just received looks a bit suspicious. Well, with this iOS advanced app I&#39;ve just built to help myself, it will tell you right away if the meal is good enough, taking the NOVA and health rating indicators right to you to inform if it&#39;s worth going back to the place or not. I&#39;ve also recently built a feature to see the trends of your diet over time, shown like a diary. It has already given a drastic improvement on my well-being, my energy and the way I feel in general. Eating healthier isn&#39;t rocket science at the end of the day.</p> <p>The app can be directly downloaded at: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-ai-food-log-tracker/id6475162854\">https://apps.apple.com/app/mealsnap-",
