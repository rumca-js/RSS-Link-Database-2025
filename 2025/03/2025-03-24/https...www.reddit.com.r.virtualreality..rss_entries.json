It feels unsafe and distracting.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some videos where people use glasses as a HUD (Heads-Up Display) with Google Maps while driving, and I\u2019m curious if anyone here has any experience with this.</p> <p>How feasible is it? How does it work in practice?

I cannot vouch for PSVR2 or Meta Quest 3 (stand-alone). </p> <p>I was expecting this game to be totally terrible seeing the &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; review status currently on Steam. However, this is more than just a decent game. It&#39;s a pretty good game, especially if you&#39;re new to stealth-action games. This would be the perfect game for those new to the stealth genre. This game is very approachable and very forgiving. As long as you&#39;re not totally asleep at the wheel and able to be somewhat observant, you should easily complete this game. </p> <p>The best part of this game is all the toys you get to play with, including: bow &amp; arrow, shurikens, blow gun, explosive bombs, smoke bombs, poisonous food (my favorite), and land mines (okay this may be jumping the shark lol).
