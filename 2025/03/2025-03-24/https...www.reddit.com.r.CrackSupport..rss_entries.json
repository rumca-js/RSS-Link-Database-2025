However the cracking right now at least for the types of games I play seem dead right now I used to have luck with it but in the past year it\u2019s seemed like game developers have gotten better at stopping cracking or the amazing crackers in our community who I am still ever thankful too don\u2019t have the time or interest in cracking most games. This is by no fault of their own if I was a cracker I\u2019d only be cracking games I like too. But at this point I\u2019m no longer checking to see if a games cracked first instead trying to figure out the next time it goes on sale.
