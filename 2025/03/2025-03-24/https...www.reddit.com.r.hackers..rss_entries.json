I stumbled across an account on x posting videos of themselves torturing and killing crucifying and skinning alive cats and dogs he also claims he is a proud sex offender, proud pedophile, proud rapist he claims gore doesn\u2019t do it for him anymore and he needs to do it himself he\u2019s openly racist and Bigoted as well as constantly posting compilations of cannabalism he claims to live in Alaska I am not asking for anyone to hack him but if someone could possibly just help me find out what town he lives in so I can contact the proper authorities because I completely believe this guy is gonna rape and kill a child or other defenseless person and i usually would never post something like this or go here but I feel like someone\u2019s life could very literally be saved by giving this information to the right people </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
