Either about how much fun it was or the lasting friendships they made. But are there films that actors openly stated to have an uncomfortable set experience? Like collectively, the process of filming was grueling and unpleasant. Whether it was because of a difficult location or other complications. And during interviews this is a known fact, that although the movie and cast relations are good, the process was not a great experience? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NewMode8949\"> /u/NewMode8949 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jiixv9/films_with_bad_experiences_on_set/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jiixv9/films_with_bad_experiences_on_set/\">[comments]</a></span>",
