        "description": "A storm, even once it has passed, can leave traces in the ocean that last for thousands of years. These consist of sediment layers composed of coarse particles, which are different from the finer sediments associated with good weather. In the Caribbean, an international research team has now examined such sediments using a 30 m long core from a 'blue hole' offshore Belize. The analysis shows that over the past 5,700 years, the frequency of tropical storms and hurricanes in the region has steadily increased. For the 21st century, the research team predicts a significant rise in regional storm frequency as a result of climate change.",

        "description": "For successful cell division, chromosomal DNA needs to be packed into compact rod-shaped structures. Defects in this process can lead to cell death or diseases like cancer. A new study has shown how chromosomes change shape during cell division. Certain protein complexes help fold DNA into overlapping loops that repel each other, which then stack to create a rod-like structure. This is the first time scientists have directly observed an entire chromosome in high resolution within a dividing cell, offering new insights into how chromosomes are formed.",
