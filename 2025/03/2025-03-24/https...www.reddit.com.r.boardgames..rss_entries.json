However this game is very old and as far as I know this is the only card game that tries to be a TCG in one box, I feel like the gameplay itself isn&#39;t some of the best but I don&#39;t understand why no one else has done this? I feel like if there was a larger game with like 360 cards or so it could be really replayable and could even get a little competitive community (ex. Root has a recently large competitive scene for just a board game). I think epic is a sick card game in theory but never got enough attention.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose_Screen173\"> /u/Zestyclose_Screen173 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jj5wy8/thoughts_on_epic_card_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",

While I am an avid lover of board games, I realize she does not enjoy them as much as I do. (She certainly isn\u2019t trying to solo any games on our shelf \ud83d\ude02) We will play games together on occasion but it\u2019s not something that she generally wants to do unless I ask. For my birthday this year, she put a post up on social media and blocked me from seeing it. She posted a picture of my Kallax shelf and asked her friends if there are any couples that would like to join us for game nights. She must have had 20+ replies from her friends ranging from praising my collection to asking when we can get together. We hosted our first official game night (that was not family) a few days later. We had a great time and are already planning on the next night we can get together. We are now trying to find time to host several of the other couples as well. I just want to say that this ",

It is called &quot;Brandon Tycoon&quot;, a locally branded game based on the city I grew up in. It was a &quot;Jay-Cees Project&quot; printed by Leech Printing. The board game is in perfect condition, except for the rules pamphlet. All of the rules to play are faded inside and I can&#39;t read them. Which makes it difficult to play, heh.</p> <p>I know it is a longshot, but I was hoping that someone has a copy of the game and can get me a photo of the rules, or point me in the direction of where I can find them. I&#39;ve done some searching, and can&#39;t seem to find the people who made it (or anything related to the game) anywhere. I have tried to contact the printing company about it but haven&#39;t heard back. If anyone can help, that would be great.

When catacombs came out I bought it and sold the original game. </p> <p>However, I&#39;ve always been curious about the expansions for the original game. Yesterday I found two expansions for sale used and bought them, Temple of the Ape Lord and Gold and Silk. I&#39;m wondering if anyone has tried playing expansions with the Catacombs deck rather than the original? Did you find any unbalance? Are there any adjustments necessary? I&#39;m curious what your thoughts and experiences are.</p> <p>I&#39;ve e looked through the deck. There are only about 8 cards which appear useless as they focus on lock picks, prisoner or waypoints. Another handful have an effect on arrival that won&#39;t apply but the card itself seems fine.
