Like many startup founders, I had big hopes and dreams tied to launch day. I imagined it as this fireworks moment\u2014a culmination of all our hard work where the world would immediately see and embrace what we\u2019d built. But guess what? Reality had other plans!</p> <p>What I realized is that launch day isn\u2019t the finish line\u2014it\u2019s the starting point. Sure, it\u2019s important, but expecting it to immediately change everything was setting myself up for disappointment. A startup is a long journey, and success usually comes from the consistent work done before and after launch. It\u2019s about building relationships, nurturing an audience, and improving over time. Launch day is just a tiny, special part of that process.</p> <p>Looking back, I\u2019m grateful for the lessons that came with setting my expectations straight. It\u2019s made me more focused on the long game and less hung up on on",

So you might be asking why?... well I realised that managing rental properties can be stressful, especially when tenants forget to pay on time or you have to send manual reminders every month. I realised that many landlords, especially those managing multiple tenants, struggle with keeping track of due dates, late payments, and follow-ups.

His workday ends when the &quot;work&quot; side hits 4 hours of pure focus time.</p> <p>That simple idea made him more mindful of wasted time. If he finishes his 4 hours of work by, say, noon, the rest of the day is totally guilt-free.
