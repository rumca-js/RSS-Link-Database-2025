I&#39;ve tried looking at Goodreads and fivebooks, but nothing has really caught my eye. I&#39;m looking for a good sci-fi/fantasy/historical fiction book with a slow burn romance subplot (I don&#39;t want the romance to be the main thing, nor do I want a ton of sex scenes). I want it to be well-written otherwise I can&#39;t really connect with the story. I just finished reading &quot;A Most Agreeable Murder&quot; by julia seales and liked it pretty well, but I&#39;m looking for something not necessarily the same, but also with an interesting concept. I also probably won&#39;t like it as much unless it has a female main character.</p> <p>ETA: I like greek mythology stuff also (was super into percy jackson), and Cinder was one of my favorite series ever when I was younger</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
