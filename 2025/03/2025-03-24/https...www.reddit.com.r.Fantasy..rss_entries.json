A fair few titles were scifi, so this endeavour has already involved some John Christopher, bit of Nicholas Fisk, and of course a dash of Brian Earnshaw.

The first two books are a decent but intriguing magical academia. The last three books are where I feel it gets really good however. The series takes a really Interesting turn and you can really see how it affects the characters. All in all I just wanted to see if anyone else likes this series.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ethan_613\"> /u/ethan_613 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jiq5ey/the_tapestry_series_by_henry_h_neff/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jiq5ey/the_tapestry_series_by_henry_h_neff/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I just find myself wondering: why medieval? Why not more early modern, or post-industrial, or futuristic fantasy worlds \u2014 especially given how magic opens up possibilities beyond historical models?</p> <p>Not asking this to be snarky at all \u2014 I know tropes and settings evol",

I had this feeling with Kate Elliott, for example, and Robert Jordan. It felt like the plot didn&#39;t NEED to be that long, like it was being artificially prolonged. The length didn&#39;t feel EARNED by the intrinsic quality of the series of events.</p> <p>In contrast, I never felt that way about the first six books in the Robin Hobb fool series, even though some of the books end in a crappy place and I didn&#39;t feel like Hobb had necessarily planned the whole thing out perfectly in advance. I know some people find these books too misery-porn-y and I get it, but my point is that the plot felt like it unfolded organically and not like things were being &#39;spun out&#39;. </p> <p>",
