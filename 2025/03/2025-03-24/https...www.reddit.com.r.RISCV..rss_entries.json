        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,<br/> I was working with the CH32x035 IC and I programmed it once using a usb-c connector by writing a code in arduino IDE and the compiling it as a hex file and uploading it using WCHISP studio. However, I cannot upload a new piece of code as the IC is not being detected by windows anymore. I researched a bit and found out you need to put the IC into download mode by supplying a voltage to PC17. After doing that, the IC appears in the device manager but as an unrecognized device and it does not work with WCHISP studio. Can someone please help me to reprogram the chip and what are the steps that I could be missing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Username_is-username\"> /u/Username_is-username </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1jj5feg/programming_ch32x035/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1jj5feg/programming_ch32x",
