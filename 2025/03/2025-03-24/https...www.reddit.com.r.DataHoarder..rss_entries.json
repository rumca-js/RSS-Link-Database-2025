For aftermarket enclosures I have found this to be almost never the case. After ejecting the enclosed drive in Windows, they will just keep it spinning and remain lit up until you cut power to the enclosure. This results in &quot;unsafe&quot; shutdowns for the drives inside, with the &quot;POR Recovery Count&quot; attribute increasing every time you turn off the enclosure.</p> <p><strong>Should I care about the unsafe shutdowns/POR Recovery Count if the drive is always ejected in Windows beforehand? Can unsafe shutdowns still do any harm?</strong></p> <p>It seems to me that an increasing POR Recovery Count is virtually inevitable in all but the most basic fixed/internal-drive scenarios. I remember I had a Samsung T5 external SSD connected to my Xbox One X and every shutdown of that console seemed to be consider",
