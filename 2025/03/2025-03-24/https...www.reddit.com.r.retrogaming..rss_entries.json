So I host a retro gaming podcast called Backwards Compatible, and this week\u2019s episode my cohost and I are discussing the best and worst game collections/re-releases/remakes/remasters. </p> <p>What started the idea for the discussion was the recent addition of the Cowabunga Collection to the PS+ lineup, which we both agree did a magnificent job in terms of bang for your buck. But then he started playing the Tomb Raider collection released last year and has been far from impressed (though it\u2019s mostly due to how the games themselves have aged, and other than slight visual improvements, it\u2019s largely the same game). </p> <p>Anyway, would love some insights I could use on the show tonight around what had been a success and what hasn\u2019t. </p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DanimalHouse\"> /u/DanimalHouse </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jivef4",

I\u2019m comfortable with code, but I\u2019m not great at pixel art or sound, so if someone\u2019s into that, it\u2019d be awesome to collaborate.</p> <p>Also, if you know of other good retro game dev contests, drop them in the comments\ud83d\ude0e I\u2019m down for anything that involves pushing old hardware to its limits.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Moment_6711\"> /u/Ok_Moment_6711 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

The only part i remember is a location, it was in a train car and you had to Remove (Force) a plate in your way to get through the train car.</p> <p>Sadly that might be the only real part that i remember from the game, but i know that i loved it with all my heart as a kid and it was a game you had to just download at the time, it was not a dvd/cd game.</p> <p>If anyone can remember the same game as me, please i beg you if you still remember it to help a person out with wishfull thinking that the game still exists.</p> <p>And very much i would have to thank you from my heart.</p> <",

It&#39;s fairly common knowledge in the retro gaming community that old consoles could hold a max 255 bits of data at a time, which limited you to 255 rupees in The Legend Of Zelda, and limits arcade games like Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig-Dug, etc. to level 255 before they show some whacked out variation of the previous levels. However, Duck Hunt, one of my favourite 8-bit games of all time, fails at level 100 in all three game modes. My first thought was that maybe it was a simple hardware limitation to the original NES, but then I remembered; someone had coded a TAS robot to play the original Tetris past the extremely volatile and easy-to-crash stages of level 137 and beyond, all the way up to level 255 and have it loop around back to level 0. So I was wondering, why does Duck Hunt max out at level 99 and not 255 like most other 8",
