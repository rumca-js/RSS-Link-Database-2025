These books are the perfect mix of cheesy serial killer novels while being incredibly fast paced reads. </p> <p>They\u2019re not exactly works of art, not even close, but there\u2019s something irresistibly entertaining about them that keeps you turning the pages.</p> <p>The series is very episodic, except for 2 books (if you want to know which two, its the ones with &#39;evil&#39; in the title), but even those could potentially be read as standalones. Each book is about 420-450 pages long, and has about a 100 chapters, so each chapter is very short, and almost always ends on a mini cliffhanger lol. </p> <p>Most books are incredibly over the top, cheesy, and at times very raw. The writing is not terrible by any stretch but it&#39;s not something you read for the prose. Funnily enough, all of them are very highly rated on Goodreads, each book ",

All I remember about it was it was about a small group of kids or pre teens going on misadventures. </p> <p>One book I remember was about them exploring some sort of medieval tower they discovered was in their town that was filled with orcs. They discovered that there was some witch or sorceress that was of similar age to the group of kids that was running this tower. </p> <p>And another book in the series was of somehow dinosaurs traveled through time to their modern day era. That same tower from the previous book was being attacked by a T. rex they were fighting off at one point in the book. </p> <p>I feel as if I\u2019m going crazy as I\u2019m not finding anything online about it. But that could be something lost forever to me. Does the little tid bit of information ring a bell to anyone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",

I don&#39;t understand why companies (especially those who get the shipments of books early like Barnes and Noble) can&#39;t ship the pre-orders <em>before</em> release day so that I can get the book on time. I preordered Sunrise on the Reaping and have basically been waiting for a week and it&#39;s still not here yet because UPS and the Post Office are moving at a snails pace. It&#39;s been sitting at a post office in my city, only one zip code away, ever since the 19th with no updates. </p> <p>It&#39;s so frustrating!
