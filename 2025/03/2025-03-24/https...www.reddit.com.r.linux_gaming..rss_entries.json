Im someone making the switch from Windows 11 and the real tradeoff Iv had since switching is playing with nice HDR in my games like Cyberpunk, Silent Hill 2, and Stalker 2. I kind of messed around with steam launch commands and had slight luck but it never looked quite right. IDK if I was getting true HDR or HDR signal through SDR. Silent Hill was bright but like the entire image was bright and tht flashlight was way overblown. Im really looking forward to being able to just run a game in steam and click HDR inside the game. Is there any advice to be given if I&#39;d like to get HDR working properly in games? A crucial launch command? I&#39;m just typing some commands into steam right? Nothing more? Games should recognize my monitors capabilities and values correct? If this is a lost cause let me know so I can stop tht suffering lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",

Surprisingly it is decent runs most stuff i use. And now i am starting to think that its not possible to fix steam cuz of how poopoo my gpu is. Watched many tutorials and got nowhere.

Simple as that.</p> <p>Now, for kernel level stuff that all makes sense, those games can shove it for all I care. But for games with easy anti cheat and battle eye, is it actually just drag and drop? Or are there other reasons game devs don&#39;t implement it?

OSRS works fine using just proton, but I want to use the third party client RuneLite, and the best way to do that on linux if you have a Steam-Linked OSRS account is through adamcakes Bolt launcher which runs RuneLite off a .jar file. I have confirmed that my launch options work running them through Terminal, they currently are bash -c &quot;/usr/bin/bolt&quot;. I have tried many other ways of pointing it to the bolt folder or my runelite.jar, all of which work in terminal just fine but Steam seems to skip over them. Any suggestions? Or anything else I need to provide?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/liquidtrailmix\"> /u/liquidtrailmix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jidvr5/launching_osrs_bolt_launcher_through_ste",
