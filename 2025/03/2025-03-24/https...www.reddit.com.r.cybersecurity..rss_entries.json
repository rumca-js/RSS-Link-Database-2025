I&#39;ve developed a new approach to cyber threat categorization called the Top Level Cyber Threat Clusters (TLCTC) framework. Unlike other models that often mix threats, vulnerabilities, and outcomes, this one provides a clear, cause-oriented approach to understanding the cyber threat landscape.</p> <h1>What is the TLCTC Framework?</h1> <p>The TLCTC framework organizes cyber threats into 10 distinct clusters, each targeting a specific generic vulnerability. What makes it different is its logical consistency - it separates threats (causes) from events (compromises) and consequences (like data breaches). It also clearly distinguishes threats from threat actors, and importantly, it does not use &quot;control failures&quot; or &quot;IT system types&quot; as structural elements like many existing frameworks do.</p> <p>Th",
