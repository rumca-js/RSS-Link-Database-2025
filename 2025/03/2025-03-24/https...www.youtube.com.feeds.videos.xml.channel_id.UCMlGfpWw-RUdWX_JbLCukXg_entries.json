Curiously, many of these algorithms have dragon-related names like Dragon, Grisu, Errol, Ryu and Dragonbox.\n\nHere mythology meets technology and we shall introduce the new dragon that has just arrived in the den.\n\n(Please leave your bows and arrows at home, they won't be necessary here.)\n---\n\nThe following topics are some of those covered in this presentation:-\nalgorithms, mathematics, arithmetic, floating point, floating point numbers, floating point math, floating point arithmetic, decimal floating-point representation, binary floating-point representation, IEEE 754",
