I picked one of the more expensive ones hoping it had all the bells and whistles. Nope! No WiFi. I have all the tools needed to to remove the WiFi chip and Antenna module just looking for a victim (or two). Will pay. Any information for sourcing one would be helpful as well.

I\u2019m primarily following two tutorials to get it done that are both very helpful, but I\u2019m running into an issue with the audio. I have two speakers that I want to use, but I\u2019m having trouble finding a stereo I2s DAC that doesn\u2019t use a line in port for the audio. I need to connect the wires from the speakers directly to the DAC, and I can\u2019t use a HAT because I need the GPIO pins on the pi for the controller buttons. I\u2019d use a mono speaker, but I don\u2019t really have space in the design for a front facing mono speaker, and I already have two stereo speakers to put on the sides. I\u2019d also be open to using a display that has speakers integrated, but I can\u2019t find any that are 3.5 inches.

Problem is now I&#39;m having issues accessing my nginx container as well as a few other self hosted items. Upon researching it is pointing me to needing IPV6, but everything I&#39;ve tried doesn&#39;t seem to be getting it back enabled and for the life of me can&#39;t remember what/where I shut it off. Every search just doesn&#39;t get me anywhere and I&#39;m at my wits end.
