Yet I wouldn\u2019t dream of ruining an evening of bouncy pop by accosting her, which I\u2019m sure goes for most Carpenter fans.

I loved the feeling of making people laugh, but the thought of it being a job had never crossed my mind. A career started to snowball without me even realising and I\u2019ve been delighted and astounded by that ever since. I\u2019ve grown up in this job, and 18-year-old me would never have believed it possible.</p><p><strong>Who did you admire when you were starting out?<br></strong>Rob Rouse. To this day, if I see I\u2019m on a lineup with him I\u2019m buzzing. I\u2019ve also been in awe of Ross Noble\u2019s ludicrous genius since before I even started comedy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/mar/24/lauren-pattison-comic-russell-howard\">Continue reading...</a>",

At first, the fly seemed to buzz more and more loudly and shake more and more vigorously. The spider, undeterred, efficiently and precisely tightened its prison.
