Boyfriend and girlfriend are introduced as friend. Fiance and spouse are different designation. There was no cover-up intended.&quot;</p> <p>For reference, my dad is 60 and this introduction was to a 67 year old woman. Is this true??

He went on a weird rant the other day about how people can do what they want but he doesn&#39;t understand trans people, he said it while we were in the car on a two hour trip to another town so I didnt feel comfortable breaking up while we were there.
