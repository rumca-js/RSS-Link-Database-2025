        "description": "Maia Stern | March 24, 2025\nCass McCombs' songs are slow, languid and beautiful, which feels like the right counterbalance to our fast-paced times. With a set list culled from his deep and rich catalog, this Tiny Desk can serve as a reminder to slow down.\n\nThe set begins with \"Priestess,\" a brand new song just released today. The lyrics are vivid, yet mysterious, with references to the Devil, the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome, and the late John Prine \u2014 it's about someone who encouraged McCombs' songwriting early on. He follows with \"County Line\" from Wit's End and \"Robin Egg Blue\" from Humor Risk \u2014 both songs were released in 2011, the year that I met my husband, who introduced me to McCombs' music. He closes with the moody \"Opium Flower\" from Not the Way, his debut EP released in 2002. If you look closely, you can spot a rare copy of the double 7-inch record that we snuck onto the Desk before the concert.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Priestess\"\n\"County Line\"\n\"Robin Egg Blue\"\n\"Opium Flower\"\n\nMUSICIAN",
