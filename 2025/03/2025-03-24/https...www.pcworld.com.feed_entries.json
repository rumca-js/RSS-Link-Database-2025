It won\u2019t even cost you that much if you hit a good deal\u2014like this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, Amazon has a special discount for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGICIAN-Computers-Display-Desktop-Channel/dp/B0DHCBX9LD/\">Acemagician M1 mini PC</a>, which is now just $309 (was $399). That\u2019s 23% less than its original MSRP and worth it for a budget device with this much power. (You\u2019ll need Prime for this deal. Don\u2019t have it? <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">Start a free trial right now!</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes the M1 mini PC such a winner?
