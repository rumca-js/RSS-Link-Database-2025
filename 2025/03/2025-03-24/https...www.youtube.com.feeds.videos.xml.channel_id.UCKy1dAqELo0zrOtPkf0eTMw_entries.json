        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nTake-Two, the owners of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, have issued a take-down of another fan-made mod. YouTuber Dark Space has posted a video explaining what happened with his mod that put what he believed to be an accurate GTA 6 map into GTA 5. Dark Space argues that such moves hurt Take-Two's relationship with the community, the same community that makes its games popular in the first place. In other news, there's a not-zero percent chance that the popular online game Palworld makes its way to the Nintendo Switch 2, given the system is powerful enough to run it. That might be a little weird, considering developer Pocket Pair is involved in a lawsuit with Nintendo. And finally, MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle finally has a PS5 release date.",
