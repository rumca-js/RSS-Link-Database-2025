But early seasons of even big shows like Big Brother and American Idol have been impossible for me to find. Honestly a perfect example of piracy being necessary for preservation because there\u2019s no reruns or physical release of full seasons for basically any of these shows. They were made to be dumped on TV and forgotten forever. Are there any streamers that consistently host that kind of content? I\u2019ve combed through the mega thread and checked a few amalgam sources like Heartive but no luck for the most part. Also I don\u2019t have the setup to torrent, I know a lot of people do but I just don\u2019t have the protections I want in place to do it.
