        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Trump administration wants to ban people from using food stamps on junk food. This is, obviously, the correct position. And yet, a bunch of conservative influencers mysteriously and suddenly came out against it over the weekend. This is a bizarre story \u2014 we\u2019ll discuss. Also, \u201cSnow White\u201d predictably bombs at the box office. RFK Jr. wants to ban cell phones from schools. The only question is: why isn\u2019t that already the policy in every school in the country? And more and more people on the left are claiming that the 2024 election was stolen. What evidence do they have to support that claim? Well, none at all.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:30 Opening\n01:54 - 18:43 Paid-Off \u201cConservatives\u201d Are Fighting For Your Right To Use Food Stamps For Soda\n19:30 - 27:59 \u201cSnow White\u201d Has A Dismal Opening Weekend Despite Its Huge Budget\n28:00 - 39:37 RFK Jr. Wants To Ban Cellphones In School\n39:38 - 43:37 Rosie O'Donnell Implies That The Election Was Stolen\n45:05 - 54:39 M",
