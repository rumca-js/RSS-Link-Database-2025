It&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s a great deck builder that can be different every time you play it (think Dominion) but it ALSO has a map where you are physically laying your track to connect cities together in your rail network. Tons of fun.</p> <p>At this point we learned that this was one of a series of games, the next two being <em>Planes</em> and <em>Automobiles.</em> I, again, found planes rather cheap on eBay, so next game night we busted it out and found a good (albeit not amazing) mancala style cube moving game about trying to move your passenger cubes into planes. Not bad, not amazing. Solid 6.5/10.</p> <p>So then, obviously, I had to get automobiles. Go back to eBay and, y",

Looking for &quot;best&quot; games as in &quot;most fun to play&quot; and/or &quot;most absorbing,&quot; not &quot;best examples of the genre.&quot; For example, many people&#39;s choice for a best light strategy game might be &quot;Ticket to Ride to Ride,&quot; while a &quot;medium&quot; game might be &quot;Pandemic.&quot; And this could be ANY style of game: Euro, coop, etc. The light/medium quality in this case refers to how difficult the rules are to grok and how long it takes to play.
