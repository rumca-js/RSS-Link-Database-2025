Stormlight and the Cosmere is such a tricky one for me to get a solid opinion on. On one hand, the world building is obviously epic. From a shattered god creating other gods, to complex magic systems and lore, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve read much quite like it. On the other hand, it sometimes feels that learning about magic systems can feel like a science class, the writing can be \u201cmeh\u201d particularly when it\u2019s dialogue, and the humor is straight up some of the cringiest and worst I\u2019ve read. </p> <p>HOWEVER, I also can\u2019t stand overly flowery prose.

It was easily my favourite read of the past few years and I can definitely see it or one of its sequels becoming my favourite book of all time but I&#39;ve been really thinking about it and when you break down the book into smaller components like prose, worldbuilding, plot, character etc. the book isn&#39;t all that exceptional. But when everything comes together, it&#39;s an absolute masterpiece that got me out of my reading slump (and put me in one again because I wanted to read the sequel so badly lol).

Also I want to say how fantastic of a writer and storyteller Mark Lawrence is! This is my first series by him and I think he might already be on my favorite authors list so huge shoutout to him!
