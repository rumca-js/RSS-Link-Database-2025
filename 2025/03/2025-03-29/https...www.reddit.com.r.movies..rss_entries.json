Melanie Griffith was very wooden and there is an early bit-part for Lawrence Fishburn which you will miss if you&#39;re not paying attention. Lot&#39;s of money put into sets for sure. The story had potential and direction by Steve De Jarnatt is adequate but I was expecting something more. I guess the plot was simply too predictable. Surprised Melanie Griffith was cast in &quot;Working Girl&quot; along Harrison Ford so soon after this performance.

My daughter and I love magical movies, The Princess Bride, stuff like that, this was complete garbage.

It is not about what happens it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue ,clash nd unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases , egos nd frustrations it ia all so uncomfortably real nd that is where the brilliance lies !! The cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter ,the shots get closer nd by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word , Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them , to understand that justice requir",

Mr. Grey becoming more open and learning that it\u2019s okay to be a sadist and enjoy it with someone. Helping lee discover herself and letting her discover more about himself. I have looked and it\u2019s a decently underground movie so I haven\u2019t found anyone to truly talk to about it or to recommend movies where the two main characters matched each others freak perfectly.
