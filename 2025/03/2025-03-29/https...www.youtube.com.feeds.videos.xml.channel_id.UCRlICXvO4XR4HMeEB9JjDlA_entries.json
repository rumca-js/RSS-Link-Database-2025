        "description": "If a tree falls in the forest but nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound? This is the perfect excuse for cheaters, if you ask me...\n\nPhilosophers like George Berkeley argued that nothing exists unless it\u2019s perceived. Scientists, on the other hand, say sound only happens when vibrations hit an ear and get processed by a brain. No ears? No sound. But plants, bizarrely, do respond to vibrations\u2014so from their perspective, the tree might as well be screaming.\n\nMeanwhile, quantum physicists suggest reality itself changes depending on who\u2019s observing it. In short, the universe is weird, and trees might be noisier than we think.",
