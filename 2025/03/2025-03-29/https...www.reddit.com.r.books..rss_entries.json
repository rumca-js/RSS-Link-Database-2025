Before she knows it, she has summoned a magical sea that sweeps her away to the Abarat, a world where each hour is an island filled with the stuff of dreams - or nightmares. As Candy explores the many wonders of the Abarat, long buried secrets - including her own impossible connection to the fantastical world - come to light, and unlikely heroes step forth to face down terrors the likes of which neither their world - or ours - have ever seen. </p> <p>The series is both whimsical and dark (increasingly so with each book).

When reading physical books, it\u2019s easy to use a bookmark or jot down notes in the margins. But when it comes to reading on a Kindle or other e-readers, how do you save these memorable quotes in a way that\u2019s readily accessible? Do you rely on Kindle&#39;s highlight feature, or do you prefer keeping a separate diary or journal for this purpose? Is it worth maintaining one, or does it end up feeling like a hassle?

By the end of the book I was crying, it was so odd reading about this family and their homes history while I was doing the same thing for myself.
