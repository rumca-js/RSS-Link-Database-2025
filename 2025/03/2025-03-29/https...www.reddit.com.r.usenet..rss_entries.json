While there were certainly hiccups at the beginning, over the months since then, ISPs got on board and routing improved and AU based users saw increased performance while getting their Usenet traffic locally for the first time. <a href=\"https://redd.it/1iy5ybc\">https://redd.it/1iy5ybc</a></p> <p>Sure, that satisfied Australia&#39;s Usenet itch but what about other locations deemed not worthy by others? Should they just have to continue to settle for less and deal with the status quo?</p> <p>With this announcement comes the availability of 2 more locations for Blocknews, Fr",

I&#39;ve read the faq on here and browsed through the sub, but I&#39;ve got bad analysis paralysis. There are just too many options and I don&#39;t know where to start. Can I get a recommendation for a solid set up (indexer, provider, software) that doesn&#39;t cost much so I can dip my toes in?
