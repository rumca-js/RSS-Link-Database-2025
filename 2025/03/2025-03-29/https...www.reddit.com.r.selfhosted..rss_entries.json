All the containers are behind traefik for SSL and routing. I want to limit access for certain users to certain apps. Looking at my tailscale ACL i dont think this helps as i must provide access currently to 443, which means every user has full access to all my apps. Could i do the limitation in Traefik by adding a second entrypoint? For example, i create another entrypoint via 8443. I then change the entrypoint for the individual apps i want limited access to, to this entrypoint. I then give the group access in my tailscale ACL to 8443 instead of 443? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TinySweet2648\"> /u/TinySweet2648 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jmi4um/tailscale_traefik_user_routing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",

I am using docker compose to run apps and traefik as reverse proxy.</p> <p>I wanted to learn about how Identity management works and what best way to learn other than doing it hands on by setting up the provider end to end with everything like MFA, SSO, condiitinal access etc.</p> <p>I see that they are many identity providers that can be used to selfhost like keycloak, authelia, authentik, zitadel etc.</p> <p>Which would be ideal for my hardware and also helps me to setup everything and learn about everything in the process?</p> <p>Please suggest.
