But okay, I admit it&#39;s a stupid idea anyway. Still worth mentioning (solvable) - When the library is created, despite the drive having permissions for all, Steam will assign it to group of your user, and your user, in my case <code>damglador:damglador</code> (solvable) - To solve this you have to create a group, assign the library to that group with <code>chgrp -R group /path/libraryfolder</code>. Change permissions <code>chmod -R 775 /path/libraryfolder</code> (this allows everything for group and owner and only view for others). ",

And omg. And cards works so much better with Linux. All I did was uninstall the Nvidia drivers and everything works better, like I know it&#39;s a newer card but Wayland actually works now it was so buggy with the 980ti. Honestly going to stick with and until Nvidia drivers are better with Linux.

Discrete graphics card is enabled and the recommended nvidea 550 driver installed. Whenever I run a game, I get terrible FPS drops while also not fulling utilizing the hardware. For example, if I run black ops 1 in 4K max graphics with fps capped to 240, I will get 240 when looking at the edge of a map, but anywhere from 40-120 when looking toward the middle of a map. During the drops, the GPU still remains at 30-40% utilization, the CPU is around 40-60% utilization, and the RAM is around 25% utilization.
