Basically, it\u2019s a login hustle for collecting bonus money from sweepstakes casinos - no gambling involved, just free cash you can actually cash out. I don\u2019t know much about casinos, but this list has been making me $30 a day in maybe like 40 minutes. </p> <p>Now, I\u2019m wondering - could this scale? I\u2019m curious if anyone\u2019s thought about automating it. Could you set it up so it claims the bonuses on its own? Could you register accounts for others and have them collecting too? Maybe even build an app to make it all easier? </p> <p><a href=\"https://sweepstakescasinop.wixsite.com/risk-free-sweepstake/download\">FREE PDF OF DAILY LOGIN BONUS LIST &amp; GUIDE</a></p> <p>It feels like there\u2019s potential here, but I\u2019m not sure where to take it. Anyone have experience with scaling something like this? Or have any ideas on how it could be automated? Would love to ",

It started with me noticing how scattered and vague most of the available information was, especially for local users trying to find legit platforms or understand the bonus terms.</p> <p>So I built a lightweight site that makes things a bit clearer. It lists online casinos relevant to the Azerbaijani market and keeps the layout simple, so it\u2019s not overwhelming like many of the big aggregator sites.</p> <p>It\u2019s given me a great excuse to learn more about localized content, user-first design, and how SEO behaves in smaller markets. Definitely still iterating, but it\u2019s been one of those slow and steady builds that\u2019s actually fun to work on.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I have got so far: <a href=\"https://kazino-bet.com/\">https://kazino-bet.com/</a></p> <p>I would love to hear from anyone else who&#39;s explored smaller or reg",

I am from a third-world country and have a big time difference with the USA. But you know a Reddit algorithm.</p> <p>The best time to submit a post is when the most audience is active. In previous times I would just write a post and wait for 8 hours when it hit midnight in my country.</p> <p>It is always a pain because you can forget to submit on time.</p> <p>Now, I solved this problem. You can easily schedule your posts and forget about it.</p> <p>Based, of course, on your feedback, I would love to add more cool stuff like:</p> <p>cross-posting via different subreddits</p> <p>hook generator</p> <p>analytics</p> <p>and a lot more.</p> <p>Currently, web app is in the beta and that&#39;s why it is free to use.</p> <p>I am open to any feedback that you want to leave.</p> <",
