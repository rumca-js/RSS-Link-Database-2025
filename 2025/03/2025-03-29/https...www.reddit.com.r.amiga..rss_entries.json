It had punks in the game and maybe a space setting. I remember the one level we played it was set in a city at night time. </p> <p>That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got unfortunately.

It was a game about two santa clauses playing football (soccer) on an ice field. You could kick the ball into the opponent&#39;s goal to score, or kick each other around. The controls very very &quot;slippery&quot; and the characters would bounce all over the field violently. There was also a small goal screen where the scoring santa was happy and the losing santa was angry whenever a goal occured. Does anyone remember this game and know if its on youtube?</p> <p>The game&#39;s language was english, and it was probably some obscure indie game. The music was awesome.
