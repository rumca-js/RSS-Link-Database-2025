It looks like AI is going to change things, big time. In the next 10 to 20 years, a lot of the usual desk work might get done by AI, or at least, people will be working with AI a lot more. Imagine for example, instead of just being a financial analyst, you&#39;re an analyst who uses AI to do the really complicated stuff. Or a salesperson who uses AI to figure out exactly what each customer wants. And we&#39;ll probably see a lot more jobs like AI experts,AI builders, AI consultants, AI specialists, AI analytics and so on. Basically, no matter what you studied in college or what you&#39;re good at, you&#39;ll prbably need to know about AI to keep up in the job market. It&#39;s like learning a new language, but for the working world.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JustToKnow_\"> /u/JustToKnow_ </",
