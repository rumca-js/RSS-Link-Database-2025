I have been laid off from my first job after 9 months of experience.It was a high paying job(12 lpa). 75% of the workforce was eliminated within 2 hours bringing down strength from 75 to 25. This was due to cost cutting due to recent acquisition.</p> <p>I have experience in following fields 1) Angular 2) Go lang 3) Native app dev 4) Flutter</p> <p>Out of which I had learnt web dev in company but u have done 2 internships previously (1.5 yrs internship experience)</p> <p>So I want your all guidance how should I strategize now. Should I accept any paycuts? Or should I switch to other domains.but ig it won&#39;t be much high paying since I don&#39;t have experience in it</p> <p>I have been given 4 months salary as runway though </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Classicalbot99\"> /u/Classicalbot99 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jmelfj/laid_off",
