        "description": "The stakes are high for Fatal Fury\u2019s first new entry in a two and a half decades to live up to its prior reputation as one of the most iconic fighting games of all time. Thankfully, given the rejuvenation of its predecessor\u2019s fighting mechanics, a healthy dose of modern mechanics of its own, and that awe-striking art design, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves has every chance to place itself amongst the pantheon of world\u2019s greatest fighting games. \n\nFast-paced, technical, and complex, yet with ample onboarding for newcomers, this feature will discuss all that\u2019s new and all that\u2019s old in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves and, hopefully, illustrate why even casual fighting fans should be excited by this one.",
