Wait, hang on a sec, let me revise that statement: People are pretty pissed off at <em>all</em> printers, perpetually, but HP printers in particular have been extremely irksome for the last few years. A class-action lawsuit was filed over HP\u2019s attempts to lock users into its expensive first-party ink, but the results are probably far short of what you want to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, a California federal judge finally resolved a lawsuit that stretched over more than four years, ending in HP neither admitting fault nor compensating the vast majority of customers affected by software updates that were called \u201cmalware\u201d by the litigants. Just three parties that brought the suit will get $5,000 USD each, and customers will have the option to roll back the offending updates on 21 models of LaserJet printer. The full",
