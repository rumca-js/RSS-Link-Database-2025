The next phase, AMoRE-II, is being developed at Yemilab with enhanced detection systems to further explore this rare nuclear process.

According to reports, primordial black holes that existed in the early universe could have evaporated through Hawking radiation, impacting matter distribution. The research explores how these black holes might have shaped galaxies and cosmic structures. Although no direct evidence has been found, scientists believe future observations could confirm their role in cosmology and particle physics.",

Vapour tracers released at various altitudes will help track these movements. The findings may lead to better space weather predictions, benefiting satellite and communication systems worldwide.
