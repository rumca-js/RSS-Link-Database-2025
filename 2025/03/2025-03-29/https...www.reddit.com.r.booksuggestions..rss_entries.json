I really love how all of these books take place over many years, focus on multiple characters&#39; lives, and how the authors add in little funny bits of idiosyncrasies in what is generally a dark emotional story that make the world feel so much realer. Hyperion and Wicked both have lots of literary references that I appreciate. And all of these books have excellent pacing in my opinion; the moment I start to get a little bored with a scene, it moves on to the next. Does anyone have any good recommendations of stories like that? It doesn&#39;t have to be sci-fi or fantasy, but these books all happen to fit in that category. </p> <p>On the other hand, I&#39;m very sensitive to YA fiction and",

The girls I work with are ages 13-18, have vast trauma histories, and are currently living at a residential school. They LOVE to read but have very limited access to books, so l am putting together a library for them. I will also be hosting a monthly therapeutic book club. Each month will have a different theme (listed below), and each girl will read an on-theme book of their choice and come prepared to group to talk about it and relate it to their lives and personal struggles. I want to ensure that I&#39;m providing books that the girls will actually be interested in and enjoy reading, but I&#39;m not very familiar with YA. Thank you in advance for your suggestions!</p> <p>Monthly Themes: Jan - Fresh Starts and Future Dreams (self-help) Feb - Black Voices; Love in All Forms (romantic, familial, platonic) March - Fearless Female",
