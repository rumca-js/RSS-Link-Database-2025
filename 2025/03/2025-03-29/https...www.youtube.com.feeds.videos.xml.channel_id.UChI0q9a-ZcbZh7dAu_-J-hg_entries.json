I wanted to weigh in with an opinion that a lot of the backlash is unjustified, unwarranted, and uneccesary.\n\nThe game has flaws, there are valid critiques to be made, but we are witnessing the unflinching stubbornness of ideology and profit motives when they conflict with the reality of a game that is not nearly as bad as some creators have been saying.\n\nEntrenching yourself in a position so deep that you are unwilling or unable to move in the face of new evidence is not a healthy way to make the industry better. \n\n\n\nPRIOR YASUKE VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lcZS6zmvRE\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https:",
