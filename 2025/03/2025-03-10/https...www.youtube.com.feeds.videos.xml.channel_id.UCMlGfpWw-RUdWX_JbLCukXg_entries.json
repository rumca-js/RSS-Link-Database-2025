It is also a collection of high-performance data structures designed for efficient read and in-place/non-in-place write, with performance comparable to STL.  \n\nCustom allocators are used to keep fields in contiguous memory, enabling them to be sent directly. Offset pointers are used to maintain pointer validity after buffer resizing and memory movement caused by modifications to variable-size fields. Some other techniques, such as containers that support offset pointers and auto-resizing mechanisms, are involved.\n\nThe performance statistics demonstrate that XOffsetDatastructu",
