I could mention how i discuss some topics with AI and they will sort of chuckle or kind of seem skeptical of the information i provide which i got from those interactions with the models. </p> <p>I consistently have my questions answered and my knowledge broadened by these models. I consistently find that they can help trouble shoot , identify or reason about problems and provide solutions for me. Things that would take 5-6 google searches and time scrolling to find the right articles are accomplished in a fraction of the time with these models. I think the general persons daily questions and their daily points of confusion could be answered and solved simply by asking these models. </",
