Many disparate platforms issue alerts, but we have no good place to centrally work on those. We have pretty much all alerts going into Splunk, but the UI is not great for working alerts. The newest ES version has a decent investigations module, but it&#39;s a tough ask to get everyone on board.</p> <p>There was an attempt to put everything into Jira, but... Well it&#39;s Jira. Nobody likes it.</p> <p>There is no problem on our team creating integrations into other 3rd party platforms as we have many people who can script decently well.</p> <p>Anyone have suggestions for dedicated case management software? If free, great! If not, hopefully the features can justify the license cost! I looked at TheHive a few years ago, but I found it lacking. That&#39;s really as far as I got haha.</p> <p>Also, what are some tactics to use to get people behind a single management platform? Other than &q",
