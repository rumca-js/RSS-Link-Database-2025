A friend of mine warned me against using CDNs in production, but neither of us have much experience, so I wanted to get insights from more experienced developers.</p> <p>Are there any security, performance, or reliability concerns I should be aware of when relying on CDNs for these libraries? Would it be better to self-host them instead? If so, what\u2019s the best approach for managing updates efficiently?</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or best practices you can share.
