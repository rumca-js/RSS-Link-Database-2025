        "description": "Here's the full Assassin's Creed timeline, featuring all the Assassin's Creed games! Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows may be the latest game in the long-running AC series, but its feudal Japan setting places it at the midpoint of the AC games\u2019 historical timeline. That\u2019s because Assassin\u2019s Creed doesn\u2019t progress chronologically; this long-running franchise hops forwards and backwards in time between each entry, exploring significant events from as far back as the Peloponnesian War in Ancient Greece, and right up to the dawn of the First World War. \n\nWith 14 games in the mainline series and counting, the timeline of these events is increasingly complex. That\u2019s why IGN has pored over every scrap of Assassin's Creed lore to make sense of the series' centuries-spanning timeline, the overarching story, and how the games all fit together. The result is this AC timeline, including every Assassin's Creed game, which covers all the key events in the Assassin\u2019s Creed timeline in chronological order.\n\n",
