I used PINN to get dual boot options and I downloaded Bookworm with recommended applications, recalbox and batecera.</p> <p>The main OS works fine. However, I get a kernal panic when booting either of the other 2. I tried it without the m.2. drive plugged in (although it wasn&#39;t being detected anyway, but that&#39;s a whole other story). All three OS&#39;s were downloaded within PINN using ethernet connection. Also another minor issue, I can&#39;t seem to get PINN to connect to wifi, it said I need a wired connection, but i&#39;m seeing online that it can be used over wifi although I can&#39;t find this option on PINN</p> <p>Anyone know any troubleshooting tips? Don&#39;t really want to flash new software that replaces the main software as I spent a lot of time configuring it.</p> <p>EDIT: I&#39;ve managed to connect the M2 properly i think. The OS detects the storage which is good",
