The technology could revolutionise lunar navigation, aiding missions like Artemis. LuGRE had earlier set records for GNSS signal acquisition in deep space, reaching lunar orbit before its final touchdown. The data collected could help future spacecraft navigate autonomously, reducing dependence on Earth-based tracking. This achievement highlights the growing role of GNSS in space exploration, with potential applications extending to Mars missions.",

        "description": "A large network of ancient irrigation canals has been discovered in Iraq\u2019s Eridu region, dating back over 3,000 years. The system, with over 200 major canals and 4,000 smaller ones, was used to divert Euphrates River water to farms. Researchers traced the canals using satellite imagery and geological mapping. The findings suggest the canals were built in different periods and were not all operational at the same time. The region was eventually abandoned after the river shifted course, leaving behind a well-preserved archaeological landscape.",

By using iodine as an oxidant and removing residual impurities through ethanol washing, the polymers achieve superior porosity and CO2 adsorption efficiency. The study highlights their potential for gas separation, energy storage, and fuel cell applications. These findings could pave the way for innovative solutions in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving clean energy technologies.",
