The Guardian reports: Authorities in Comoros, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritius joined repeat offenders such as Burundi, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea and Kenya. Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania were also on the list. But perpetrators also included militias and other non-state actors. Telecommunication and internet service providers who shut services based on government orders are also complicit in violating people's rights, said Felicia Anthonio, the #KeepItOn campaign manager at Access Now, citing the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.\n \nThe details showed that most of the shutdowns were imposed as a response to conflicts, protests and political instability. There were also restrictions during elections. [...] At least five shutdowns in Africa had been imposed for more than a year by the end of 2024, according to Access No",

Phoronix reports: In addition to the native macOS ARM64 support and System.Windows.Forms improvements for X11, some of the other Mono 6.14 improvements carried out over the past half-decade include improved support for generated COM interfaces, many warning fixes, addressing common cases where processes would hang on exit, and more.\n \nAs for the \"Framework Mono\" name rather than just Mono, the release announcement explains: \"Framework Mono is the project previously hosted at https://github.com/mono/mono, which was then simply called Mono.

The next-generation Xbox console plans include a premium successor to Xbox Series X alongside Microsoft's own gaming handheld and new controller options with direct-to-cloud connectivity, the report said.

As Andreas Mindt, design chief at the company said, removing buttons was \"a mistake\". \n\n\"From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions -- the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light -- below the screen,\" he explained, adding: \"It's not a phone: it's a car.\" \n\nThis doesn't mean touch screens are set to disappear on new Volkswagens, just that drivers will now have the option of physical controls for their most used day-to-day tasks. The new controls are set to make their debut in the ID.2all, a small, budget EV set to debut in Europe.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Volkswagen+Bringing+Back+Physical+Buttons%2C+Says+Removing+Them+Was+a+Mistake%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftec",

AI-related listings account for 1.3% of all job postings nationwide.

        "description": "An anonymous reader shares a report: AI excels at following instructions -- but it's not pushing the boundaries of knowledge, says Thomas Wolf. The chief science officer and cofounder of Hugging Face, an open-source AI company backed by Amazon and Nvidia, analyzed the limits of large language models. He wrote that the field produces \"overly compliant helpers\" rather than revolutionaries. Right now, AI isn't creating new knowledge, Wolf wrote. Instead, it's just filling in the blanks between existing facts -- what he called \"manifold filling.\" \n\nWolf argues that for AI to drive real scientific breakthroughs, it needs to do more than retrieve and synthesize information. AI should question its own training data, take counterintuitive approaches, generate new ideas from minimal input, and ask unexpected questions that open new research paths. Wolf also weighed in on the idea of a \"compressed 21st century\" -- a concept from an October essay by Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei, \"Machine of Lov",
