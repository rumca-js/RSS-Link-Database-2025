Despite medical advancements, the country continues to have one of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the region. In 2020, an estimated 438 women per 100,000 live births died from pregnancy-related complications, according to the World Bank's Gender Data Portal. While maternal mortality declined slightly to 406 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022, progress has been slow, and maternal health challenges persist.",
