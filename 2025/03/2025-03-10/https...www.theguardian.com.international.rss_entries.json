        "description": "<p></p><p>The level will have to rise when Newcastle return to London with designs on ending their long wait for silverware this weekend. This scrappy performance is unlikely to have sent a shiver down Liverpool\u2019s spine before the Carabao Cup final, although there were positives for Eddie Howe to dwell on after his side boosted their hopes of Champions League qualification with a forgettable win over West Ham.</p><p>It was vital that spirits were lifted after the blow of exiting the FA Cup a week ago. The avoidance of further injuries was welcome and Howe could take satisfaction from a first clean sheet in over a month before Newcastle attempt to keep Mohamed Salah quiet. Liverpool, though, will presumably pose more questions than a cautious, limited West Ham attack managed here. Newcastle, who were clearly holding back at times, were comfortable after Bruno Guimar\u00e3es scored the goal that lifted them two points off fourth place.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/",
