I\u2019m new to linux and we are running on ubuntu, what we were trying to do with this is a 2 way sync with our google drive. The problem we are facing is that insync is running on a user session, so when I leave it running on my user it will eventually close and the sync will stop until I login again and open the app. How can I make this run all the time non stop? Is there a better way than to use insync? I have gone with insync for being easy to use, being new to linux I did not want to mess things up. But it isn\u2019t very fast even though our internet connection is quite good I believe.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Potato-Middle\"> /u/Potato-Middle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j7yrmw/insync_google_drive_always_running/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/",

Plus there&#39;s excellent integration for both KDE and GNOME.</p> <p>For what it&#39;s worth I&#39;ve only used Tumbleweed KDE since switching to Linux about six months ago and have only needed to use terminal twice.
