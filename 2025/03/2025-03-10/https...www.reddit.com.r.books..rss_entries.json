I realized I really wanted to explore more of the genre, specifically something less romance focused and with an ancient feel to the theming. So I decided to start with something reliable like Tolkien. I was hoping for a story I could completely sink into. The kind of experience that makes you feel like you\u2019re actually within the pages too and consumes your thoughts when you\u2019ve finally put the book down. So far the Hobbit has not done that for me. I\u2019m on chapter 9 and while it\u2019s silly and fun, I just don\u2019t really care much for any of it. The pacing feels quick and the storytelling very lighthearted. Is it worth it to move onto the lotr trilogy after this or should I move onto a different series? While I don\u2019t completely hate the Hobbit, I just don\u2019t know if I have it in me to continue this journey past this b",

But I&#39;m a little conflicted about getting rid of them. On one hand, it&#39;s pretty useless to own two of the same book, especially since the text is exactly the same (the special edition usually even has some more content). On the other hand, it just feels <em>wrong.</em> It feels like a waste of money that I bought those paperbacks, only read them once, and already get rid of them, while I might want to reread them, and some sentimental part of me doesn&#39;t want to throw out those books that gave me so many happy memories",
