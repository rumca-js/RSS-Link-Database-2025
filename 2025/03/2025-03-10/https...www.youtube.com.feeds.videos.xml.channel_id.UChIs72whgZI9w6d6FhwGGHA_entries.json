This includes some inventory level analysis to determine if the launch was a \"paper launch\" (it wasn't), some discussion over whether this is \"normal\" to have this much markup for partner models (it wasn't, but is becoming a new normal), and covers the pricing and availability situation of AMD's RX 9070 XT and non-XT GPUs.
