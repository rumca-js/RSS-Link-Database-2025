You\u2019ve probably heard it all before: a clique of supremely annoying twentysomethings convene for party girl Olivia\u2019s (Crystal Lake Evans) birthday, and head to music festival Blue Light. With the posse packed into her boyfriend Michael\u2019s (Jarrett Austin Brown) RV, Sarah (Amber Janea) and Gaby (Ana Zambrana) \u2013 Black and Latina respectively \u2013 wind up a couple of bigoted rednecks en route. And that\u2019s before the more cautious Carrie (Bella DeLong) and former marine Jason (John Bucy) ask for directions in the proverbial Backwoods Bar Where Everyone Stops and Stares.</p><p>Delivered in an overcranked performance style reminiscent of Sam Raimi\u2019s Evil Dead, there\u2019s something moreish at first about this tro",

As the guitars of the Cranberries\u2019 Dreams jangle, the film\u2019s two leads, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, leave their respective homes and walk through an autumnal-hued New York City with smiles on their faces, their characters unaware that earlier that morning they were anonymously exchanging emails.
