        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some conservatives are condemning the movement to pardon Derek Chauvin. They say that BLM will be mad if we pardon him. And, of course, we should never do anything that might make BLM mad. Also, a CNN commentator claims that Ukrainians are more American than Americans. A drag queen shows up to protest a law in Texas but only ends up proving why the law is necessary. And a woman on a reality TV dating show leaves her fianc\u00e9 at the altar because he isn\u2019t woke enough.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:24 Opening\n02:12 - 27:32 Don\u2019t Listen To The Emotional Blackmail Arguments Against Pardoning Derek Chauvin\n29:06 - 35:34 Consequences Are Coming For Libraries Who Host Drag Story Times\n35:35 - 44:32 MSNBC Guest Says Ukrainians Are More American Than We Are\n44:33 - 51:53 Francis Collins Belts Out Terrible Song To Protest Trump\n53:40 - 1:05:00 \"Love Is Blind\" Is Canceled\n\nEp.1552\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://x.com/robsmithonline/status/1897999423378219370\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/",
