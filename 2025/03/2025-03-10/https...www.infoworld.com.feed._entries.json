JavaScript taught the web to play. Well, not exactly but close enough. The programming language began in 1995 as a project in the depths of the browser maker Netscape. It lived under several different names including Mocha and LiveScript before it finally rolled out into the wild with the name <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3441178/what-is-javascript-the-full-stack-programming-language.html\">JavaScript</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aspirations were not grand.

Whether open source is \u201cgood\u201d and closed source is \u201cbad\u201d depends entirely on whether it helps developers and customers more effectively get stuff done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http",
