There is also a surprising lack of APKs available(I&#39;ve tried opening all APKs I could find from google onto Waydroid directly, but none of them worked). Maybe it&#39;s what is needed to run Brawl Stars? Google says that &quot;All client code <em>is</em> written in Objective-C and C++, and server code in Java.&quot; I don&#39;t know if I have to install Objective C or what its about(read something about GNUStep?)

However, it also raises a bigger question: could a, lets say a RyuJinx(RyuBing) Flatpak, deliver a standard solution?</p> <h1>The Issue</h1> <p>When pairing Joy-Con controllers via Bluetooth, they would connect successfully and even show up in Steam. However, when trying to configure them, they clearly dont work as expected. Switch emulators also failed to detect them, even though they were clearly paired.</p> <p>Since they worked partially in some programs, it was evident that this was a <strong>permissions issue</strong> rather than a driver or compatibility problem.</p> <h1>The Fix</h1> <p>The solution was to add the <strong>udev</strong> rule for Joy-Con controllers.
