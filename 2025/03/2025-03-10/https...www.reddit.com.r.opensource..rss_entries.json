I usually find these on Dribbble, Behance, and Uplabs. However, I only focus on the difficult or unique parts, not the entire design, since the rest is often basic and standard. </p> <p>So far, I\u2019ve kept my projects private to avoid any copyright issues, but I\u2019d love to start publishing them as open-source on GitHub to show how to replicate these challenging designs and help others learn from them. </p> <p>I have over 100 challenges in private so far, and I plan to keep doing more as I find new designs that push my skills further. I can\u2019t imagine UI designs that are a challenge and with good UX from scratch because that\u2019s really difficult for me, so my approach is to browse through hundreds of existing designs, find ones that look particularly hard to replicate, and then take on the challenge. </p> ",
