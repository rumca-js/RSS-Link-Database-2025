Mr. Rich has 70 billion by the way. A pittance in today&#39;s world of the richest. Not only that, but his claim to fame is he&#39;s never fired anyone before and he won&#39;t start now. All the bad guys want to fire people, and Richie wins over the public by making cuts in pay to the board members. How quaint!</p> <p>Some other fun points. Mr. Rich is played by Edward Hermann who goes onto play another famous rich Dad as Mr. Gilmore years later. All the fun elements of the movie land with my kids, especially having a McDonald&#39;s in your house and a roller coaster in your back yard. </p> <p>The most interesting thing to me though was &quot;Dadlink&quot;.

After I saw that it had won an academy award (and I had a sick day), I figured I would finally give it a shot. I have now stewed on the movie for a couple days and I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. I keep thinking about the floods I found myself in throughout life. And even more so the flood I currently find myself in, potentially losing my job (federal employee). I think about the feeling of first joining this team and how these animals have perfectly captured that feeling and the essence of some of my cohorts. Yes they may have their flaws, but we are all weathering this flood together now. We are all learning how to survive and go with the flow. This movie spoke to me in so many ways and I did so without ever uttering a word.
