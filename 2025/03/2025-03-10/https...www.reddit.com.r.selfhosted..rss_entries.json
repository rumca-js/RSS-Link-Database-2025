After trying to make it work inside of Homeassistant Frigate addon and failing, I finally gave up and setup the Frigate LXC. After going through that learning curve and getting it working, I realized that I will quickly run out of storage if I do not figure out how to mount my NAS. Let me tell you, there is no simple guide out there or nice users who just give you a step by step to follow. So after spending time playing around, I present you my github entry with either a manual guide to follow OR a simple bashscript that does a lot of the work for you minus some of the basic stuff like stopping the frigate service in the lxc and moving the existing data out of it so you can mount the proper directory. </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/irnutsmurt/frigate-lxc-nas-mount-\">https://github.com/irnutsmurt/frigate-lxc-nas-mount-</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

Bonus points if it has Siri support so I can change the vibes while I&#39;m driving.

I&#39;ve been using Tailscale to connect remotely to my homelab, and recently discovered the Tailscale funnel function to expose self-hosted services to the wider internet. So I thought, if I could expose nginx proxy manager via a Tailscale funnel, and have a Cloudflare CNAME point to the address of that funnel, would that work? Something like this:<br/> <a href=\"http://myapp.mysite.com\">myapp.mysite.com</a> as a CNAME record on Cloudflare, pointing to target <a href=\"http://npm.tailnetname.ts.net\">npm.tailnetname.ts.net</a> (the Tailscale tunnel exposing nginx proxy manager).
