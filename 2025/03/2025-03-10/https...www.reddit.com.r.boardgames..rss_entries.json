I&#39;ve mislaid my copy and want to pick up another copy, but can&#39;t remember the name or its publisher.</p> <p>The game was in an A5 box, I think, and was mostly a deck of cards and a few dice with an instruction booklet. From memory, you chose a commander, tank chassis and gun types and then did a solitaire game of fighting increasingly-powerful enemy tanks and mech-type things. You could get upgrades with the number of your tank guns or commanders. It had a Kickstarter I think. </p> <p>If anyone has any idea I&#39;d be hugely grateful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Skinny878\"> /u/Skinny878 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1j8b7lp/help_identifying_steampunk_tank_building_card_",

I&#39;ve never questionned it until lately, but can&#39;t find anything with that name on the Internet. So I figure it&#39;s either a homemade variant or it has another name. Here&#39;s who you play:</p> <p>- You play only with 2 players.<br/> - You take 1 pawn each that start at the skunk (90).<br/> - Each player play his own turn by himself. He draws and makes 4 hands of cribbage and a crib (he needs to put 1 card on each hand and the crib before being able to put a 2nd card and so on).<br/> - You then turn a starter and count how much points total you made with your 4 hands and crib.<br/> - The goal is to make at least 30 points. For each point over 30, your pawn goes forward 1. For each point under 30, your pawn goes back 1.<br/> - First one to the finish wins.</p> <p>Anyone know if this variant is legit?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",
