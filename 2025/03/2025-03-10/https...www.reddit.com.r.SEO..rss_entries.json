It&#39;s a very small online shop. </p> <p>One last thing to keep in mind. Sealed Pokemon TCG is highly competitive right now. There is high demand and low product.

The app is a coffee brewing guide, where you can select how you want to brew coffee, how much you want to brew, etc, and it gives you a ratio to follow along with a detailed recipe. </p> <p>The challenge I&#39;m running into with trying to get this to perform from an SEO perspective is that most of the text content is in the brewing recipes and instructions, but these only display when you select your method in the widget, which then hits the API to grab the content to display. So essentially, most of the &quot;juicy&quot; text that would normally help us rank just isn&#39;t there for Google to see. It can only see the text in the widget itself, which isn&#39;t super helpful. </p> <p>The widget is a block that I can display on other pages on our actual website, and I&#39;ve done so with more blog content surr",

I paid an agency to edit and manage the site I built strictly for SEO, and it shows. The good thing is that I rank pretty high in my local market. The bad is that the site is very sloppy and jammed with keywords. I think it can turn customers away, and that&#39;s why I built a new site. </p> <p>I just finished designing my WordPress site locally, and I believe I&#39;m ready to launch. I&#39;m very happy with the design and content, yet I haven&#39;t optimized it for SEO. I have used keywords as much as possible without sounding like a robot.
