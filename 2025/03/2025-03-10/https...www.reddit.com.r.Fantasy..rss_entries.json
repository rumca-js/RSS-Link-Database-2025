Please recommend me some scifi, post-apocalyptic, or fantasy set in the future (I&#39;m bad at genre distinctions, sorry!). </p> <p>The specific reason I&#39;m interested in this is because I just finished NieR: Automata and I really loved some aspects of it: unraveling mysteries of the past, things not being quite as they seem, religious and philosophical elements, deeper ideas about humanity, life, etc.</p> <p>Is there anyone who is writing series like Osten Ard and Elderlings, but in space? I&#39;ve already read Red Rising, Locked Tomb and the Children of Time trilogy, and enjoyed those.</p> <p>",
