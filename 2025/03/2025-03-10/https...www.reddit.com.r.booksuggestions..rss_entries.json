I am completely unfamiliar with his body of work, so I was hoping someone here could suggest an &quot;easy&quot; or shorter read, or if neither of those things, which of his works you feel is best representative of his world view and/or talent.

Surprisingly I looked at the books I studied in school with a sort of fondness. I&#39;m not one to usually read in my spare time and all of my friends dropped English, (as most 17 year old male teenagers do) but I realised that I might like reading. If a book is interesting to me I can, and will gladly sit through it. My parents made me get a library card when I was &lt;~7 and it hasn&#39;t been getting much use in these last 10 years so I thought id give it a shot.</p> <p>So far the most enjoyable books I&#39;ve read at school are &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. I really like books with different perspectives and various interesting themes. I can read Shakespearean English well and don&#39;t mind reading any Elizabethan texts however I haven&#39;t had much luck with Shakespeare as &quot;Hamlet&quot; was the only play I&#39;v",

I have unconventional taste in men and could use help finding stories with my type of characters / dynamics. </p> <p>I loooove pudgy characters, especially when they have gentle personalities. Neville Longbottom is the OG example since that&#39;s where it started, but Gomez Adams is another. You never see characters like this centered in stories and rarely do they fall in love. Gomez, being short, portly, and squash faced is a rare exception since he&#39;s often depicted to be more conventionally attractive. Him and Morticia are a good example of two characters having great chemistry and being deeply in love despite the public&#39;s conception of beauty standards. Sex appeal is all well and good, but it&#39;s nice when it isn&#39;t the focus.</p> <p>Some examples of characters I love, romantically or otherwise: - Neville Longbottom from Harry Potter - Samwise Gamshee from LOTR - Senshi from Dungeon Meshi - Tabitha from Pokemon Ruby - C",
