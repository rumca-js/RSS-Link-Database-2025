A lot of people are pushing back the technologies in the old days but it doesn&#39;t seem like XR as a whole was being &quot;detested&quot;. So what exactly is the issue of the influx of growth in XR? Here are the five things I think are the <strong><em>biggest barriers</em></strong>:</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Price point</strong>. Obviously, if you were to invest in a $3k - $5k headset, there better be something that&#39;s worth using. Unfortunately, PCs and Phones are besting the headsets at that price point. Even the cheaper end of the headsets is being bested by phones. Tough sell</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lack of publicity</strong>. Granted Meta is pushing hard for the Quests, but the flop of Apple&#39;s Vision Pro made quite a lot of advertisements go down the drain. It is either Meta or nothin",

Sure, there\u2019s <em>Resident Evil Village</em> or <em>Resi 7</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and a few others, but not enough to justify a purchase for me, especially since I\u2019m afraid support for it will dwindle over time.</p> <p>How big is the VR game library on PC that <em>officially</em> supports VR? <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is something I\u2019m interested in trying.</p> <p>For those who own a VR headset or the Meta Quest, do you use it often, or does the novelty eventually wear off?</p> <p>Also, are there any games that offer scenic experiences, such as roller coasters or virtual underwater worlds where you can simply enjoy the views?

The controllers were thrown away by mistake, the audio speakers were torn off after they stopped working. And the cable is so wrinkled that it sometimes needs to be connected a few times for it to start up windows MR.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to spend more then 500 for a new one, and it seems like my only options are these oculus quest headsets, the 3S &amp; 3. Since I\u2019ll mainly use it for Sim racing, is the upgrade even worth it? The odyssey has a lower resolution than both of these, but it\u2019s also an oled. I mainly don\u2019t play vr anymore because the headset is heavy and the cable is stiff, and setup software is horrendous. Is this a viable upgrade? Even with the compression that comes from using USBC for connection, and/or the wireless option?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

I haven&#39;t even played a game on my pc for the past 4 weeks. Mostly playing DoE, Breachers, Iron Rebellion, and just recently picked up Underdogs.</p> <p>So I&#39;m searching for VR games almost everyday to see what&#39;s out there. But I&#39;m honestly surprised there&#39;s no knock off arcade light gun games from the 90s and early 2000s like Virtua Cop or Time Crisis. I feel like these could THRIVE on VR. Especially (maybe there is but I haven&#39;t looked) if there&#39;s a company that makes controller add ons with haptic feedback. I know there&#39;s Augmented VR games but they all seem kind of cheesy and not quite the vibe of what a light gun game has.</p> <p>I know there&#39;s boxing games but after playing Underdogs and absolutely LOVING it. I feel like a Reel Steel robo boxing game would be huge if done right. </p> <p>The",
