There\u2019s too much traffic, they buffer and shut down repeatedly. Are there any alternatives?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been seeing people buy a super box and you get access to free UFC pay per views, but it seems too good to be true.

Some years ago, I got a dmca letter from my isp about a torrent I allegedly downloaded. To give some context, I was downloading directly from an adult website (paid sub at the time.. I know lol) but never from a torrent. Nevertheless it spooked me enough and I haven\u2019t downloaded adult content since. My question is: if I downloaded from a ddl tube website (eporner/porntrex) using a vpn, what would the risk of getting a dmca notice be? Located in Canada if that makes any difference. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/incog_nico\"> /u/incog_nico </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1j804qk/question_dmca_vpn_nsfw/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1j804qk/question_dmca_vpn_nsfw/\">[comments]</a></spa",
