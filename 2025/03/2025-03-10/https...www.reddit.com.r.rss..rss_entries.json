Many high-ranking civil servants regularly share useful resources, advice, and information that&#39;s relevant to my studies.</p> <p>My problem is that my LinkedIn feed is becoming overwhelming, and I&#39;m struggling to keep track of all these valuable posts among the regular LinkedIn noise. I&#39;ve been wondering:</p> <ol> <li>Are there any built-in LinkedIn tools or filters that would allow me to focus specifically on content from these civil servants?</li> <li>Is there a way to export/convert my LinkedIn feed (or parts of it) into an RSS feed that I could then filter more effectively?</li> <li>Do any third-party tools exist that might help me organize and track specific content types from LinkedIn?</li> </ol> <p>Any advice would be greatly",
