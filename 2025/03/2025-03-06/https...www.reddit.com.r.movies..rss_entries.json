For me, it was The Pursuit of Happyness. The way it explored the struggle of never giving up, even when life is constantly knocking you down, changed the way I view perseverance and resilience. I honestly didn\u2019t expect to get so emotional over it.</p> <p>So I\u2019m curious \u2013 which movie had a similar effect on you? The one that changed your perspective or made you see the world a little differently? Let\u2019s hear those life-altering cinematic experiences! \ud83c\udfac\ud83d\udca5</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spare_Ad6800\"> /u/Spare_Ad6800 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j4lqdi/what_movie_totally_changed_the_way_you_look_at/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j4lqdi/what_movie_totally_changed_the_way_you_l",
