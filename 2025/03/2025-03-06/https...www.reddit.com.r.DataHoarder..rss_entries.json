Everything is running fine but I was reading a post on here where someone was asking to get talked out of buying 2 of them. Everyone was shitting on seagate drives and it got me worried.

I&#39;ve spent some time searching and have seen people replace the fan wall with 3d printed components to use 120mm/140mm fans or even replace the 80mm fans.</p> <p>I am curious from those who have done this, do your drives stay cool and are you getting enough air flow?
