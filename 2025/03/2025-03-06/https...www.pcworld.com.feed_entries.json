Amazon is selling this Pixio 27-inch 1440p OLED for $499.99 with a $100 on-page coupon, no Prime membership needed. That brings the final price to (tap tap tap, carry the one\u2026) four hundred bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a solid $200 less than even budget-tier OLEDs outside of the big annual sales events, and it matches the cheapest price I\u2019ve ever seen for a new OLED monitor (back during Black Friday last year). And unlike a lot of the more affordable OLED models, this Pixio OLED has a few premium features, including a speedy 240Hz panel, USB-C video with 65 watts of charging for laptops, and an integrated KVM switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure",
