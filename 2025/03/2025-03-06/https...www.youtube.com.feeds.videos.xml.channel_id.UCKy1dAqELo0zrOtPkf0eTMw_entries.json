        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nHBO's The Last of Us Season 2 will be dropping soon, but fans of the franchise hoping for a Part 3 of the game might be waiting a long, long time. Like forever. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently told Variety that a Part 3 may never happen. However, Part 2's TV adaptation will go on for at least two seasons, so fans have that to look forward to. In other news, Marvel 1943's Black Panther recently let slip the game's tentative release window: Christmas 2025. While an official release date hasn't been given, a holiday launch doesn't seem too unreasonable. And finally, Nintendo just won another major lawsuit, this time against counterfeit Amiibo sellers. Nintendo and Amazon teamed up to take down sellers peddling Amiibo cards and other devices that mimic Amiibo functionality. Nintendo won with a judgement of $7 million, but since none of the accused responded to the lawsuit, we're not sure how Nintendo is going to collect.",
