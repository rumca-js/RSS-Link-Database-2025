Some months ago it started becoming unreliable. Eventually maybe 3-4 games in I would get insane constant stuttering. I basically just reboot into windows and I play as long as I like.</p> <p>Behaviour I see:<br/> If I don&#39;t move the mouse or press a key then stuttering stops. The moment I add input it will start stuttering again instantly.<br/> I can even replicate this behaviour in a kill cam.<br/> - So if I die and just watch it (screen moves around new things pop in to render) then I get smooth constant frames.<br/> - If I die and I mouse the mouse at all in the kill cam (note my mouse movements do nothing to affect the view as it&#39;s first person to the other person moving) I get the same massive stuttering.</p> <p>I&#39;ve noted a few people also seem to have issues on protondb.

It feels &quot;off&quot; to me. I was immedietly in love with Mint from the moment I launched it. However it has no inherent gaming support. So I went to various search engines, YouTube and Reddit to figure out what to do. For future reference for myself and maybe others I am collating everything in this document. However as a Linux novice there are likely mistakes or contradictions. Some guides say to stick to Flatpak, others say to avoid them. Its very difficult to figure out what&#39;s what. So I tried to piece together what makes &quot;sense&quot;. I would love to hear some more experienced Linux users opinions on this and any mistakes I made or improvements to the guide. Or maybe there is another guide I simply haven&#39;t found? Thank you. </p> <p><a href=\"https://codeberg.org/Chaosmeister/LinuxMintGamingSetupGuide\">https://codeberg.o",

People always talk about the normal game (Battle Royale). However, I have a particular use case. I don&#39;t play BR at all. The only game I play is a custom map, Miner Tycoon. Most of the time, I&#39;m just afking it while hitting some specific goal. </p> <p>My question is: Does the anti-cheat also affect <strong>custom maps (even if I&#39;m playing in a private lobby)</strong>? I don&#39;t care about performance or being able to play online with other people, but I&#39;d like to be able to have the map farming for me while I&#39;m working on my thesis, which is done in Linux, and I don&#39;t want to have to use WSL for it since I&#39;m trying to move",

May update or make a new post once I try even more distros. </p> <p>Initially I tried Kubuntu. Maybe the stable release would have worked fine (I used 24.10), but I was running into problems with it. Installing steam was hassle. Once finally installed, it would only launch using CLI and only after initial install. Every other time it would not launch. I also had an issue where I would set display scaling because I have it hooked up to a large TV and the settings would just revert to original 100%. Overall not a great experience. Did not manage to run a single game. Surely others have had success and I&#39;m sure with enough effort I would have been able to get it going too. </p> <p>Installed No",

Some hiccups, but everything eventually smoothed over.

For example, Marvel Rivals loads at around 100 FPS, but once I get to the title screen that displays one of the heroes, it drops to 30, as well as while in a match. Monster Hunter: Wilds is a complete no-go at sub-10 FPS the entire time. (Confirmed by Steam overlay FPS counter this time.)</p> <p>However, this only lasts until I put my PC to sleep and wake it up. Then, when I boot up Marvel Rivals, it shoots up to 144 FPS and stays there, and I hang around 60 on MH:Wi",
