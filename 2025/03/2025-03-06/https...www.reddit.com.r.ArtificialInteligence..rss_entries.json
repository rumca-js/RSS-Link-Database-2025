It started with YouTube algorithms just reacting to inputs and analyzing patterns, but over time, it\u2019s become an invisible force shaping what we see, think, and engage with. Call it what you want, but AI has been here for a while, learning our patterns, optimizing for engagement, and making us more reliant on it. It doesn\u2019t have a mind of its own, but it\u2019s still driving human behavior in ways we don\u2019t fully understand. Instead of letting it keep tightening its grip on our psyche, we should flip the script. What if AI wasn\u2019t just an engagement trap, but a reasoning tool, something that detects and exposes manipulation, breaks us out of information loops, and helps us think more clearly instead of reactively? We should acknowledge what AI already is, and build it into something more. Something that doesn\u2019t just feed impulses, but helps people escape meaningless engagement cycl",

In a nutshell, you bypass the problem of not trusting the translation in a language you don&#39;t know, by <em>using the LLM to translate it back</em>. By careful prompting, you get a very literal backtranslation which will hopefully reveal any clanging errors.
