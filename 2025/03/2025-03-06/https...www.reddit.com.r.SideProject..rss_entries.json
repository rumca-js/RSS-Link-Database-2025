The concept came from a need for beautiful dresses for special events, but not wanting to purchase a new one each time. Our options thus far have been to either purchase a new dress or rewear an old one (nothing wrong with this). However it\u2019s my feeling that women have dresses in their closets that haven\u2019t seen the light of day in months or years. I want women to be able to clothes swap / rent clothing from one another. </p> <p>We\u2019d start out with special event attire, perhaps also pregnancy clothing and Halloween costumes.

And yeah of course there is and that&#39;s where my idea was born as a lil side project. So the idea is to help small businesses be able to manage their orders from social media accurately and that&#39;s by simply using Google Forms, Google Sheets and a little coded function which I created to help sending notification to the business owners via email once an order is filled in Google Forms by their customer.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m playing Ulli! Instead of picking every game upfront like a traditional bracket, Ulli lets you make new picks each round\u2014but once you choose a team, you can\u2019t pick them again. The challenge? If three of your teams lose, you&#39;re out! This survivor-style format keeps the excitement going all the way to the Final Four, making every pick strategic. Plus, you can compete with friends in private groups, track live rankings, and even chat and trash talk along the way. It\u2019s free to play, and we\u2019re looking for people to check it out before the tournament starts.

I am an experienced full-stack dev, but I&#39;d never developed any Chrome extensions before. So, I made CheckMate.</p> <p>This started off as a side project on which I was spending hardly ~2 hours per day (a bit more on weekends). It surely seemed a bit tricky in the beginning as I tried to figure out the Chrome runtime API and the difference between background and content scripts. But I nailed it, nevertheless. </p> <p>I soon realized that I can just use my preferred tech stack to build this extension. Which made the process a whole lot easier (and enjoyable) for me.</p> <p>Soon enough, I really started to enjoy working on this and felt like I wanted to turn this into an actual, working, polished piece of software.
