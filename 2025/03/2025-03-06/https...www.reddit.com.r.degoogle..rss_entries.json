Sure there was 5 and 1 star ratings and everything in between.

Its always pending for a few seconds, then moved to status &quot;not posted&quot;.</p> <p>So I closed my Google Account recently and deleted everything because its not trustworthy in my eyes. I used this account rarely and never wrote a mail with it- just for Maps.</p> <p>For me it looks like many Company&#39;s and Restaurants and so on get rid of the low ratings and Google supports them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NoStepOnSnep\"> /u/NoStepOnSnep </",

Google really wants to get rid of powerful adblockers like uBlock Origin in order to sneak more ads and tracking into their services, especially YouTube. I know Firefox, but I won&#39;t switch to that browser. I recognize that it&#39;s a solid alternative to Chrome, but I don&#39;t like it. I tried, but I never adapted to it\u2014I just don&#39;t like the way it looks and works, which is simply a matter of personal taste. Also, the Firefox extensions ecosystem seems smaller than that of Chromium-based browsers. So, I just want a reliable Chromium-based browser that will support Manifest V2 or at least revert Google&#39;s changes in Manifest V3 so that it can work reliably with any adblocker, and, of course, without the controversies surrounding ads, tracking, and data collection.</p> </div><!-- SC",

For years, I naively stored everything there\u2014photos, documents, game assets, illustrations, you name it. By the time Google notified me that they were deleting my account (and all 20TB of data with it), I was in full-blown panic mode.</p> <p>I had one year to migrate <em>everything</em>.</p> <p>The process was a nightmare. Converting Google Docs to .docx or PDFs, downloading terabytes of data, and figuring out how to store it all. At the time, 4TB hard drives were expensive, so I ended up with a janky setup: a &quot;NAS&quot; (if you could even call it that) built out of my gaming PC, with a PCIe USB hub to connect a bunch of external drives. It was a mess, but it worked\u2014sort of.</p> <p>That experience ",
