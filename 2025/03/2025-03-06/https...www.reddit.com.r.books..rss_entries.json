I&#39;d had <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em> read to me as a kid but wasn&#39;t a fan when I actually came to read them myself in my latish teens. It wasn&#39;t the prose or plodding pace some people complain about, the narrative and atmosphere just didn&#39;t click with me. I finally tried again a few years later, and this time LoTR in particular very much clicked for me. My tastes hadn&#39;t changed much but, without getting into politics, the sense of rising dread early on and general feeling (in my interpretation anyway) of the world clearly going very wrong but too many people who could act not doing their part gave me what I can best describe as a long series of mental <em>&#3",

I&#39;ve started with Iron Flame, and I&#39;m enjoying it a lot.</p> <p>I should start by saying that I had no expectations when I decided to read Fourth Wing. I came in almost completely blind, and I was pleasently surprised.</p> <p>Most of the characters are well defined. One knows exactly what to expect from them. This is something I really like. I despise books with bland characters, but I like these characters a lot. Even the villains. I of course don&#39;t like them, but I appreciate them for the role they are taking, and I understand their motivations.</p> <p>As expected from YA fiction, the main character is a young woman trying to find her place in life. As someone who hasn&#39;t read many YA fiction books or romantic books, I find this completely normal and expected. And I don&#39;t find this trope annoying. Or some of the derivative plot points either. Tropes or tropes for a reason. People want them in books.</p> <p>I&",
