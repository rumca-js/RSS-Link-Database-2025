I\u2019ve since read almost all of Emily Henry\u2019s books and am looking for some great recommendations based off this. It can be spicy or not but I don\u2019t like YA and don\u2019t like romantasy. I like sad romance as well and like when the characters have some sort of trauma.

No shame to romantasy enjoyers but I keep picking up books with cool premises for them to only be romantasy and that&#39;s just not my jam. I just prefer romance as a subplot, I feel it&#39;s more rewarding. Anyway, some series I have read and enjoyed are An Ember In The Ashes, The Lunar Chronicles, Fable &amp; Crier&#39;s War. I love a good rebellion/corrupt society that has a bit of action!

I know they aren&#39;t similar, so sorry if I&#39;m being vague!
