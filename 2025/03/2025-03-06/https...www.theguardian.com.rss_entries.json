These are secret agent dramas that give us the violence and the tech, juxtaposing suspected treason and infidelity in the traditional way, but with a new kind of workaday realist sexiness, and more elaborately about showing up for work: much emphasis on ID badges of various security-clearance levels that beep on card readers and can be worn round your neck on lanyards.</p><p>Steven Soderbergh\u2019s downbeat, affectless tongue-in-cheek spy comedy (\u201ccaper\u201d isn\u2019t quite right) is in this ne",

In 1616, when the English physician William Harvey corrected this misconception and explained how the heart works, the audience at the Royal College of Physicians booed him. Why did it take so long for scientists to understand the heart\u2019s real function? One possibility is that until the invention of mechanical pumps in the late 16th century, doctors lacked the metaphorical language to describe what the heart does.</p><p>\u201cThe truth of the body is as much about storytelling as it is about anatomy,\u201d the writer and surgeon Gabriel Weston argues in Alive, an unusual and gripping book that she describes as an \u201cecumenical exploration\u201d of her subject.
