And with the end of Windows10 in sight, and a very motivational video called &quot;How I broke up with Adobe&quot; I figured now is as good a time as any. And I come here looking for advice.</p> <p>As an introduction, I am a graphical artist, and enjoy my gaming. As such, I am not the best with coding and commands. I have tried ArchLinux before a couple of times on my Raspberry Pi, but have never quite been able to get fully accustomed with the Terminal. I&#39;d still be happy to learn, but having a GUI alternative to operate and soften the blow would be wonderful.</p> <p>So, not really understanding Linux, I have no clue what I am really looking for when it comes to distro hopping. I&#39;ve been looking into &quot;Mandriva&quot;, &quot;Mint&quot; and... well, &quot;Arch.&quot;</p",

We successfully signed in two, but now any further attempts fail. Local accounts are fine, and only the two that were previously successful can sign in now. We suspected maybe it was something failing when it was trying to make the home directory, since that seemed to be the only difference, but logging in as an admin and doing sudo login as a different domain user did create the home directory for that user and at the very least got into the shell as that account. However, even after it created the directory, the account was unable to login to the desktop. Said account also can&#39;t log into the machine via ssh, but that&#39;s probably unrelated.
