Multidimensional array-type data structures are commonly used in robotics applications such as RGB and depth images, as well as occupancy grids for navigation. While these alone present a compelling alternative to hand-rolled data structures, this talk will illustrate the flexibility of the layout and accessor policy customization points included in std::mdspan, demonstrating its potential through various examples, including helping a robot arm inventory beer bottles.\n\nThis talk will review conventional use cases of std::mdspan in robotics, such as occupancy grids and submaps for determining obstacles and collision checking with polygonal footprints, as well as handling cam",
