In the UK, Sony has partnered with leasing company Raylo for this, with plans covering 12-, 24-, and 36-month terms.</p><p>Plans start at \u00a311/month for the PS5 digital slim model with a 36-month lease, and scale up from there for shorter lease durations. Leasing a PS5 Pro, meanwhile, starts at \u00a319/month for 36 months, scaling up to \u00a327/month for a 12-month lease. Sony also offers monthly rolling leases that allow players to cancel any time, but these are considerably more expensive (\u00a336/month for the PS5 Pro).</p><p>This doesn't appear to be a rent-to-own program.
