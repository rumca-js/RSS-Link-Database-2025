Due to the recent winner of the Oscars being an indie movie, Flow, I desperately want to watch it on certain platforms. However, I feel bad pirating indie movies as indie studios have less money and resources than other studios, e.g. Disney, Dreamworks, Paramount, etc. So, I feel like I shouldn&#39;t pirate indie movies until a year has passed from its release. For indie games, I have pirated a lot of indie games, however, some indie game developers are more respectable towards pirates, e.g. Just Shapes and Beats, and Ultrakill, so there is some morality to it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JimXJustbecause\"> /u/JimXJustbecause </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1j504pf/opinions_on_pirating_indie_movies_games_etc/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1j504pf/op",

Most recent one being my younger sibling. She\u2019s a huge Taylor swift fan and she had released some documentary of the tour and my sister couldn\u2019t watch it anywhere. Toh I taught her the ways, things like what is p2p architecture, qbittorent and vpn and stuff.
