        "description": "Learn PyTorch and PyTorch Syntax from @OmarMAtef. This course walks through five hands-on exercises designed to help you understand and apply PyTorch syntax in real-world tasks. It starts with tabular data classification, then moves on to image classification using both custom and pre-trained models. You'll also explore audio classification and text classification using BERT, giving you a well-rounded introduction to PyTorch\u2019s capabilities. \n\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/omaratef3221/pytorch_tutorials\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive learning: https://scrimba.com/freecodecamp\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n0:00:00 Tabular Data Classification\n1:31:13 Image Classification\n2:47:49 Pre-trained Models - Image Classification\n3:38:31 Audio Classification\n4:52:31 Text Classification\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e Drake Milly\n\ud83d\udc7e Ulises Moralez\n\ud83d\udc7e Goddard Tan\n\ud83d\udc7e David MG\n\ud83d\udc7e Matthew Springman\n\ud83d\udc7e Claudio\n\ud83d\udc7e Osca",
