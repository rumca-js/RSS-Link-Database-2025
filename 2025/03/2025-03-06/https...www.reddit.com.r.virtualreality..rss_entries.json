Right now my plan is to see what is the highest refresh rate I can use per game without reprojection at 1.4x resolution, then I&#39;ll test again with my new card to see if I can go up a refresh rate. I&#39;m just going to sit for a minute in a scene and watch the fpsvr output on my controller. Is there a way to set a minute timer and have it auto output missed frames and reprojection or do I have to eyeball it? I&#39;m okay with doing a rough estimate but it would be nice if I could create a little more detail. I tried searching but only got vr readiness tests. </p> <p>To upgrade my graphics card I have to remove and repaste my cpu cooler so I&#39;m not going to keep switching back and forth to test.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CANT_BE",

Is it good enough to also enjoy pc vr games? are the graphics going to compare at all to a headset specifically designed for pc? I also heard about compression and am wondering if it&#39;s noticeable on quest 3 on cable or air link. </p> <p>If it matters i have powerspec g444 and im specifically wondering about how the quality of skyrim vr pc/ blade and sorcery pc would be through quest 3 via linking. </p> <p>I am open to buy other headsets that aren&#39;t portable but don&#39;t want a super expensive one.

Been really enjoying Dungeons of Eternity and then I heard of Legendary Tales being a PS/PCVr game. Then I read up on how Meta is essentially price gouging them and it opened my eyes to how other devs are probably treated money wise and made me really not want to support games on meta and would rather pay for them on steam etc.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been reading up on Wifi 6e and setting it up and what not. Haven&#39;t bought a router yet but does running 6e with Airlink make the quest 3 play like it&#39;s physically linked? I tried playing steam vr with my regular wifi and it was incredibly janky.
