I\u2019m hoping you can help me understand session authentication with Django+DRF a little better.</p> <p>For context, my application is using Django+DRF as a backend API. I\u2019m using Astro (mydomain.com) to fetch data from Django (api.mydomain.com) and render the UI. Generally, this has seemed like a nice match, but (session-based) authentication is a little more complex than I thought.</p> <p>Specifically, it\u2019s tricky to manage CSRF and session ID cookies when I\u2019m fetching data with Astro\u2019s server-side rendering. For example, I\u2019m having to manually pass some \u201cSet-Cookie\u201d headers from Django to Astro after users log in.</p> <p>This got me wondering about a pattern to gracefully ask users to login again after their session cookie expires. My app is a classifieds site, so users might be in the middle of creating or editing their content when their cookie expires whic",
