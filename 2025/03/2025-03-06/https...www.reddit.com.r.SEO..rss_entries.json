Then, he said if I&#39;m satisfied, we will start a contract to move forward with other issues I need fixed. </p> <p>I&#39;ve never hired anyone for this type of work before, so I&#39;m curious how I can make sure I&#39;m making the right decision when hiring someone. He has nothing but stellar reviews on fiverr but it still makes me nervous. Is it possible for him to put something on my website?
