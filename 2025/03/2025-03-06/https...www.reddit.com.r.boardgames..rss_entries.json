We\u2019re more used to strategy games that allow for long-term planning, so adjusting to a more luck-driven, unpredictable style took some effort.</p> <p>That said, we pushed through, and by the third chapter, everything finally clicked. The mechanics started to feel more intuitive, and we realized how easy it was to catch up, even if you scored little to nothing in the early chapters. The game ended in the fourth chapter when one player pulled off a wild 20-point play, and that was the moment we almost wished we had more time, even after spending two and a half hours getting there.</p> <p>Thematically and visually, Arcs does a great job, but some of its mechanics feel overdone.
