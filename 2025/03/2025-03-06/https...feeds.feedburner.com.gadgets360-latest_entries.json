This massive bolt extended nearly 50 miles into the atmosphere, likely originating from a thunderstorm near New Orleans. The image, later discovered in NASA\u2019s archives, highlights an unusual lightning event that travels upwards instead of striking the ground. Scientists estimate that around 1,000 such events occur annually, though most remain undetected.",

Managed by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the instrument captures high-resolution thermal infrared data, identifying temperature variations across wildfire-affected areas. Experts believe this could help firefighting agencies detect smoldering fires that might reignite. With further testing, c-FIRST could be used in future satellite missions to enhance global wildfire monitoring efforts.",
