Also typical DnD races and high magical worlds are welcome too. Just a good old adventure-type with likeable and well-written characters, journeys and a fun fantasy world. Doesn&#39;t even have to be medieval-inspired, it too can lean into steampunk or so.</p> <p>I&#39;ve watched the anime Frieren twice so far and it reminded me of my love for &quot;classic&quot; fantasy media that feel fresh. Absolutely loved the mix of a fun journey and world, slice of life, philosophy, loveable characters and action. </p> <p>Also I like cozy fantasy and Japanese fantasy with yokai, and I like dark stuff too. The Witcher series and Attack on Titan come to mind, also the second arc of BG3 was my favorite. </p> <p>I just grew tired of too much political intrigue, war-themed, or low fantasy that is scared of using magic and &quot;too many&quot; fantasy elements.

I found a new itch I need to scratch and that\u2019s a dark fantasy book where the main character is very skilled at killing and is one of the strongest in the world and morally gray. Also he was once a dedicated believer to his God but has turned his back on God due to an awful experience and become somewhat a nihilist but secretly is a great guy. Also love monster hunters and gods playing a role in the story if not characters themselves. I\u2019ve read the Witcher up to the 4th book and love that series and I keep hearing about malazan but just am not ready to commit to such a long series but will get to it one day.
