Both M4 MacBook Air models are\npriced $100 less than their predecessors: $1199 for the 15-inch\nmodel and $999 for the 13-incher. If I\u2019m not mistaken, this is the\nfirst time that the new-generation design of MacBook Air\nintroduced with the M2 chip has been available at the classic $999\nprice at launch. (The M1 Air, based on the Intel-era visual\ndesign, debuted at $999, but the M2 Air debuted at $1199 and only\nreached $999 when it was offered as an older model alongside the\nM3 Air.) As of now, the M4 Air can hold down the sub-$1000 price\npoint all on its own, and previous models are mostly discontinued.</p>\n\n<p>Another surprise is the the new color option: Space Gray is out.\nThe ultra-dark-blue Midnight remains, as do the classic Silver and\nhint-of-champagne Starlight. The new color is Sky Blue, which\napparently is a metallic light blue that really shows itself as a\ncolor gradient when viewed ",
