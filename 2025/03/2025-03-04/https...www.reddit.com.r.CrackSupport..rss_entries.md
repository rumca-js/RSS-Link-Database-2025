<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I open The Sims 4 and select ‘Start Offline’ (since I don’t have the online version), I get an error message that says: ‘The contents of your user data directory were created by a newer version of The Sims 4 and cannot be loaded.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve installed a cracked version of Ark Ascended and tried getting into mods. After some errors I finally got them to work, except mods like Primal Chaos or Dino Overhaul X 2. The dinos simply don&#39;t spawn and I do not have engrams from either of the mods. Primal Chaos worked the first time, but as I got on the next day, everything was simply gone. I&#39;ve tried: putting them as the number 1 priority, running the game with only that mod, reinstalling the mod, reinstalling the crack, in the meantime I even had to clean my hard drives and reset my computer, ofc I hoped that would fix it, but sadly nothing worked. I&#39;m interested if anyone else has had a similar problem and how they fixed it.</p> <p>Btw, I only play singleplayer, if that means anything..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucian_M2213"> /u/Lucian_M2213 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I’m trying to set up <strong>CS:GO for offline LAN play</strong> (pre-CS2) without Steam, but I ran into some issues.</p> <p>I first downloaded a <strong>&quot;Full Edition Repack&quot; with 7Launcher</strong>, but it <strong>didn’t work at all</strong>—the game wouldn’t even start. The PCs I’m using have <strong>no internet connection</strong>, so I need a version that works <strong>completely offline</strong>.</p> <p>Now, I found <strong>CS:GO v1.36.2.0 (No-Steam, Offline, Multi) on Archive website</strong> and I’m hoping it supports LAN play properly.</p> <p>Will this work? or is there any other version you suggest or what torrent file you recommend as well?</p> <p>Would appreciate any advice from people who’ve done this before! Thanks! 🚀</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZiKoZzZz"> /u/ZiKoZzZz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1j2ylr6/best_cs
