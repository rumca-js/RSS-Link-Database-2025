First 30 days are free and 20% off the annual premium subscription when you use our link \u279c  https://brilliant.org/sabine. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Microsoft made a big splash in the media by claiming that they\u2019d found a way to build a scalable quantum computing platform which could reach one million qubits in a short period of time. They claimed this was possible with the help of a type of topological qubit called Majorana states. But it appears there are several\u2026 issues with the company\u2019s published research. I have a quick summary.\n\nThe video with the comments from Sergey and Vincent is a one hour long discussion which you can watch in full here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ag-L3hZiXo\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c ",
