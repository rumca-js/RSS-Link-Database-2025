In ideal circumstances, paper documents became web or mobile forms, and workflows replaced handoffs. However, many paper-based documents were converted to digitalized versions in PDF, Microsoft Word, or some other document format. Organizations then invested in document processing technologies to help extract structured information from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-AI document processing technologies were often primitive, relying on rules and patterns to identify and extract information. These processors were reasonably accurate in extracting basic informa",
