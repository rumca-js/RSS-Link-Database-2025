<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a 6700 XT and it&#39;s starting to struggle in some games mainly because of really bad fps drops. The drops sometimes go down to 17-20 in games like Hogwarts Legacy and Marvel Rivals for example. It&#39;s still a great card but I bought it back in 2021 and thinking of upgrading while this card still has some value. I am debating on a 7800 XT or a 7900 XT. The brand new cards don&#39;t interest me mainly because of stocking issues. I play on Bazzite with a 5600x pair with a 6700 XT at the moment. I do distro hop from time to time to see what updates have been released on distros like Nobara and Cachyos. I am not against Nvidia just feel AMD would be better cause I am staying on Linux.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TumbleweedAdvanced24"> /u/TumbleweedAdvanced24 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j3o3wy/which_gpu_to_upgrade_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So for the past month I&#39;ve had a proper good go at migrating over from Winblows to Linux for mostly gaming and web development purposes.</p> <p>Before I list my points below, here is some important context:</p> <ul> <li>GPU: Nvidia 4090</li> <li>CPU: AMD 7800X3D</li> <li>I&#39;m using CachyOS (after first starting with Ubuntu, then Fedora and settled on CachyOS)</li> <li>My usage is from the angle of primarily gaming at high / ultra settings, and Web Development via IntelliJ IDE. More specialist things such as 1password for SSH key management, VPN etc.</li> </ul> <h1>The good</h1> <p>The last time I tried this was about 5 years ago. Since then, a LOT has changed on the Linux landscape, for the better. Generally speaking, I do believe Linux is on the pathway to really pull away gamer-but-also-developer types like me, as even right now Linux is a fairly good experience for gaming, and obviously an ideal experience for web application development.</

I&#39;ve closed it down to Bazzite and CachyOS but I&#39;m not sure wich one to choose so here are my thoughts: CachyOS is Arch based wich means the kernel is more current wich is helpful since linux gaming is evolving fast. On the other side I see more people recommending Bazzite, wich also seems to have better driver support preinstalled and is in general more gaming optimized. </p> <p>Anyway I need a few other opinions so if you used one of them or maybe both, please tell me what else is good/bad about these Distros. </p> <p>Have a great day and thanks for your help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KHTD2004"> /u/KHTD2004 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j3fzzl/bazzite_vs_cachyos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1j3fzzl/

My experience with PCs was relatively limited overall before 8-9 months ago. I had a couple Intel core 2 duo gaming laptops way back in the day that struggled to run oblivion.

Windows 11 leaves much to be desired. Double so on a handheld PC. And Bazzite was great! I shortly after decided to buy a desktop PC and get a pr
