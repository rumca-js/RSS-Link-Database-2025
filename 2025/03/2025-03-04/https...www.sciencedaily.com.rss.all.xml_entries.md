The puzzle of predicting how three gravitationally bound bodies move in space has challenged mathematicians for centuries, and has most recently been popularized in the novel and television show '3 Body Problem.' There's no problem, however, with what a team of researchers say is likely a stable trio of icy space rocks in the solar system's Kuiper Belt.

Researchers have created a system to help beekeepers monitor and analyze the health of their beehives and take corrective actions to prevent colony collapse -- when a majority of the worker bees abandon the colony and its queen. Beehives use thermoregulation to ensure the hive temperature stays between 33 and 36 degrees Celsius, about 91 to 97 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, bees might cluster to create insulation when it's cold or fan their wings when it's hot. But when beehives experience external stressors, such as pesticides or unexpected weather events, they lose the ability to regulate the hive temperature.

A vivid new image is taking shape in the world of cell biology: Imagine bacteria adhering to the surface of a cell, perhaps at the site of an injury or wound. In response, a white blood cell arrives at the scene. This cell encircles the pathogen with its membrane, forming a tight, constricting ring. With remarkable force, the white blood cell yanks the pathogen off the wound's surface. The white blood cell then engulfs the pathogen in a process called phagocytosis, in which it 'eats' the foreign invader to neutralize it.

Results from a phase 1/2 clinical trial of a novel stem cell treatment for cornea injuries found 14 patients treated and tracked for 18 months had a more than 90% success rate at restoring the cornea's surface and improvements in vision. The procedure, called CALEC (cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells) involves taking stem cells from a healthy eye, expanding it into a graft over several weeks, then transplanting it into a patient's damaged eye. The groundbreaking procedure was developed to help people with injuries like chemical burns that lead to irreversible limbal stem cell deficiency, and the researchers hope the new findings warrant additional trials.
