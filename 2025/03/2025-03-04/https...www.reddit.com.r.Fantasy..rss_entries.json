I don\u2019t find the characters very complex or compelling, the world building is very tell-y, the writing is artless, the dialogue forced, and the attempts at witty banter are painful. The mysteries feel more like cards that haven\u2019t been flipped over, rather than like a puzzle that hasn\u2019t been solved. The plot somehow manages to be intricate without being complex or nuanced, resulting in a tedious and largely unsatisfying read so far, and even for a slow burn, of which I am a fan, the pacing is slow.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, this may sound weird, but I&#39;ve recently found that one of the things I most enjoy about (especially medieval) fantasy books is learning about how the political systems work, how the bureaucracy works, the different magistracies, the officers, the inner-politics of court, etc. I do enjoy action, of course, but reading about how the politics <em>actually</em> work, rather than just the King or Emperor doing it all without nuance, is fascinating to me.</p> <p>Therefore, I was wondering if there are any series or books that have this? I think the closest I&#39;ve found is probably ASOIAF with the Small Council and its officers; The Dagger and the Coin with the focus as well on banking; and The Goblin Emperor with the secretaries and protocol. I would prefer if it&#39;s closer to the two first, so something a bit more grimdark, but I&#39;m not too fussed. Any ideas?
