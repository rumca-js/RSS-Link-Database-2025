Both are probably obscenely expensive these days.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The weekly Tuesday Review Thread is a great place to share quick reviews and thoughts on books. It is also the place for anyone with a vested interest in a review to post. For bloggers, we ask that you include the full text or a condensed version of the review but you may also include a link back to your review blog. For condensed reviews, please try to cover the overall review, remove details if you want. But posting the first paragraph of the review with a &quot;... &lt;link to your blog&gt;&quot;? Not cool.</p> <p>Please keep in mind, we still really encourage self post reviews for people that want to share more in depth thoughts on the books they have read. If you want to draw more attention to a particular book and want to take the time to do a self post, that&#39;s great! The Review Thread is not meant to discourage that. In fact, self post reviews are encouraged will get their own special flair (but please remember links to off-site reviews ar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently started the Stormlight Archives, my first Brandon Sanderson experience. I’m about 1.5 books in. I really wanted to like this series, as it came highly recommended from a friend, everyone seems to like it, it’s a huge epic which I usually love, and I dig fantasy. </p> <p>But I’m just not into it. I don’t find the characters very complex or compelling, the world building is very tell-y, the writing is artless, the dialogue forced, and the attempts at witty banter are painful. The mysteries feel more like cards that haven’t been flipped over, rather than like a puzzle that hasn’t been solved. The plot somehow manages to be intricate without being complex or nuanced, resulting in a tedious and largely unsatisfying read so far, and even for a slow burn, of which I am a fan, the pacing is slow. After listening to over 70 hours of book, I feel like everything that has happened or that I’ve found out would comfortably fit in a single 20-30 hour bo

## Medieval Fantasy series with focus on bureaucracy/political system?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, this may sound weird, but I&#39;ve recently found that one of the things I most enjoy about (especially medieval) fantasy books is learning about how the political systems work, how the bureaucracy works, the different magistracies, the officers, the inner-politics of court, etc. I do enjoy action, of course, but reading about how the politics <em>actually</em> work, rather than just the King or Emperor doing it all without nuance, is fascinating to me.</p> <p>Therefore, I was wondering if there are any series or books that have this? I think the closest I&#39;ve found is probably ASOIAF with the Small Council and its officers; The Dagger and the Coin with the focus as well on banking; and The Goblin Emperor with the secretaries and protocol. I would prefer if it&#39;s closer to the two first, so something a bit more grimdark, but I&#39;m not too fussed. Any ideas? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red

## Fantasy series that has well done romance, but it's a subplot. I'm not looking for romantasy, I want it to be centered around action/adventure but have a little tasteful romance in it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a 30 something man, and I would be lying if I didn&#39;t say I like some romance in my fantasy. But I want to be something that is both well-done, and not the main focus of the story. I hate when stories just go from 0 to 100 with the relationship, I want some development, where it goes slow and steady and eventually culminates in something good. But I <em>also</em> want it to take a backseat to the actual plot, not BE the plot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlashSnoopy"> /u/FlashSnoopy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j2yegm/fantasy_series_that_has_well_done_romance_but_its/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1j2yegm/fantasy_series_that_has_well_done_romance_but_its/">[comments]</a></span>
