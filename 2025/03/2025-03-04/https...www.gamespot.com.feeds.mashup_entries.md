<p dir="ltr">Two years ago, Wizards of the Coast and Square Enix announced a collaboration that would bring the worlds and characters of Final Fantasy to Magic: The Gathering, the tabletop card game juggernaut. Recently, WotC gave us our first look at some of the cards included in the set, which ranged from expected faces like Cloud, Tidus, and Terra to wackier inclusions like Jumbo Cactuar and its 10,000-damage ability.</p><p dir="ltr">The set is still three months away, but based on reactions to the first handful of cards revealed, both WotC and Square Enix are leaning on this set to be a massive success.

<p>Bungie has announced the upcoming arrival of Rite of the Nine, a limited-time Destiny 2 event centered around three of the space shooter's dungeons.</p><p>The dungeons featured will be Prophecy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-spire-of-the-watcher-dungeon-guide/1100-6509966/">Spire of the Watcher</a>, and Ghosts of the Deep. They'll rotate weekly throughout the event's duration. Three modes - Ultimatum, Explorer, and Eternity, will affect the way players experience each dungeon. Players will be working towards a high score, and that score is calculated on how often you die. Stay alive as much as possible, and your score will be higher. That score will determine how good the loot drop is at the completion of each encounter. "We're challenging you to go into this harder mode and not just execute, but execute in a way that gets you a higher score, better rolls, and in the Ultimatum mode, Adept versions," Bungie explained.</p><p>Ultimatum mode is for players who a

<p>When Donald Trump was running for reelection in 2024, he constantly spoke about his desire to add tariffs--or import taxes--on America's trading partners and rivals. Now, President Trump has gone through with that threat by imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The Chinese tariffs are on top of the 10% tariff that Trump ordered on the country last month. Taken together, this new round of tariffs may spell trouble for physical video games, according to an industry analyst.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ljkknpfsa22x">shared his belief</a> that physical video games that would be subject to these tariffs may simply not be made.

The new mode allows players to choose from two heroes as voted on by their team, letting players hit the field as one of them. This means that you can field an entire team of Iron Men or Venoms, and some of the other combinations here are <em>wild</em>.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6465741" data-src="/videos/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-game-mode-trailer/2300-6465741/" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="0">          <iframe height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen id="-embed-903199340" class="optanon-category-C0004" data-src="/videos/embed/6465741/"></iframe></div><p>For example, imagine if everyone is playing as the Punisher--a scenari

<p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/">as it deals with its financial issues</a>.

Capcom also fixed an issue that could cause the game to force-quit and addressed an issue where the weapon equipment skill would be mistakenly activated when using a mantle.</p

## Absolum Is A Fantasy Roguelike Beat-'Em-Up That Looks Great And Plays Even Better

<p dir="ltr">While the genre isn't as prolific as it once was, beat-'em-ups still tend to follow in the mold of Final Fight and Streets of Rage: You're a muscle-bound mayor or a martial arts expert or occasionally a mutated turtle, and you roam the streets left-to-right beating up punks and punching trash cans to find turkey dinners. Absolum, the latest from veteran studios behind Streets of Rage 4, promises a fresh roguelike twist alongside an inventive original fantasy setting, and the result is a remarkable blend of influences and mechanics that left me wanting more.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum is the first original franchise from Dotemu and its co-developers, Guard Crush Games and Supamonk, and it's immediately clear that the studios have thought deeply about how to breathe new life into the classic formula. While you do still move from left to right taking on bands of assorted enemies as you go, the newly-coined "rogue 'em up" variation means you're expected to fail out of levels an

<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for me, Split Fiction is the type of game you feel utterly compelled to tell your friends about. It's the type of game that will have you setting your controller aside to wipe away tears, both of laughter and raw emotion, as well as to call literally everyone in close proximity to come see whatever dark, hilarious, referential, or mind-blowing thing just happened. As such, I've spent the better part of the past week impatiently waiting for this embargo to drop--for the second I could talk about it with someone other than the close friend I roped into joining me. In short, Split Fiction is one of the most memorable, brilliant, and spectacular games I've ever played. And at long last, I am allowed to tell <em>everyone </em>about it.</p><p dir="ltr">With Split Fiction, Hazelight Studios solidifies itself as not only one of the most clever and innovative working studios, but as one eager to grow and utterly devoted to creativity as both an idea and act.
