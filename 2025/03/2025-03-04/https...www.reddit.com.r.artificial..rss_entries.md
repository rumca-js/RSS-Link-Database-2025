<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I&#39;ve created a custom vision project to analyze images of pottery sherds. I have three tags, with each tag associated with about 325 photos. I made an Android application on Android Studios that uses the exported TensorFlow lite model integrated with Java. When tested, the trained model works well on the custom vision website, but the accuracy is significantly worse on the Android app. I am using the same testing images. I used the metadata properties file provided when exporting to match my image preprocessing method as precisely as possible. I&#39;d like to know which direction I should take my troubleshooting next. Any input would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdammitCam"> /u/AdammitCam </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1j3o14r/how_can_i_keep_the_accuracy_of_my_custom_vision/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Below is a copy and paste of what I said to someone, but I wanted to note. If someone really doesn&#39;t believe me that art in Hollywood is long dead, and we should ignore Hollywood fearmongering about AI replacing them. Look at pirating sites. What I said below should hold extremely true because it shows you the true demand of the people. Not some demand because you paid x amount, and by damn you will get your money&#39;s worth. Or you are limited to what that theater or service does. Since pirating servers are a dime a dozen and 100% free to use. If you have old stuff in the trending, there is a problem.</p> <p>Anyways, I am posting this here because when you run into someone who legit thinks AI is killing art. Even more videos.
