This directory gets created sometime after the container is started, and before the container is marked as healthy. I need to manipulate a file in this directory as part of the startup process, or immediate after the container is actually up.. I&#39;ve tried using a <a href="http://entrypoint.sh">entrypoint.sh</a> script which waits until this is in place before running a command, but it just sits there and waits and the container never starts, and i&#39;ve tried running this in the background (wait for the dir then run this command), but that also fails to produce the desired results. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for other approaches to this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --
