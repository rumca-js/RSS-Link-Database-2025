Hazelight Studios’ latest co-op adventure, Split Fiction, releases March 6 th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. The follow-up to 2021’s Game of the Year dazzles on the gameplay front but wavers a bit when it comes to its storytelling. 

The plot centers on two aspiring writers as they get sucked into their own stories through an unprecedented simulation. This premise allows for a wide variety of gameplay styles: from top-down bullet hell sequences to sword-based melee brawls, to some truly outlandish puzzles. 

The game particularly shines with its Side Stories, small isolated levels exploring even more creative ideas than the rest of the game. If you can tolerate the chatty characters and generic isekai plot, there’s a lot of good co-op action to enjoy here.

Whatever your thoughts on Monster Hunter Wilds' story, the difficulty, etc., everyone can unanimously agree that a Monster Hunter title really begins in the endgame. However, for those new to the franchise, the question is - What exactly do you do after finishing the story?

While it's not exactly the most robust action RPG endgame out there, Wilds offers a healthy amount of content. Tempered Monsters are the main targets, but multi-monster Investigations can also be rewarding. You can dig into Artian Weapon crafting, forging your ideal arsenal and reinforcing it further (with randomized bonus stats each time).

Maybe you want to craft all the Rarity 8 weapons and min-max your set-up when fighting specific monsters. Leveling up armor is also a significant investment, especially when Heavy Armor Spheres aren't easy to come by. Of course, nothing stops you from kicking back and engaging in fishing or finding the slickest fashion for your hunter.
