        "description": "The automotive industry has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with a growing focus on software-driven innovations. However, this shift has also introduced new challenges, particularly in terms of software fragmentation. \n\nHistorically, automakers have relied on different computer hardware running different operating systems and software platforms for each model year, resulting in a fragmented landscape. This approach has led to increased costs, complexity, and difficulties in managing software updates. \n\nAs Dan Cauchy, Executive Director of AGL at the Linux Foundation, explains, \u201cAGL was created to alleviate that problem by creating a single platform that everybody builds on top of.\" By providing a standardized software base, AGL enables automakers to focus on developing their unique features and services, rather than rebuilding the underlying software for each model year.\n\nInitially focused on infotainment, AGL now includes instrument clusters, heads-up displays",
