<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years ago, I tried Brave but didn’t like it. I can’t quite remember why, but something felt off. Recently, I decided to give Brave another shot and installed it on all my devices. The experience has been really positive, especially with the built-in ad blocker, which even works on iOS devices.</p> <p>One thing that really stood out to me is how active the development of Brave is. The project is clearly alive and thriving on GitHub, with a large number of active contributors and users. It’s reassuring to see that the browser is constantly being updated and improved.</p> <p>However, I did encounter a couple of bugs:</p> <ol> <li>If your default search engine isn’t Google, the “Translate Selected Text” option is missing from the menu. You can only translate entire pages.</li> <li>After adding a few languages to the spellchecker list, I kept seeing a “failed to download” message. I tried various fixes, but what worked was copying the language files

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically I use the avast secure browser and lately its been kind of buggy, by that I mean if I for example switch to a different search window in avast it will sometimes kind of half switch or ill have like certain points of the one I switched to and the one I was on. anything I do is doing on the new search window but I cant see half the stuff and then at some point it will fully switch to the new search window. Also if I like click a text box and once I am done typing and I exit the text box and try to for example scroll down it shows like the full screen scrolling in that small text box. My explonation is really bad and I apologize for that, but when I tried taking a video using obs and tried to add it here everything on the recording looked normal even though I know it wasnt. Also I tried other browsers and it does the same thing. If you know the solution or have had the same problem please help! TY :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted
