<p>Dan Moren, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most consequential part of the Air’s update — perhaps the
<em>only</em> real update — is the M3 processor, which brings with it
GPU-based capabilities like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and
video encoding and decoding for ProRes and ProRes RAW.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the Air is basically unchanged: it comes in 11-inch and
13-inch versions, features the same cameras, battery life, the
exact same dimensions, and the same accessory compatibility as its
M2-based predecessor. It even comes in the same colors — Space
Gray, Blue, Purple, and Starlight — at the same prices starting
at $599.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A true speed-bump update — no big whoop, but it’s good for the platform for devices to get regular speed-bump updates in between major new revisions. The previous M2 iPad Air models only came out in May of last year, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/05/brief_thoughts_and_observations_on_yesterdays_let_loose_ipad_k

<p>Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is committed to being transparent about government requests
for customer data and how we respond. We publish a Transparency
Report twice a year disclosing the number of government requests
for customer data Apple receives globally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s most recent report for the United States covers January to June 2023. They didn’t use to lag this far behind. In November 2021 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/08/apple-transparency-report-covering-h2-2020/">they issued the report for the second half of 2020</a>, so that report came out 11 months after the period it covered. In September 2023 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/15/apple-latest-transparency-report/">they issued the report covering January to June 2022</a>, 15 months after the period covered. For all I know, they’ll come out with the report for the second half of 2023 sometime this month, continuing to lag 15 months behind the reporting periods. But if that’s the stand

## iFixt’s iPhone 16e Teardown

<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, writing for iFixit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But it’s still missing MagSafe, for no obvious reason other than
making the phone less appealing to consumers than the rest of the
16 lineup. Wireless charging without the perfect alignment that
MagSafe allows is troubling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been waiting for iFixit’s teardown to see if removing MagSafe components might help explain the 16e’s physically larger battery. It doesn’t seem to. The 16e battery seems taller, not thicker, and the MagSafe components in an iPhone 15 don’t seem thick or space consuming.</p>

<p>The 16e did garner a 7/10 repairability score — very high for an Apple product from iFixit. But their party line is that you still shouldn’t buy one, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108337/why-a-refurbished-iphone-might-be-better-and-cheaper-than-a-brand-new-iphone-16e">opting instead for a refurbished older iPhone 14</a>. Refurb iPhones are great, and they’re popular for a reason, but it f

## The Free Speech Will Continue Until Trump’s Morale Improves

<p>President Donald Trump, on his very popular bespoke social network (random capitalization and various typos <em>sic</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or
University that allows illegal protests. Agitators will be
imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they
came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending
on on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS! Thank you for your attention
to this matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Trump, both he and his supporters keep claiming, represents the party of free speech. Got it.</li>
<li>There <em>are</em> going to be widespread protests against Trump and his policies. Large protests were rampant in his 1.0 administration; they seem almost guaranteed in 2.0. Trump and his cronies feel entitled to act lawlessly and chaotically, with little regard for the law and no regard whatsoever for traditions and norms, while expecting those who disagree with them to keep quiet 

## Claim Chowder: October 2022 Rumors Regarding the iPhone 16e (a.k.a. ‘SE 4’)

<p>Hartley Charlton, writing for MacRumors in October 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fourth-generation iPhone SE will feature a 6.1-inch LCD
display and a “notch” cutout at the top of the display, according
to Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good call on the size and notch, but the 16e display is OLED, not LCD. Overall, though, I’ll award Young a Being Right Point for this call from 2022.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moving to an all-screen design, there will no longer be space for
a capacitive Touch ID Home button in the device’s bottom bezel.
Multiple reports, including information from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/22/iphone-se-3-feature-xr-design-touch-id-last-lcd/">MyDrivers</a> and
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> suggest that Apple is planning
to add a Touch ID Side button to the iPhone SE, much like the iPad
Air and iPad mini.</p

<p>Chance Miller, writing last week at 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise-ambient-sounds/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> developer Charlie Chapman is out with a new Mac
utility <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6636520519">called “Framous.”</a> The app aims to be the best way
to add device frames to screenshots. [...]</p>

<p>Here are the ways Framous aims to streamline this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-detect your device based on your screenshot to pick the
right frame from a growing library of devices</li>
<li>Combine multiple devices into a single image, or bulk export
multiple separate images at once</li>
<li>Quick customization options to change frame colors and more</li>
<li>Automate your screenshot framing with Shortcuts support for even
more efficient workflows</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a bunch of ways you can add device frames to screenshots like this, but none as clever, fast, and easy as <a href="https://apps.appl

## Another Tim Cook Product Announcement Teaser on X: ‘There’s Something in the Air’

  <p>The same tagline from Apple’s 2008 announcement for the original
MacBook Air.</p>

<p>On the cusp of that announcement at Macworld Expo, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/08/01/11/apple_hoists_theres_something_in_the_air_macworld_banners.html">AppleInsider photographed a bunch of banners with that slogan</a> Apple had hung inside Moscone West. I swear I’m not making this up, but a bunch of people were speculating that the big announcement would be a deal with Adobe to bring Adobe Air (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/air2months/">their still-in-progress next-gen Flash platform</a>) to the iPhone (which was just over six months old).</p>
