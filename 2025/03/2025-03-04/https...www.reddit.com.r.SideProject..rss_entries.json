My first is Utilio, a set of unlimited-use tools like an image compressor, PDF compressor, QR code generator, and more, completely free for anyone to use. I got tired of hitting usage limits and paywalls with similar tools, so I built Utilio to fix that for myself and hopefully others too. It&#39;s simple, yes, but I wanted to start with something that wouldn&#39;t be overwhelming as the first project. </p> <p>My motivation for this task (10 side projects this year) is that I want to ditch my 9-5 before my newborn arrives later this year. These projects are my attempt at freedom, being able to spend time doing what I love, and of course be able to spend time with my new born. I\u2019m excited to test if they can get me there.</p> <p>Check out Utilio at <a href=\"https://utilio.co/\">https://utilio.co/</a> and let me know what you think!",

Also, it was fun to play around with some AI apis.</p> <p>The outcome was Screen2Code, an app that let\u2019s you turn any mobile UI screenshot into modular code. Currently supported are SwiftUI, Flutter, Jetpack Compose and React Native.</p> <p>The outcome even impressed me and I actually use it by myself too. It\u2019s quite handy when having handoff enabled and just copy the code from your iPhone to your mac\u2019s clipboard.</p> <p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/screen2code/id6742195394\">https://apps.apple.com/de/app/screen2code/id6742195394</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Saltibarciai\"> /u/Saltibarciai </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1j3a7ak/screen2code_transform_screenshots_into_code/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1j",

Just post and you&#39;re guaranteed eyeballs on your product, no need to filter through all the noise as there is none (4 other people launched with us). Would be great if this number was higher but happy with it from just a few graphics and reusing old promo content.

During that time I build websites, products, integrated analytics tools, built AI products and apps. I learnt so much. But there is one more thing. I was able to observe what is going on there from the inside. I noticed one thing. Founders do not have time for their main product/service! So much other stuff - legal, finance, marketing, fix on the website. </p> <p>This should not be done be them! Startup founders are here to innovate! That&#39;s pretty common issue nowadays. That&#39;s why I decided to take a step, and try to free them up a little bit - decided to create studio, were we will help busy founders in landing page/website creation &amp; management - everything from design to development. </p> <p>My mission? To help startups innovate even more, so we can live in even better world. For the start, if anyone needs consultancy, talk about their website, ",
