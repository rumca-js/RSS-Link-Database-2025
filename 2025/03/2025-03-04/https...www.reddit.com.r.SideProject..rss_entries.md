<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I’m on a mission to build 10 side projects this year to see if they bring enough income so I can quit my job. My first is Utilio, a set of unlimited-use tools like an image compressor, PDF compressor, QR code generator, and more, completely free for anyone to use. I got tired of hitting usage limits and paywalls with similar tools, so I built Utilio to fix that for myself and hopefully others too. It&#39;s simple, yes, but I wanted to start with something that wouldn&#39;t be overwhelming as the first project. </p> <p>My motivation for this task (10 side projects this year) is that I want to ditch my 9-5 before my newborn arrives later this year. These projects are my attempt at freedom, being able to spend time doing what I love, and of course be able to spend time with my new born. I’m excited to test if they can get me there.</p> <p>Check out Utilio at <a href="https://utilio.co/">https://utilio.co/</a> and let me know what you think!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/SideProject">r/SideProject</a>, wanted to share something I’ve been tinkering with—Your Daily Minute. I’m a solo dev who got fed up with feeling scattered, so I built this app to record 60-second video reflections each day. The idea was simple: dump my thoughts in a minute, no fluff. Then I nerded out and added some AI to analyze it—picks up stuff like ‘you’re wired on Tuesdays’ or ‘you sound fried after 8 PM.’ All on-device, no creepy cloud stuff.Coded it in React Native with TypeScript—took a few months of late nights to get the AI sharp. Been using it myself for a bit, and it’s weirdly addictive—seeing my own patterns laid out is a wake-up call. Launched it with a subscription model to keep it sustainable, but honestly, I’m still figuring out how to get it in front of people who’d vibe with it.Any other makers here mess with personal growth tools? How do you push these kinds of projects past the ‘cool, I built it’ phase? Open to br

While that was a win, I realized I was making things harder for myself than necessary.</p> <h1>How I Used to Build:</h1> <ul> <li>I’d come up with a cool idea (yes, I write down my ideas 🤓)</li> <li>Immediately start building, without much research</li> <li>Try to validate as I went</li> </ul> <h1>What I Do Now:</h1> <p>Instead of coming up with brand-new ideas and trying to validate them from scratch, I <strong>focus on projects that already have proven demand.</strong></p> <p>I now look for existing products that are already making
