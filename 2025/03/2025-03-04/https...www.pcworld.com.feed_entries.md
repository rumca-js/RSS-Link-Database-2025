<p>Not many locations exist—just 28 stores across the continental United States. But a 29th has been slated to open in Santa Clara, California, and those of us in the San Francisco Bay Area have been antsy about this homecoming. That wait will be soon over: This morning, my colleague Mark Hachman got the first hint of an opening date: <strong>May 2025</strong>.</p>
