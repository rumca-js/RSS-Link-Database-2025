They are ok if done correctly. But in general I find that it needlessly puts a lot of pressure on me and distracts from the real interview - asking each other questions about our respective work. </p> <p>I wish it wasnâ€™t industry standard to make people jump through hoops in the interview room.

Letâ€™s see how you like it when someone slaps a dirty keyboard in front of you, opens up some weird webpage, and tells you to type some code now.</p> <p>Are there any other
