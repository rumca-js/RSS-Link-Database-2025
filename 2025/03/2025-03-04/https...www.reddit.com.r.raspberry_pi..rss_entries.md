<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got a free 55&quot; TV and decided to make a digital movie poster and when I booted up the Pi 4, it filled too much of the screen. Underscan/Overscan didn&#39;t change a thing after editing it in the config.txt file so I just decided to try to rotate it because it didn&#39;t really matter. I found a tutorial that said to add the line display_hdmi_rotate=1 and display_rotate=1 but it would get stuck launching.
