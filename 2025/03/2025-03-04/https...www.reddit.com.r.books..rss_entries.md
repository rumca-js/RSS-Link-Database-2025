## The Teacher (McFadden) & My Dark Vanessa (Russel)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read The Teacher (2024) about a month ago and it was my first McFadden book. I thought it was an easy read and I liked it enough to read it in two or three days. However, I&#39;m now reading My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russel (2020) and I have to say that McFadden basically copied every major plot line of this book and even minute details, such as professions, actions of characters, specific books and poems. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see a word-for-word copied sentence or paragraph. Vanessa is deeper and has more meaning and less of a &quot;whodunnit&quot; feel and hits darker elements of the teacher/student relationship and is more well written in my opinion, but still the similarities are irrefutable. Has anyone else read these books and come to the same thought? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OGAnimalCrossing"> /u/OGAnimalCrossing </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>How did I end up here, you may ask?</p> <p>I wanted to read The Midnight Club. I&#39;m a fan of Mike Flanagan&#39;s, I love retro and vintage looking covers, I love second-hand books. But what I&#39;ve found was The Last Vampire bind up and nothing else, so I got it. I&#39;m guessing my book is pretty old, since the series were rebranded into Thirst and my cover is orange.</p> <p>Reading this after slowly going through Vampire Chronicles is wacky. The main character&#39;s POV is Lestat x200, but she&#39;s also a hot...teen? Between the two books, Sita (the main character&#39;s name) claims she&#39;s either stuck in eighteen or twenty, which isn&#39;t a big difference. But even in the most crucial of moments she never fails to mention how acute her hearing is and how powerful or beautiful she is. Sure, there&#39;s a couple of dudes to rival her strength, but if she&#39;s not mentioning her abilities, there&#39;s always Krishna.</p> <p>I might be dumb.

THE PLOT TWIST MAKES NO SENSE???? if you haven’t read the final book, it’s centered around harry and ginny’s second son, albus, and draco’s only son, scorpius. without getting too into it, albus and scorpius try to go back in time with a time turner to prevent cedric diggory’s death after overhearing amos berating harry for being the one who lived (hehe pun intended). during this time albus, and the rest of the potters and weasleys, meet delphine. she’s the care taker of amos and is coincidentally his niece, aka cedric’s cousin. </p> <p>albus and scorpius turn to delphine for help because she’s older and wants cedric to survive as much as they do, so she helps. NOW HERES WHERE THE PLOT THICKENS. </p> <p>delphine claims to be the child of bellatrix lestrange and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong><em>Review-</em></strong> This was a <em>middle of the pack</em> book for me. The story was good, it just didn’t grab me the same as the books I’ve really liked but also didn’t give me anything to dislike about it. </p> <p>My favorite parts of this book were: <em>1.)</em> the FMC, she was written so well. <em>2.)</em> The romantic mishaps, adored them. And <em>3.)</em> <strong><em>The General’s</em></strong> little side story arc. The General is Misty’s cat, I quite literally laughed out loud while reading. <em>4.)</em> The build up of what I believe to be a future series. (Which I am frothing at the mouth for… it won’t be the next series she releases if i read the authors note correctly.)</p> <p>Also, Talia Rhea is amazing at writing her characters. It feels as though she has lived their life prior to writing about it. All her characters are full beings, and it comes across that way in text. <em>(I’ve read my fair share of authors that write

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was one that I kept telling myself I wouldn&#39;t enjoy or get into. I was recommended this book and was told &quot;just read the first one&quot;. So, to see what all the fuss was about, I complied.</p> <p>I was shocked with how much I actually enjoyed this book. The character arcs, the world-building, the plot. I loved it. I don&#39;t usually read romance books and really don&#39;t enjoy fantasy (or so I thought). I said I would only read the first one but since finishing it I can&#39;t stop thinking about Feyre and the other characters and what is going to happen next.</p> <p>I get the hype.</p> <p>EDIT: I&#39;m not saying this is the best book in the world by any means, just that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I am trying to read more books outside of genres I tend to gravitate towards and Romantasy/Romance-Fantasy was up there. I expected to absolutely hate it, and I didn&#39;t. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <
