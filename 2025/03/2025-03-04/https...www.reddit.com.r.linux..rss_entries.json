I&#39;ve looked up different ways and I found Andronix and UserLAnd. It seems like Andronix hasn&#39;t been getting support lately, even though it seems to have a more modern UI, so I am thinking of trying out UserLAnd, which has been updated and has good reviews still. Is there a major difference between the 2?</p> <p>Are there also other ways to use linux with a desktop gui with linux I am unaware of?</p> <p>Thank you for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/needgoodluckpls\"> /u/needgoodluckpls </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j2zmy9/difference_between_andronix_and_userland_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j2zmy9/difference_between_andronix_and_userland_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",
