<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2616121/microsoft-makes-quantum-computing-breakthrough-with-new-majorana-1-chip.html">Microsoft’s Majorana 1 chip</a> is billed as the company’s first <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3574488/what-is-quantum-computing-solutions-to-impossible-problems.html">quantum computing</a> processor. The excitement surrounding this million-qubit dream, with its unique architecture and reliance on exotic materials like indium arsenide, seems like a watershed moment in computing history.</p>



<p>Yet, as someone deeply entrenched in the realities of enterprise IT architectures, I find myself skeptical. For all the grand promises of what quantum computing co

<p>One of the earliest digital transformation drivers was digitalization, in which organizations converted paper-based processes to digitized workflows. In ideal circumstances, paper documents became web or mobile forms, and workflows replaced handoffs. However, many paper-based documents were converted to digitalized versions in PDF, Microsoft Word, or some other document format. Organizations then invested in document processing technologies to help extract structured information from them.</p>



<p>Pre-AI document processing technologies were often primitive, relying on rules and patterns to identify and extract information. These processors were reasonably accurate in extracting basic informa

<p>Teradata is adding vector support to its platform in the form of a new Enterprise Vector Store, an in-database offering, to enable and augment use cases that require retrieval augmented generation (RAG), such as agentic AI.</p>



<p>Other features of Enterprise Vector Store include vector data management starting from embedding generation and indexing to metadata management and intelligent search.</p>



<p>It also supports frameworks such as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2334784/what-is-langchain-easier-development-of-llm-applcations.html">LangChain</a> and planned temporal vector embedding capabilities, which is designed to aid explainability by tracking changes to data over tim
