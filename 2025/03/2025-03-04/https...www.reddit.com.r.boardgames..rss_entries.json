Most of the time I prefer to find solo games.</p> <p>So I&#39;m not sure what to do when game ends. I haven&#39;t had anyone yet send a chat or message. Seems like it could get repetitive or meaningless to keep saying &quot;good game&quot;. Often I just leave by returning to the main menu but that seems a tad rude. I wouldn&#39;t do that if playing face to face.

What are some of the strategic ways that you guys use this potion? l&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a good way to clear a track of a color you don&#39;t really need or a good way to possibly consolidate all of the marbles of one color that you do need to possibly get them in a big chunk down the line.

I remember my stepmom having some American relatives and they were the ones who introduced us to it.</p> <p>I think it was fantasy-themed, maybe it had wizzards? The board consisted of 4 sections, all positioned next to each other. The game started out with the two outer sections folded in, so they had &quot;game space&quot; on both sides. Both outer sections had holes in them. You first played the &quot;folded in&quot; board, and at some point your &quot;character&quot; could jump through the hole in the middle of the section ",
