## Show HN: Time travel debugging AI for more reliable vibe coding

<p>Hi HN, I'm the CEO at <a href="https://replay.io" rel="nofollow">https://replay.io</a>.  We've been building a time travel debugger for web apps for several years now (previous HN post: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28539247">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28539247</a>) and are combining our tech with AI to automate the debugging process.<p>AIs are really good at writing code but really bad at debugging -- it's amazing to use Claude to prompt an app into existence, and pretty frustrating when that app doesn't work right and Claude is all thumbs fixing the problem.<p>The basic reason for this is a lack of context.  People can use devtools to understand what's going on in the app, but AIs struggle here.  With a recording of the app its behavior becomes a giant database for querying using RAG.  We've been giving Claude tools to explore and understand what happens in a Replay recording, from basic stuff like seeing console messages to more advanced analysis of Re

## Show HN: Vidformer – Drop-In Acceleration for Cv2 Video Annotation Scripts
 - [https://github.com/ixlab/vidformer](https://github.com/ixlab/vidformer)
 - RSS feed: $source
 - date published: 2025-03-04T17:35:00+00:00

<p>Hi HN, this is a project I've been working on as part of my PhD.<p>Vidformer is a system that makes video annotation or transformation scripts practically instant. Traditional scripts that render full videos can take minutes—Vidformer speeds this up by optimizing execution and using on-demand rendering, so results appear immediately instead of waiting for entire videos to render. It works as a drop-in replacement for OpenCV's cv2, meaning most scripts can adopt it by simply changing "import cv2" to "import vidformer.cv2 as cv2"—no need to rewrite code or sacrifice flexibility. Vidformer is written in Rust and uses FFmpeg libraries for low-level video access.<p>Under the hood, Vidformer runs code with symbolic references to frames and tracks frame modifications to build a declarative representation of the task. Then, when rendering, it can transparently distribute the workload across many cores and efficiently use additional memory for caching frames. Further, it can expose a Video

## Launch HN: Enhanced Radar (YC W25) – A safety net for air traffic control

<p>Hey HN, we’re Eric and Kristian of Enhanced Radar. We’re working on making air travel safer by augmenting control services in our stressed airspace system.<p>Recent weeks have put aviation safety on everyone’s mind, but we’ve been thinking about this problem for years. Both of us are pilots — we have 2,500 hours of flight time between us. Eric flew professionally and holds a Gulfstream 280 type rating and both FAA and EASA certificates. Kristian flies recreationally, and before this worked on edge computer vision for satellites.<p>We know from our flying experience that air traffic management is imperfect (every pilot can tell stories of that one time…), so this felt like an obvious problem to work on.<p>Most accidents are the result of an overdetermined “accident chain” (<a href="https://code7700.com/accident_investigation.htm" rel="nofollow">https://code7700.com/accident_investigation.htm</a>). The popular analogy here is the swiss cheese model, where holes in every slice line u

<p>Hey HN, I made a Windows process monitor for app developers and advanced end users. I wanted a taskmgr system-level graph view per app. Windows procmon, while capable, has always been tedious to set up (esp. if not used often). That's pretty much the whole idea behind the app--to simplify app-level monitoring, to make it easy. I hope some of you find it useful!</p>
