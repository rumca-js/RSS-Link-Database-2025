This problem has definitely become more challenging overtime, and has forced me to write new AMSI bypasses. My goal with this post is to give a concrete example of selecting a set of bypasses and applying tailored obfuscation to evade AV and bypass defenses.</p> <p>Please let me know if you find this post helpful. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything I can do to improve!</p
