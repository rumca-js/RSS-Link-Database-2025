While sleep efficiency is also higher in modern settings, circadian rhythms are less regular. Researchers suggest reduced exposure to natural light may be a key factor in these disruptions. The study challenges the widespread belief that industrialised life leads to sleep deprivation, showing instead that sleep quantity is higher, though biological sleep cycles remain irregular.",
