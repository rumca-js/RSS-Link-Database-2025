<p>Graceful captain set the tone early on in thrashing of PSV and will need to be at his best when tougher tests arrive</p><p>If there was a moment that epitomised how Arsenal were going to approach what had appeared to be an extremely tricky <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/04/psv-eindhoven-arsenal-champions-league-match-report">away assignment against PSV Eindhoven</a> then it came in the 20th minute of this surprisingly one-sided first leg. Already leading through Jurriën Timber’s header, a cross from Leandro Trossard eluded everyone in the box but Martin Ødegaard had already set off in pursuit of the ball. His attempts to keep it in play eventually came to no avail despite a desperate slide, yet the Arsenal captain had set the tone.</p><p>Two minutes later, Ethan Nwaneri had etched his name into the history books again as the third-youngest goalscorer in the Champions League knockout stages, and Arsenal were well on their way to a statement win that will liv

## Díaz gives Real Madrid slim advantage after Álvarez stunner for Atlético

<p>This will be decided 14km east of here in eight days’ time. On a night that lacked a little thunder but had three fantastic goals, Rodrygo, Julián Alvarez and Brahim Díaz all stepping inside to bend the ball beyond outstretched fingers and into the far corner, the city’s fifth European derby delivered a victory for Real Madrid but no definitive conclusion. Atlético will host the second leg next Wednesday, and they will go into an occasion likely to be a lot more explosive than this with hope.</p><p>Diego Simeone may feel frustrated that long periods of control did not result in win, his team recovering from going behind in the fourth of what will be at least 180 minutes to draw level only for Díaz’s goal to beat them, but he agreed with Carlo Ancelotti’s prediction that this tie was never going to be settled on the first night. And if it could have been better, it might also have been worse: in the last minute, Marcos Llorente had to dive in as Kylian Mbappé escaped deep into the

<p>The Duchess of Sussex’s tone-deaf lifestyle show vibrates with vacuous joylessness – and is packed with useless information that will take a long, long time to remove from your head</p><p>It begins with bees. Because, yes, bees are aspirational signifiers of the good life. And yes, bees make beautiful honey for, say, stirring into a sun tea (that would be tea steeped in California sunshine for approx three to four hours) or drizzling into a “beautiful on the inside” cake (which, as far as I can make out, is a Victoria sponge.) But the Duchess of Sussex, who only started beekeeping a year ago but already has “good vibes for good hives”, also sees them as a reminder to do something that scares you a little bit. Like, say, making a tone-deaf lifestyle show in a $8m (£6.3m) Montecito farmhouse while the US and beyond goes to hell in a handcart. “I’m trying to stay in the calm of it because it’s beautiful to be this connected,” she whispers in a low tone, so as not to spook the bees.</

There were, as yet, no video or music streaming services, so music featured in a hit show could blow up as a result. One music supervisor – Alexandra Patsavas, whose work included selecting tunes for Grey’s Anatomy – became so influential that Lena Dunham’s Girls featured a storyline in which two characters dreamed of having their lives changed by getting a song approved by her on Grey’s Anatomy, most likely a wispy piece of indie electronica over which a doctor would gaze wistfully into the middle distance while another patient copped it.</p><p>While music supervisors may no longer have Patsavas’s power to create new stars throu

Are “life philosophies” even philosophy? I have to hold on to the idea that they aren’t, even in the face of a decade or so of Instagram blitzkrieg, most currently in the form of Duchess Meghan’s eight-part new TV show, which dropped on Netflix first thing this morning.

<p>Family planning in sports is no longer taboo, but elite female athletes like Kaillie Humphries and Maria Sharapova believe more open conversations should be taking place</p><p>The cold sterility of a gynecologist’s office is about as far removed as you can get from a tennis court, a basketball gym, or a bobsled run. The crinkling white paper, the flimsy open-face gown that leaves patients vulnerable and freezing, the intimidating silver instruments laid out neatly on a table – it’s hardly an environment that feels empowering.</p><p>Yet some of the highest highs and lowest lows of women’s lives take place in such rooms, just as they do on clay courts, snowy terrain or hardwood floors. It’s no small thing that women’s peak fertility coincides with their peak athletic performance. It’s a cruel twist of fate that just as professional female athletes must begin asking themselves whether they want to have children – and, if so, when and how – they are also focused on pushing their bodie

He is about to go back on the road in the UK with his 10th year of Ibiza Classics – described as an event for the relapse raver. Born in Kent, Pete was raised on classic British 60s fare, and he remembers with fondness tins of baked beans and sausages, and recalls with horror the foods he endured at boarding school. Grace and he discuss wining and dining Run-DMC when he was trying to get them to sign to his label, and what Noel Gallagher’s pet fish may or may not have eaten during the wild noughties running with the Primrose Hill set</p><p>New episodes of Comfort Eating with Grace Dent will be released every Tuesday</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/audio/2025/mar/04/s9-ep3-pete-tong-dj">Contin

Locals fear for their health – and despair that no one seems willing to help<br></p><p>One afternoon in July 2011, an 11-year-old boy named William Knowlden was out cycling with friends when he came upon Arnolds Field, an expanse of green land in Havering, east London. The site spans about 17 hectares, or 24 football pitches, and around its perimeter runs a wooden fence, with two access points through which vehicles can pass. Arnolds Field rises much higher than the surrounding land. Its surface is lumpy and undulating, like a blanket thrown over a heap of cuddly toys. The land is overgrown. It has been decades since animals grazed there, and few people have set foot on it in recent years. But every so often, it is mistaken for a safe place to explore.</p><p>As Knowlden descended a hill, he lost control and was thrown over the handlebars. When he came to, he was lyin
