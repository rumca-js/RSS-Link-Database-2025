<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a home server and don&#39;t really need a monthly subscription to Frugal anymore, which is the only one I have used. I see you can also buy a certain amount of bandwidth/volume/size of download... e.g. 1 TB for $20 or something like that.</p> <p>I was thinking of getting a few of these, and just setting up some priorities to use the &quot;cheapest&quot; one first. But I don&#39;t really know where to look. I see some black friday sales, but are there any good places to find new/current sales?</p> <p>First time posting here, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deten"> /u/deten </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j32ozi/i_recently_got_into_usenet_where_can_i_find_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1j32ozi/i_recently_got_into_usenet_where_can_i_find_good/">[comments]</a></span>
