<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Spotify pushed out the new changes to more countries, now including mine, making more modded APKs useless. While waiting for them to come back, the best alternative I found so far is ReFreezer. It lets you import your playlists from spotify, has no ads AFAIK, has most songs Spotify also has, and while some features might be missing, it&#39;s still the best alternative I found so far.</p> <p>edit: I&#39;ve noticed importing larger spotify playlists sometimes takes a few tries until it imports them fully, and for some reason the track count it shows doesn&#39;t seem to be accurate, but besides that it works.</p> <p>EDIT 2: there is a mod for esound music on happymod. it&#39;s quite unknown but it seems quite good and seems to work well so far. just has no native way of importing songs, gotta use a 3rd party service. feels almost better than spotify </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/david30121"> /u/d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! First of all I don&#39;t know anything about piracy other than how to do sims 4 DLC and ebooks for my kindle. But every single one of my books disappeared last Tuesday. I&#39;m genuinely devastated, I had so many annotations and highlights, also my ex who just dumped me gave me that kindle and downloaded most of those books for me so it&#39;s very painful lol.</p> <p>I wish I could get back the books along with my notes, but even if that isn&#39;t possible I still want to be able to add more to my kindle. The only problem is that they aren&#39;t showing up. I&#39;m doing the exact same thing I used to do, which is just downloading the EPUB files off z-library. Exact same page, same account, same link as I was using before, and they aren&#39;t showing up.</p> <p>People are saying to use calibre so I&#39;m going to try that next, but I&#39;m still confused as to what amazon could&#39;ve done to cause this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b
