I was pretty excited, especially after he showed me some initial results, like my site now showing up when I search its exact name (yay!).</p> <p>He worked for about two weeks, and after that, I started to dig a little deeper myself. I ran some audits on Google Search Console and Ahrefs&#39; free site audit, and... well, let&#39;s just say I found a bunch of issues. Stuff like indexing problems, categorization errors, you know, the usual SEO jargon that makes my head spin.</p> <p>I sent the reports to the SEO guy, and he basically said it&#39;s all &quot;normal&quot; and that it&#39;ll take around 4-6 weeks to fully fix everything. He said these kinds of issues are common after making initial changes.</p> <p>It&#39;s been two weeks since then, and honestly, I haven&#39;t noticed much difference. I&#39;m starting to get a bit anxious.
