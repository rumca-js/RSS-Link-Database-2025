<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, everyone! I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I can self-host things for myself to access quite reliably. I&#39;ve got a proxmox server that hosts multiple vms and services, such as Home Assistant, Pterodactyl. I own a domain and I&#39;ve used cloudflare to set up tunnels to my services so I can log into home assistant and proxmox remotely. </p> <p>But cloudflare tunnels don&#39;t allow certain traffic, such as streaming and gaming. I&#39;ve used a VPS with a reverse proxy to allow people to log into my Minecraft servers, but that was really tough to figure out. Took me 3 weeks of tinkering time. </p> <p>I&#39;m now looking into hosting a website, and some other services that are listed on the [awesome-selfhosted](<a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#polls-and-events">https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#polls-and-events</a>) list.

I don&#39;t want to access it from outside my network. This will just be for all of my devices within this network. The install process seems straight forward, but do I need to comment out some of the things the Docker image includes? Or can I just install this and since I have no ports opened up in my router, it will just work locally? I specifically don&#39;t know what Caddy does in all of thi. Is it just for remote certificates?</p> <p>I know this is a basic question, but the information I get from searching covers concepts that I don&#39;t understand as pretty much all of my network knowledge is strictly from a locally hosted standpoint.

Would that be a viable option, or would a dedicated NAS be a better long-term solution?</p> <p>Should I run all these apps on the Beelink and use the NAS just for storage, or would it be better to host some services directly on the NAS?

They do support OAuth, but I don&#39;t know enough to tie the two together. </p> <p>I&#39;m hoping that there is a bridge of sorts, an adapter, that can bridge between the authentication &quot;session&quot; that Authelia has for the authenticated user and the OAuth workflow for the specific app, so the app&#39;s OAuth &quot;workflow&quot; can &quot;notice&quot; the user is already authenticated and trust that.</p> <p>I don&#39;t even know the vocabulary I should be using, and whilst this isn&#39;t strictly self-hosted material, I suspect this is a pretty common use-case here.</p> <p>Any pointers?
