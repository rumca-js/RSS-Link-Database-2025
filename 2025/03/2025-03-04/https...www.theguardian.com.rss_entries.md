<p>Unai Emery knew what he was getting when he signed Marco Asensio: a three-time Champions League winner, for starters, but a high-pedigree star capable of bending games to his will. Just as Emery was getting hot under the collar on another awkward night at Club Brugge, the Villa manager booked for voicing his frustrations pitchside, a rare moment of quality snatched this game away from the hosts.</p><p>The mere presence of Asensio and Ollie Watkins seemed to spook Brandon Mechele into diverting Morgan Rogers’s superb cross into his own net and then Christos Tzolis clumsily chopped down Matty Cash and Asensio sent the subsequent penalty past Simon Mignolet. The cold reality is Villa toiled despite a dream start on their return to Belgium but it is hard to argue a two-goal advantage is not a sizeable buffer before next Wednesday’s second leg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/04/club-brugge-aston-villa-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bestselling Scottish painter loved by the public but dismissed by the art establishment and cultural critics</p><p>In the oil paintings that made Jack Vettriano famous and rich, the women are slim and wear evening dress, the men are chiselled and in tuxes, don homburg hats and long coats, and kiss the necks of their dates. In the world of Vettriano, who has died aged 73, couples dress up for the beach, drive classic cars, smoke late night cigarettes and drink whisky for carnal courage.</p><p>The artist defended his nostalgic vision against his many critics: “My paintings are about sex and that is not acceptable to them,” he said. “It would be OK if I painted inner-city problems and urban decay. They also don’t like me because I’m self-taught. I came in the back door and they haven’t had a chance to mould me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/mar/04/jack-vettriano-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A bread and butter pudding with a difference</p><p>I like this bread and butter pudding when it is barely set, so you get spoonfuls of just-set pudding and a little trickle of custard, for which I suggest a baking time of 35-40 minutes. If you prefer your pudding puffed up – more of a wobble than a quiver – then I suggest baking for 40-45 minutes.</p><p>Set the oven at 160C/gas mark 3. Break 2 large <strong>eggs</strong> into a bowl and beat until well mixed. Pour in 75ml of <strong>milk</strong> and 250ml of <strong>double cream</strong>. Add 50g of <strong>caster sugar</strong>, then beat everything lightly together with a whisk. Tear or slice 150g of <strong>panettone</strong> into large pieces and place in the baking dish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/04/nigel-slaters-recipe-for-panettone-pudding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Choose the speed that’s right for you, beware of price rises at renewal time and consider ditching your landline</p><p>In the age of true fibre broadband the speeds available can be tremendous – and providers often try to upsell people to expensive, higher-speed packages. One way to save money is to pay for only the speed you need. For most households a speed of 100Mbps is likely to be enough, although it depends on the number of people who will use the internet at the same time, the kinds of devices you use, whether you play online games and the services you require.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/mar/04/haggle-bundle-switch-best-uk-broadband-deal">Continue reading...</a>
