<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not really sure how to start this, but basically, I (20M, straight‚Ä¶ I think?) was at a party last weekend with my uni mates. We were all pretty drunk, and one of my friends (who‚Äôs gay) kissed me out of nowhere. Like, full-on snogged me.</p> <p>I was caught off guard, but the thing is‚Ä¶ I got hard. And now I don‚Äôt know what to think. I‚Äôve only ever been into women, never had any interest in guys before, never even questioned it. I just laughed it off at the time and didn‚Äôt mention it, but it‚Äôs been playing on my mind ever since.</p> <p>Does this mean I‚Äôm not straight? Or is it just a physical reaction? I‚Äôve heard people say things like ‚Äúa mouth is a mouth‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just trying to convince myself. Like, does getting turned on by something mean you must be into it? Or can it just happen?</p> <p>I feel like my brain is going in circles over this </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Signific
