<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of long-term storage to BluRay M-discs for capacity and longevity. These are things I don&#39;t want to go away for a long time, and cannot maintain the hard drives they live on. This is stuff like, family photos, video archive, etc.</p> <p>For those of you who have done Blu Ray archival, how do you do it? Personally, I was thinking of doing &quot;batches&quot; of .ZIP files, maybe about 5 - 10GB a piece, along with an MD5 hash (maybe the last four written on the disk itself) of those .ZIP archives written to disk. That way, when I transfer them, I can check the hash and know that all the data made it out.</p> <p>However... if the .ZIP archives become corrupted somehow, then bam, there it all goes.</p> <p>I like using .ZIPs because they&#39;re more portable and it&#39;s easier to move them than it is to move lots of tiny files all over the place. But when it comes to making sure that it&#39;s all -actually there- do
