<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/split-fiction-review-header1.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Split Fiction isn't your dad's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> - which is just as well, as that dad's currently a tiny wooden puppet being serenaded by a singing couple's counselling book. It might look and feel very similar to It Takes Two, particularly in the way its dual protagonists Zoe and Mio can leap, bound and grapple with playful exuberance through its bevy of winding and fast-paced action sequences. But it doesn't take long to realise this is an altogether different beast that's easily Hazelight Studio's most ambitious and inventive co-op adventure yet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Read more</a></p>

## Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 review: DLSS 4 doesn't deliver 4090 performance

RTX 4090 levels of performance from a $550 card is a heck of a promise, but what's arrived isn't anywhere near as exciting. Instead, we're looking at something akin to the RTX 4070 Super, a good card by all accounts at its $600 price point, but equipped with DLSS 4 and discounted to $550. That's a reasonable upgrade, but not one that'll grab the headlines. </p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">Read more</a></p>

Why would anyone mind them? They are loot on legs: twisted little demons who spew fountains of treasure if you catch them and kill them before they conjure a portal and run away. Downing one is like downing a boss, in terms of the loot that drops from them - it positively erupts - except you don't have to run through a dungeon to find them and they don't fight back. They're suddenly just there, in front of you, prompting a mad rush of greed as you drop everything to chase them down.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-time-to-admit-diablo-4-has-a-treasure-goblin-problem">Read more</a></p>
