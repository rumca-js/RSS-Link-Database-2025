<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious what’s your opinion on this, and if there is some common consensus already in the community. </p> <p>I already know many people, those who have been using VR longer than me, that would bet their money on various sim type games. I can get that, although I’m not personally that big a fan (again, guess it depends on what kind of simulator we’re talking about). From flying to racing sims, cooking sims … same as on flatscreen, every possible activity you can think of — there can be a VR counterpart which, at its best, is just irreplaceably more spontaneous as an experience than anything you just watch on screen. And hell, so many people are already hooked just on Eurotruck Simulator and Farming Simulator, this second being literally the only thing my nephew has been playing for months now…</p> <p>So yes, I’m beginning to think this might be, with some adjustments, where VR can really be able to show its capabilities.

My idea was to use to nintendo switch joy-cons at the ankles, one at the waist, the meta quest 3 headset and the two controllers as trackers, i also NEED the ability to switch from controllers to hand tracking for hand gestaures, i know that i can double tap the controllers togheador to enable hand tracking on the quest 3 but i want the program to still be able to track my hand movements (using the quest 3&#39;s hand tracking) to show them either in VrChat or on OBS Studio.</p> <p>Is there any program that can do that?</p> <p>I would love to find something like that and if needed i would not bother using an additional camera for even more tracking points.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have a rtx 3080 with an i9kf, I have a meta quest pro that I use to stream vie to al desktop and steam VR. When I am in VR the frames stay steady at 90 and randomly drops down to 72-75 and after a second or two goes back to 90 in the headset. I was looking at the in headset graphs of the gpu and cpu and doesn’t see any spikes. I also disconnected my monitor and streamed virtual desktop and still a fps drops down to 72-90. I’ve changed the graphic settings too. It’s like the pc sees it’s connected to the headset and tries to mirror the lowest refresh rate. Any help or advice greatly appreciated thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooGrapes5479"> /u/SnooGrapes5479 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j3dpaj/vr_fps_drops_any_help_appreciated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j3dpaj/vr_fps_drops_

I went over to my PC and hit tab and continued, and the game was completely controlled by keyboard. I tried looking through the games and steam settings, but I couldn’t find anything. </p> <p>Did I miss something or is the game supposed to be played only by keyboard? When I look it up via google- it says my quest 3 controllers should work just fine.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help, and sorry if I’m a super noob lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Glockometric"> /u/Glockometric </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j3c4jf/battlezone_gold_controller_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr

My PC specs are Ryzen 5, GTX 1650 and 16 gb of RAM, it was pretty enough when I used Windows Mixed Reality. Currently I&#39;m playing via Steam link wirelessly with definition set on around 1600x1600 and it gives some quality issues, but I&#39;m not sure is that caused by wireless latency or by not enough powerful PC which cannot sustain proper transcoding. So can wired connection make difference in my case? I know that is still takes part of computer resources for video transcoding so it will require better specs in comparison with DP/HDMI-connected headset.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FedorChib"> /u/FedorChib </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j38hqd/does_quest_link_via_cable_makes_difference/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j38hqd/d

I&#39;ve not decided on the headcet but it will be a pc based one. My question is how can I accomplish this. One solution is extension cables but because of the distance it would have to be done using fiber and as far as I can tell the converters are verry expensive. Can I place a cheap PC in the livingrop and use steam link or some other program (both computers connected with Ethernet). It claims to work for vr but when I search for it I only get a couple years old awnsers that says it doesn&#39;t work. Is there some cheaper fibre solution i haven&#39;t found? Or is there another way I haven&#39;t thought about.</p> <p>Edit: I suld have mentioned it but I will not get any headset that requires an account and as far as I can see all the wireless ones does :[</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Throwaway account, but last night I experienced something incredibly strange in VR Chat and a quick google didn&#39;t lead to any results of people experiencing anything similar.</p> <p>I was messing around with a friend in a mixed size world in VR when I started getting a sort of warm fuzzy feeling when he was large and petting my character&#39;s head, which I attributed to be some sort of phantom sense which other people have reported. However it then escalated after a short while to my entire body physically tensing and making me squirm whenever I was touched, though in a sort of oddly pleasant feeling way. It was quite an extreme effect to the point where I had to catch my breath whenever he pulled away.</p> <p>Has anyone ever experienced anything like this before or know what exactly this is? Is it just a sort of extreme phantom sense response or something else?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://ww
