<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Reddit&#39;s current moderation system relies on human moderators, and while many do a great job, it can leave a lot to be desired. I believe that AI moderation could improve the platform in several ways. AI processes posts and comments much faster than human moderators can, offering quicker responses to harmful content like harassment or spam. It can work 24/7, ensuring round-the-clock moderation, which is especially useful given Reddit’s global audience. As Reddit grows, AI could help scale up moderation across the site, and it can certainly adapt to the specific needs of each subreddit, given proper implementation. AI could also reduce bias in moderation decisions. While the good human moderators try to be fair, bias, whether conscious or not, will many times influence their choices. AI, on the other hand, can follow objective, data-driven rules, providing a more consistent and neutral approach to moderation, deferring to human moderators for revi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The emergence of artificial intelligence agents represents one of the most significant technological transformations of the modern era, marking a fundamental shift from passive computational tools to autonomous systems capable of perceiving, deciding, and acting in complex environments. AI agents—computational entities that sense their environment, process information, and execute actions to achieve specific goals, have evolved from simplistic rule-based systems to sophisticated autonomous entities capable of learning and adapting to novel situations<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00881">1</a>. This evolution has accelerated dramatically in recent years as advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning, have enabled unprecedented capabilities in agent perception, reasoning, and action selection<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb7e846c9a03af77c334f1b766a39f4cd9bc2b93">2</a>.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My school uses Turnitin AI detectors, and my work has been consistently getting false flagged. The first incident wasn’t too serious, as the flagged assignment was for an elective class, and I was able to work things out with the teacher. However, my most recent flagged assignment was for a core subject which I desperately need to get into university. My school gives out a 0, no questions asked when AI detection rates are over 50%. Although I am able to provide authentic edit history, I don’t think it will be enough to convince administration and my teacher that I’m innocent. What should I do? Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Overkill976"> /u/Overkill976 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j2xhog">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1j2xhog/someone_please_help/">[comments]</a></span>
