<p>Windows 11 has quietly added a new feature to your PC: AI-powered editing to the Windows 11 Notepad app, called Rewrite.</p>



<p>In November, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2513188/new-ai-experiences-make-their-way-into-windows-11s-paint-notepad.html">Microsoft began testing the addition of AI rewrite capabilities in Notepad</a>, and then developed it further as part of a February update. Now, Windows Latest has <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/03/04/windows-11-notepads-chatgpt-based-rewrite-rolls-out-to-everyone/">reported</a> that the AI-powered Notepad appears to have rolled out to everyone. It has certainly shown up on my PCs, whether they’re running the stable version of Windows or one of its test Insider editions.</p>



<p>In the upper right-hand corner of Notepad, you should see a little “magic pen” icon. That’s the new Rewri

<p>The latest firmware update for Microsoft’s Xbox controllers is causing considerable problems for gamers. In some cases, playing with an Xbox controller has become impossible.</p>



<p>The feature-packed update, which has version number 5.23.5.0 and was released on February 25th, was intended to improve the precision of the controllers, as Microsoft announced on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/25/xbox-february-update-invite-links-cloud-gaming-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Xbox website</a>. Unfortunately, the opposite appears to be the case.</p>

<p>Fans of the 1980’s-era sitcom <em>A Different World</em> were initially thrilled to hear that the <em>Cosby Show</em> spinoff was making the jump to Netflix, with all six seasons presented in HD quality. Then they started watching, and noticed there was, indeed, something very different about how <em>A Different World</em> looks on streaming.</p>



<p>Skin looks waxy. The text on signs looks strangely garbled. Faces in the background appear squished, sometimes even a tad monstrous. The image as a whole looks like an animated watercolor painting. Everything looks… well, <em>weird</em>, bordering on grotesque.</p>



<p>“Whether it’s Maggie, Jaleesa, Kimberly, or Ron, once familiar faces instead melted into unrecognizable visual goop,” <a href="https://movieweb.com/a-different-world-netflix-ai-controversy/">MovieWeb’s Salvatore Cento complained</a>.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has turned lots of heads with its Snapdragon X-powered laptops, which have amazing battery life and fewer issues than older Windows-on-Arm attempts. But buyers tend to balk at the compromises when the price gets too high. Not anymore!

<p>The Vivobook S15 is a little dull, but it’s rocking a vibrant 15.6-inch OLED screen, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 70-watt-hour battery that’ll outlast anything with an AMD or Intel chip. Our reviewer Matt Smith also liked the spacious touchpad and keyboard, which comes with a dedicated numbe

<p>We’re at T-minus eight months before Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2594758/windows-10-dies-in-2025-heres-the-impact-it-will-have-on-your-pc.html">officially gives Windows 10 the boot</a>. PC gamers in particular seem unready to let go of the operating system, which might start causing headaches if they intend to upgrade their hardware. For example, AMD’s new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2622531/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-target-4k-gaming-at-a-1440p-price.html">Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT graphics cards</a> will require UEFI instead of ye olde BIOS.</p>

<p>Power banks are the unsung heroes of our always-connected modern lives, and if you’re going to get one, you might as well purchase a model that can charge your phone, tablet, <em>and</em> laptop at once with ease.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Charger-20000mAh-Charging/dp/B0DK8V9LSV/">Baseus Blade laptop power bank</a> is perfect for that, especially now that it’s on sale. Normally priced at $100, it’s currently slashed down to just over $45 if you <strong>use code <code>7LHUWQOH</code> at checkout</strong>. That’s a hefty 54 percent discount on a power bank you’ll love.</p>



<p>For starters, the Baseus Blade has a large 20,000mAh capacity and a fast 100W charging output. That’s enough to recharge your phone about four times over or your laptop about once, and with the fast output you won’t have to wait around twiddling yo

<p>How fast is too fast for a monitor? If you ask Samsung, then 500 refreshes every second still isn’t too fast for PC gaming. That’s the speed of the latest OLED monitor panel the company is showing off in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress 2025. The 27-inch 1440p display is aimed right at the “sweet spot” for PC gamers. Meanwhile, Samsung is also showing off 240Hz OLEDs for laptops.</p>



<p><a href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31346">Samsung’s Display division</a> is demonstrating these new OLED panels independently of Samsung’s mobile hardware at the show, which is interesting since MWC is generally an event laser-focused on smartphones and other small devices. Among many other OLED panels, the most compelling offering for PC gamers is definitely “the world’s first 500Hz QD-OLED monitor.” That’s only <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2526801

<p>Comparing different versions of Microsoft Word documents is helpful for identifying changes between drafts. However, you don’t have to do it the old fashioned way. Word has a built-in feature called Track Changes, which will automatically highlight these changes for you. </p>



<p>In the Review ribbon of the Word document, you can select For All or Only Mine to highlight all edits to a text. If you haven’t activated this function, it’s still possible to compare at least two different versions of a document.</p>



<p>To do this, click on Compare in the Review ribbon and select the two files under Original Document and Revised Document. Under Mark Changes With, Word allows you to insert the name of the editor into the document.</p>

<p>Cloud storage is better, faster, and more affordable per gigabyte than ever before. But it’s not the best way to go for everything, nor can it completely replace local storage and backups. In fact, cloud storage can be drastically inferior to local storage, placing sensitive data in real danger of oversight, theft, and loss.</p>



<p>Storing your data locally on a physical drive that you can touch with your hands and manage on premises can be a great way to avoid the pitfalls of remote data storage. Here are several key ways in which local storage trumps cloud storage and remains relevant in 2025.</p>
