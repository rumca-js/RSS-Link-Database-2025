Beehives use thermoregulation to ensure the hive temperature stays between 33 and 36 degrees Celsius, about 91 to 97 degrees Fahrenheit. For example, bees might cluster to create insulation when it's cold or fan their wings when it's hot. But when beehives experience external stressors, such as pesticides or unexpected weather events, they lose the ability to regulate the hive temperature.",

In response, a white blood cell arrives at the scene. This cell encircles the pathogen with its membrane, forming a tight, constricting ring. With remarkable force, the white blood cell yanks the pathogen off the wound's surface. The white blood cell then engulfs the pathogen in a process called phagocytosis, in which it 'eats' the foreign invader to neutralize it.",

In order to address this challenge, researchers have developed Bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI), a novel two-dimensional electrocatalyst that effectively facilitates the hydrogen evolution reactions while minimizing the use of precious metals like platinum, paving the way for affordable hydrogen production.",

The procedure, called CALEC (cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells) involves taking stem cells from a healthy eye, expanding it into a graft over several weeks, then transplanting it into a patient's damaged eye. The groundbreaking procedure was developed to help people with injuries like chemical burns that lead to irreversible limbal stem cell deficiency, and the researchers hope the new findings warrant additional trials.",
