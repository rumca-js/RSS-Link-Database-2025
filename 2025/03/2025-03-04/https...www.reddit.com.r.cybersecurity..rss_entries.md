## In what kind of situations have your tools broken down?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some time ago I attended a talk by our national cybersecurity center. Few of their war stories were about cases where their tools broke down. Python scripts just could not handle the volume and had to be rewritten. When the country was a target of a Microsoft tech support scam campaign, both the technical system used to collect notifications from the citizens and the work processes/workflow for incident management broke down due to the high volume.</p> <p>Both stories are about the volume. Any other war stories of tools failing at a critical moment?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LeewardLeeway"> /u/LeewardLeeway </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j38yzs/in_what_kind_of_situations_have_your_tools_broken/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j38yzs/in_what_kind_of_situations_have_your_tools_broken/">[commen

## Why doesn’t Firefox encrypt the cookies file?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Until today, I was certain that Firefox encrypts the cookies file using the master password. I mean… it seemed pretty obvious to me that if you have a master password to secure your login credentials, you’d want to secure your cookie file even more, as it could pose an even greater security risk.</p> <p>That’s why I was so surprised to discover that Firefox (on macOS—but this isn’t OS-dependent, as it’s part of Firefox’s profile) doesn’t encrypt the cookies file at all. Everything is stored in plain text within an SQLite database.</p> <p>So basically, any application with access to application data can easily steal all your login sessions.</p> <p><strong>Am I overreacting, or should a 22-year-old browser really not have this problem?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/External_South_6218"> /u/External_South_6218 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1j38a

These things are not cheap. I personally feel they hardly serve a purpose anymore that is beyond traditional layer3/4 firewall&#39;ing and NAT&#39;ing. They are also a bitch to integrate in your devops strategies.</p> <p>I personally hate to use them to terminate TLS on, as certificate management usually sucks, partly due to lack of devops. Also SNI support is often not great, sending the right cert based on host name is usually ok, but then forwarding to the right backend is often not great. Authentication is also very cumbersome and in flexible. But if you don&#39;t terminate TLS on

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed a shift where ransomware attacks are now targeting VMware ESXi hypervisors rather than just endpoints. Campaigns like ESXiArgs and groups such as Cheerscrypt, Black Basta, and Defray777 have shown that hypervisor attacks can knock out entire virtual environments, bypassing the usual endpoint defenses.</p> <p>Most organizations still focus on EDR/XDR and firewalls, relying on built-in protections like Secure Boot and vSphere Hardening. But considering that ESXi servers host multiple critical VMs, and attackers can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities or stolen admin credentials, a single breach can compromise all hosted VMs. This makes me wonder if we’re neglecting runtime protection measures that could monitor and respond to threats as they occur.</p> <p>Is this gap due to a lack of awareness, or do companies assume that backup solutions are enough?
