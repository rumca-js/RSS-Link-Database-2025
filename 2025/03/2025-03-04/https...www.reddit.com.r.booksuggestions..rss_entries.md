<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (20f) am in college and still really close with my two middle school aged sisters, in part through this tradition we have where I facetime them a couple times a week to take turns reading chapters from a novel. Over the last 2 years we have read ALL of the Percy Jackson books and sequel series (Heroes of Olympus, Trials of Apollo, etc..) I don&#39;t want to stop the tradition, but I&#39;m not sure what to read now!</p> <p>My sisters are both very smart and have a very high reading level, so it&#39;s not so much about level of difficulty I&#39;m worried about, moreso, like, is it appropriate(ish)? Is it a fun read? We liked Percy Jackson because it did a good job balancing the comedy with the plot. It had good world-building, characters we were invested in, and actual stakes and yet it was laugh out loud funny and we were able to make jokes about it all the time and stuff. It was also nice that the fandom was still so alive because they were able to

As a gift, I wanted to read a book out loud and create my own audiobook for him to listen to while he’s at work. The only problem is that I’m not sure which one to read.</p> <p>He really likes the genres of fiction, mystery, thriller, suspense, survival. Likes a good plot twist and a bit of smut. He could possibly explore fantasy and a coming of age story.</p> <p>From the time I’ve been with him, the books so far that I know of he has read are: The Kind Worth Killing by Peter Swanson. He really liked this one but said the ending was “meh”. He read A Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides and liked it but wished we had more of the wife’s POV. Read the Notes on an Execution by Danya Kukafka but he rated it a 7 out of 10 and said he wouldn’t read it ever again. And then read Almond by Sohn won-pyung an
