(It&#39;s my favorite show and i love to watch it in the highest quality i can) This was when i was first getting into pirating and i just assumed the biggest the best. A couple months ago i found out about x265 encodes and how their size to quality ratio is better than x264. I started downloading x265 encodes as i noticed a lot of my movies were x264, and almost all the movies i redownloaded in x265 were around the same size but the quality was worlds better.</p> <p>Then i noticed The Walking Dead encode i had was x264, and i wanted to compare to a x265 encode because 1.6tb was a bit too much for me. I compared a couple episodes to loads of different x265 encoders on private trackers and public torrents and managed to find a x265 encode that was almost identical quality to the 1.6tb x264 encode i previously had.

While waiting for them to come back, the best alternative I found so far is ReFreezer. It lets you import your playlists from spotify, has no ads AFAIK, has most songs Spotify also has, and while some features might be missing, it&#39;s still the best alternative I found so far.</p> <p>edit: I&#39;ve noticed importing larger spotify playlists sometimes takes a few tries until it imports them fully, and for some reason the track count it shows doesn&#39;t seem to be accurate, but besides that it works.</p> <p>EDIT 2: there is a mod for esound music on happymod. it&#39;s quite unknown but it seems quite good and seems to work well so far. just has no native way of importing songs, gotta use a 3rd party service. feels almost better than spotify </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/david30121\"> /u/d",

The only problem is that they aren&#39;t showing up. I&#39;m doing the exact same thing I used to do, which is just downloading the EPUB files off z-library. Exact same page, same account, same link as I was using before, and they aren&#39;t showing up.</p> <p>People are saying to use calibre so I&#39;m going to try that next, but I&#39;m still confused as to what amazon could&#39;ve done to cause this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all. After writing a similar post last year that many seemed to find helpful, I\u2019ll share my mini-research for this year\u2019s F1 streams again. Here is a new list of <strong>free streaming options for all the F1 races</strong>. </p> <p>As always, a VPN will be necessary to access some of these services (certain countries block streams, so you must switch IP). I&#39;ve had success using NordVPN for this, but I\u2019ve noticed some stream providers have stepped up their VPN blocks, so let&#39;s see how this season rolls. </p> <p>Once you\u2019ve set up your VPN, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found for free F1 streams in 2025:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\"><em>Country</em></th> <th align=\"left\"><em>Broadcaster</em></th> <th align=\"left\"><em>Detail</em>s</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Austria</td> <td align=\"left\">ORF &amp; Servus TV</td> <td align=\"left\">All races for free</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Luxembourg</td> <td align=\"left\">RTL Zwee</",
