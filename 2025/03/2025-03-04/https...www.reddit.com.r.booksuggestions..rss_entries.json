        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello! Everytime I find a book on creativity, it is about how to unlock your creativity/get inspiration. I don&#39;t struggle with coming up with creative project ideas so much as actually honing in on fulfilling them and also with the mental block of being so afraid to fail that I feel paralyzed at the thought of working on them. Is there a book that deals with creative confidence and discipline, or maybe this isn&#39;t a problem with creativity but another psychological book altogether would help? Thank you for any suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hollandaiseyeah\"> /u/hollandaiseyeah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j3nbke/book_on_creative_confidencediscipline_and_not/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j3nbke/book_on_creative_confidencediscipline_and_not/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Books with \u201csex scenes\u201d are also fine.</p> <p>Examples of the theme I\u2019m going for are James Patterson\u2019s \u201cThe Murder House\u201d as well as Peter James\u2019 \u201cThey Thought I was Dead.\u201d I absolutely loved these books. I\u2019ve read Murder House at least 5 times, and it is by far my favourite book. They Thought I was Dead is also insanely good. It\u2019s one that makes you not wanna put it down.

When i was in middle school-to teen age, i enjoyed Percy Jackson and Magnus Chase. Im now playing the new God of War games and im very interested in Mythology again. I was curious if there was some newer fiction about mythology thats more aimed for adults. While i have fondness for Riordan books, i remember them being more directed to the age i was when i read them (12-16). Any recommendations? And if im misremembering the age recommendation for Riordan books, please catch me up on what from him i should read. Im tempted to just restart Magnus Chase since i dont remember them well. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Live-Cancel6404\"> /u/Live-Cancel6404 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j37lnx/looking_for_adult_rick_riordan_books_and_series/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",
