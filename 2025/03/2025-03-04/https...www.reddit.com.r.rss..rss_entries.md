<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everybody,</p> <p>Just thought I&#39;d share that after having used many RSS reader apps over the years, I decided to try out every single app that I could find on the App Store, and I couldn&#39;t believe when I found a relatively unknown app that ticked all the boxes and immediately became my absolute and undisputed favorite.</p> <p>It&#39;s called Cupfeed, and I got it for both Mac and iPhone/iPad.</p> <p>The Mac app is a one-time payment of $9.99 and the iOS app has both monthly, annual, and a lifetime subscription for $29.99</p> <p>I loved it so much--and I think that it deserves so much more recognition--that I did what I never do and came on Reddit just to promote it.</p> <p>Hope you like it as much as I do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FreedomPeaceJustice"> /u/FreedomPeaceJustice </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1j3fml5/tried_every_rss_reader_app_for_i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m planning on self hosting FreshRSS and I’d love to do a proper clean up of what I’ve been using till now. That you know, is there a reliable source where I can find good RSS feeds divided by categories (news, technology, education, etc…)? Thanks a lot in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sercosan"> /u/sercosan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1j3ffhf/is_there_a_list_off_good_rss_feeds_i_can_refer_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1j3ffhf/is_there_a_list_off_good_rss_feeds_i_can_refer_to/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>For a long time, I&#39;ve been looking for a news reader that helps me filter out the noise and read only the most interesting news. I&#39;ve not found one, so I created one myself.</p> <p>You can find the reader here <a href="https://feeds.fun">feeds.fun</a></p> <p>It is <a href="https://github.com/Tiendil/feeds.fun/stargazers">open sourced</a> and free to use.</p> <p>For me it saves over 80% of news-reading time, simply by filtering out most of the non-relevant news.</p> <p>How it works:</p> <ul> <li>For each news entry, the reader automatically assigns a lot of tags.</li> <li>You can create rules like <code>books + sci-fi -&gt; +5 score</code>, <code>politics + new-york -&gt; -10 score</code>.</li> <li>News are sorted by score, so you always see the most interesting news first.</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m looking for the first users and ready to answer your questions.</p> <p>Also, here are some links if you want to follow development
