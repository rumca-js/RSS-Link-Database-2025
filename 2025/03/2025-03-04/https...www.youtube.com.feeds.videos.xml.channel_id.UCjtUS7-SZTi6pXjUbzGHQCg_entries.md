With a tidal wave of waste potentially slamming landfills worldwide — is it true that these technologies are un-recyclable? Or that these green initiatives are maybe worse for the environment? Or could emerging recycling and upcycling technologies redirect this flood of waste into a new generation of photovoltaics, wind turbines, and battery banks designed to be continuously recycled and regenerated? Just how close are we to “closing the loop”?
