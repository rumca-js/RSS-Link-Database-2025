<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always felt her 2nd Oscar for Million Dollar Baby was her second chance but that blew itself up with some of the movies she got to make. She probably didn&#39;t have much to choose from. </p> <p>Aside from Insomnia and maybe PS I Love You (which did well at the box-office), none of the movies she made did well, commercially and critically. I think she stood a slight chance of getting a nomination for Amelia but that didn&#39;t pull through. </p> <p>The last I heard of her was in that Christian film she did with Alan Ritchson and there was that. </p> <p>I&#39;ve always liked Hillary Swank. I was rooting for her when she got the Oscar for Boys Don&#39;t Cry, a major FU for 90210 after they fired her. </p> <p>It&#39;s unfortunate Hollywood didn&#39;t know how to use her properly. I did like a film she did, which was virtually ignored, called Conviction. I wish that film had received more attention.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

I remembered the brutal parts of the movie, but I didn&#39;t remember how casually it all starts. The family is living their lives trying to go on like everything is okay. Szpilman keeps playing the piano as bombs fall outside of the studio. He is flirting with the girl who came to see him. There&#39;s the normal sibling banter going on. Then the food starts get scarcer. The neighbors get killed. The ghetto is a rumor that becomes true. Everything starts so small, but then his entire family gets put on the train. It&#39;s so sad and so scary to see the world change so quickly- to see people lose everything.</p> <p>Edit: I intentionally did not bring up America because I did not want a bunch of MAGAts spewing their hate.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was recently thinking why do Stephen King&#39;s books usually make great films, and concluded it probably helps that the books themselves are great (along with having the right director, screen writer etc.). Then I was wondering, are there any films that were great (popular, critically acclaimed etc.) but based on books that were considered bad? I know things are subjective and what some consider bad isn&#39;t the case for everyone, but are there books that were considered UNIVERSALLY crap that somehow made a good film?</p> <p>This isn&#39;t exactly one of those posts about films that are better than the books they were based on, but taking it further that the books themselves were terrible to begin with. E.g. Fight Club is usually the &quot;go-to &quot; for a film that was better than the book, but Fight Club the book was still a success. I&#39;m looking for &quot;how the hell did someone turn this crappy book into this amazing film?&quot;.</p> <p
