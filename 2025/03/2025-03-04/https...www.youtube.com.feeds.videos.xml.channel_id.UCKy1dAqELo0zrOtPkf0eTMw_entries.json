The cast also shares insights on the importance of doing the narrative justice and the camaraderie they developed while authentically recreating this mission.\n\nWritten and directed by Iraq War veteran Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (known for Civil War and 28 Days Later), WARFARE immerses audiences with a platoon of American Navy SEALs as they monitor the movements of U.S. forces through insurgent territory, all from the home of an Iraqi family. This visceral and real-time portrayal of modern warfare is based on the experiences and memories of those who lived through it, offering a unique perspective never seen before.\n\n#IGN #Movies",

In this gameplay comparison, we'll take a look at Grand Theft Auto 5's Prologue, in North Yankton, the first mission featuring Franklin and Lamar, and a particular cutscene featuring a \"old yee-yee ass haircut\".\n\nHow has GTA 5 changed from the PlayStation 3 (via the RetroTINK-4K), to a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 PC build running at the Maximum RT graphics preset?\n\nDoes the addition of ray tracing, ambient occlusion, global illumination, ray traced shadows, reflections, and more, really make the difference?

Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\n\"An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they\u2019re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it\u2019s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss.\"",
