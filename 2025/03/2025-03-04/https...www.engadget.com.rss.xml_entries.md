Scam Detection will notify you if it detects suspicious writing patterns from the messages you&#39;re receiving and will give you the option to report and/or block the conversation. For the privacy-minded, Scam Detection runs locally on your device, keeping your messages safe from prying eyes.</p>

The company says this is the first-ever microphone of its type to offer this feature. For the uninitiated, polar patterns dictate where a microphone picks up sound. Most of the mics in this category offer just an omnidirectional polar pattern, which records equally from all sides. Some companies swap that out for a cardioid pattern, which picks up audio from a single direction.</p> 
<p>The MoveMic 88+ offers access to both of the aforementioned polar patterns, in addition to bi-directional and raw mid-side. Why does any of this matter? It increases the versatility of the microphone. The cardioid pattern is perfect for, say, a TikTok video or an acoustic performance. The bi-directional pattern would be the go-to choice for a two-person interview and the omnidirect

## The new base iPad comes with twice the storage but no Apple Intelligence

<p>Apple has been steadily updating its product lineup over the last year or so to make sure as many devices <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-announces-the-iphone-16e-with-apple-intelligence-for-599-161435140.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-announces-the-iphone-16e-with-apple-intelligence-for-599-161435140.html">work with Apple Intelligence</a> as possible. But shockingly enough, the new base iPad now has an A16 chip rather than the A14 in the previous model. That'll certainly provide better performance, but it's not enough for Apple Intelligence.

It’s continuing that tradition by announcing its first-ever roller luggage, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/roller-pro-carry-on-luggage-by-peak-design"><ins>the Roller Pro Carry-On</ins></a>. This bag is appropriate to stow away overhead during flights, thus the name, but also comes with some tech-friendly features.</p>
<p>First of all, there’s a hidden compartment specifically for an AirTag tracker. That would come in mighty handy in the case of a mistaken identity/swapped luggage type of deal like in the movies. It also boasts external gear loops for hooking stuff like tripods. There’s a protected pocket for chargers, headphones, tablets and laptops.</p>

## NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 review: Basically a 4070 Ti that’s better at 4K

<p>I'll cut right to the chase: If you're an <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-4070-review-the-new-1440p-gaming-leader-130010874.html"><ins>RTX 4070</ins></a> owner looking to upgrade to NVIDIA's latest video cards, the $549 RTX 5070 won't be much different than what you're used to. Aside from DLSS 4's ability to generate multiple extra frames, the 5070 is practically the same as the 4070 Ti in our testing (and in some cases it's worse). So if you're already committed to spending more than $500 for a new GPU, you're likely better off saving up a bit more for the $749 5070 Ti, which has more VRAM (16GB instead of the 5070's 12GB) and more capable hardware for gaming in 4K.</p>
<p>Given the current state of the video card market, though, those prices are basically just theoretical. NVIDIA's previous RTX 50-series cards are already selling well above their retail prices at most stores, if you can find them in stock at all. So I wouldn't be surprised t

Now, the company has launched an updated version that boosts the refresh rate to 240Hz — making it a tempting option for gamers who prize visuals and speed. Dell&#39;s gaming brand also revealed several inexpensive LCD gaming models, including a 25-inch, 320Hz model for just $250.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of the boosted refresh rate, the new Alienware 34 Ultra-Wide QD-OLED Monitor (AW3425DW) offers improved connectivity with HDMI 2.1 FRL, while adding G-SYNC, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and VESA AdaptiveSync certification. As before, it comes with WQHD 3,440 x 1,440 resolution and 1800R curve, providing a 21:9 gaming experience that while not as sharp as 4K, is still a

<p>Nothing doesn’t have a Phone 3 yet, instead choosing to make a lateral move to not one, but two new mid-range devices, the Nothing Phone 3a and, intriguingly, the 3a Pro. Reassuringly, Nothing continues to design phones unlike anything else out there. Its retro-future design aesthetic for the exposed-but-not hardware on the rear of the phones, as well as the dot-matrix fonts, animations and software, are all back.</p> 
<p>Hardware design remains Nothing’s biggest strength. I get asked about the Nothing phone more than I do when I’m using the latest iPhone, Samsung’s foldables or anything else. It’s just <em>different</em>. The Phone 3a series now has a glass backing (upgraded from polycarbonate) and you can still see screw fittings, electronics and a return of Nothing’s Glyph lighting system. The Phone 3a is rated IP64, adding better protection this year against rogue water sprays and liquid incidents.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
