I decided to update it to v4.04 linked on the post, but now the game won&#39;t run, even though the process is still running in Task Manager. No error code, just won&#39;t open. When I run the bat file to update it to 4.04, I get the message &quot;This app can&#39;t run on your PC&quot;, but then it extracts the &#39;remaining 163 updates files&#39;. I&#39;ve run it as an admin but that makes no difference. (I&#39;m on Windows 11) I&#39;ll have to reinstall the game, but how do I avoid this when I&#39;m updating it after that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ctlattube\"> /u/ctlattube </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1j5p1ri/witcher_3_wont_launch_after_update/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1j5p1ri/witcher_3_wont_launch_after_update/\">",
