        "description": "Archaeologists in El Salvador have unearthed 2,400-year-old ceramic puppets with expressive faces atop a pyramid. The figurines, featuring movable heads, were likely used in public rituals to depict historical or mythical events. The discovery challenges the belief that ancient El Salvador was culturally isolated, linking its traditions to broader Central American networks. Similar artifacts found in Guatemala further support the theory of shared traditions among regional elites. Other items at the site, including jade pendants, indicate extensive cultural and trade connections.",

However, a recent study proposes an alternative explanation, suggesting the plumes may originate from a semi-liquid layer within the moon\u2019s ice shell. Researchers believe shear heating along fractures creates slushy, salt-laden reservoirs near the surface, challenging previous assumptions. This new perspective raises fresh questions about the habitability of Enceladus and the mechanisms driving its geysers. Further investigation is needed to confirm these findings.",
