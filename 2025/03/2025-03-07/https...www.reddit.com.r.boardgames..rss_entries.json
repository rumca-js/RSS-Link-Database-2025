One of my friends played as the traitor, the Banshee, and another friend had the Crossbow item. In the traitor\u2019s book, it says that we cannot attack the Banshee using Might, and the Crossbow says we can use Speed instead of Might.</p> <p>For me, that means we cannot use the Crossbow against the Banshee, since we are not allowed to attack it with Might in the first place. However, my friend insists that we can. A Banshee is a spirit, so in a &#39;realistic&#39; way, an arrow would just pass through it. Logically, if we cannot use Might, then we shouldn\u2019t be able to substitute Speed for it, since the restriction is on attacking with Might itself.</p> <p>Am I wrong, or is my friend wrong?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comfortable_Plate_14\"> /u/Comfortable_Plate_14 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen",
