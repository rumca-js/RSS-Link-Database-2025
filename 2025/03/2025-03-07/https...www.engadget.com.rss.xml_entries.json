In tablet mode, they\u2019re handy for jotting down notes and drawing pictures, and in their full laptop configurations, they can let you manage e-mail and write as you would with a traditional notebook. Whether you\u2019re a student, creative or just want a more flexible setup, a 2-in-1 solution gives you the best of both worlds without having to carry multiple devices.<br><br>We've tested and reviewed some of the top 2-in-1 options out there from brands like HP, Microsoft, Samsung and Apple. Whether you\u2019re looking for a Windows PC that can occasionally act like a tablet, or traditional slates that can be empowered with keyboard accessories, we\u2019ve rounded up the best models to consider.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-factors-to-consider-before-buying-a-2-in-1-laptop\">Factors to consider before buyin",
