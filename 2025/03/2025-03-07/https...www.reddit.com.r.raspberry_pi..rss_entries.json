The screen I have has two pads in the middle of the board, one labeled PWM and the other labeled ground. I cant find any reference too these in any docs anywhere but I assume that they are for brightness control?</p> <p>Does anyone have any information on this?

I haven\u2019t gotten mine to work yet it drops SSH as soon as Ethernet is communicating. I have a Raspberry Pi 5 I can use if it can do that.
