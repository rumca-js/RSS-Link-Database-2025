When I sat down to play developer MercurySteam\u2019s latest project, Blades of Fire, I expected something of a return to the studio\u2019s Castlevania: Lords of Shadow games, updated with the modern stylings of God of War. An hour later I thought I was playing a Soulslike, albeit one where all the stats were in my weapons rather than an RPG character sheet. By the end of the three-hour hands-on session, I realised both of those observations were simultaneously true and false: this is a game that is unmistakably built on well-worn ground, but the unique arrangement of both its borrowed components and new ideas results in a fresh and interesting approach to the action-adventure genre. Don't miss our impressions and a look at some Blades of Fire gameplay!\n\n#Gaming #BladesOfFire #Games",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe popular communications service Discord could become a publicly traded company in the future. The service has proven a hit with gamers and content creators, who use it for voice chat and group messaging, and so far it's been relatively devoid of third-party ads. But gamers are now worried that Discord going IPO could bring with it a deluge of ads. In other news, beta testers in the Xbox Insider program are urged caution when trying out the latest Xbox update. Users are reporting their profiles being removed from their consoles after the update. And finally, Sony has dropped some new gear: a Last of Us-branded DualSense controller with icons commemorating Ellie and Abby's dual journey in the acclaimed game saga.\n\n#IGN",
