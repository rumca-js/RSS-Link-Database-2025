But if you are looking for a cycling holiday away from the crowds you\u2019re better off heading 40 miles north to the Kop van Noord-Holland. Here you will find the largest contiguous bulb area in the country. April is the best time to cycle among the millions of colourful crocuses, daffodils, hyacinths and tulips. Between Schagen, Den Helder, Den Oever and Middenmeer you will find flower fields as far as the eye can see. I\u2019d highly recommend the dune road from Callantsoog to Den Helder.
