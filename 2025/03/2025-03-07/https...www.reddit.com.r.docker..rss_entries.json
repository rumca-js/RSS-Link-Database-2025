Everything is good, containers are up.<br/> However I&#39;m unable to access the web ui of OpenXPKI. The docker is installed on Ubuntu 24.02 CLI Server and I&#39;m accessing it via ssh. I&#39;ve checked the documentation and other articles, they direct me to access the web ui with ip of docker container. I cannot do it as the host is a VM deployed on Hyper-V.<br/> I want the web ui to be accessed via host&#39;s ip. </p> <p>Any help would be much appreciated.<br/> Note: I&#39;m a starter in micro-services world. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vrk5398\"> /u/vrk5398 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1j60q1t/need_help_with_docker_container_networking/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1j60q1t/need_help_with_docker_",
