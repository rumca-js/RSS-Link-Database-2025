Widgets have been available on the lock screen of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23765921/google-pixel-tablet-review\">Pixel Tablet</a> since last year, but Google is now bringing them to phones and more tablets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All widgets will support the lock screen by default, though app developers will have the option to disable support if they prefer. Certain widget actions \u2014 such as triggering an app \u2014 will still require you to authenticate with a fingerprint, pin, or face unlock before they\u2019ll function.</p>\n\n<p cla",
