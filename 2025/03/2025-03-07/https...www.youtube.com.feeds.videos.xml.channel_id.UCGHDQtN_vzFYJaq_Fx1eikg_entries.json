        "description": "If your name was Bum Farto, would you try to keep a low profile or would you make sure history would remember the name Bum Farto?\n\n\n\"Joseph \"Bum\" Farto (July 3, 1919 \u2013 January 1, 1986) was a fire chief and convicted drug dealer in Key West, Florida, who disappeared in 1976. He was one of several politically connected Key West individuals arrested as part of a sting operation known as Operation Conch. Farto disappeared shortly after his conviction and was declared dead in absentia in 1986. His life and disappearance has been the subject of a 2020 podcast series and a 2021 Pamela Stephenson play.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bum_Farto\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/qxir\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/QxirYT\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100091768766293\nI",
