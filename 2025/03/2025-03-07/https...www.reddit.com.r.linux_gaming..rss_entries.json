In-game menus are borderline unusable because the mouse cursor constantly stutters. This isn&#39;t limited to the game; if I alt-tab to another window, the mouse is still difficult to use. Minimizing the game helps somewhat, with the cursor alternating between working normally and stuttering. </p> <p>My computer has an AMD Threadripper CPU and RTX 2070 graphics card, running DraugerOS (based on Ubuntu). I&#39;ve tried launching with multiple versions of Proton, including ProtonGE9-25, but that hasn&#39;t had a major impact. The games I&#39;ve tried have all been rated as functional on ProtonDB. </p> <p>I&#39;m fairly new to Linux, and I have no idea what might be wrong.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aSarcasticFringeHead\"> /u/aSarcasticFringeHead </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:",
