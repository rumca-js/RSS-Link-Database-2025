        "description": "SID Display Week 2025 is coming to San Jose, CA, May 11\u201316. Last year's event was a whirlwind of groundbreaking innovations. While I managed to share insights on Jade Bird Display's MicroLED\u00a0Compensation, I\u2019ve been sitting on information and photos on many other companies from Display Week 2024. With this year's show right around the corner, it's time to dust off those notes and many photos and write about the display and optics technology I found at last year\u2019s Display Week, which was so interesting that I want to go back again this year.",
