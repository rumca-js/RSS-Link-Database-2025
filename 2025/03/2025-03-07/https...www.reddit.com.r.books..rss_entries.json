If you have read the book, you know that Okonkwo is a stubborn and proud man who values honor and to be regarded \u201das a man\u201d. Yet in the end he hangs himself thus disgracing himself and his family. This was a big surprise to me, as I always assumed that he would rather choose to die honorably in battle than by giving up, as such. </p> <p>I am pondering the reason for this. Did he take his life because he knew that he would be imprisoned and therefore could never achieve his dream of becoming the clan leader? My gut tells me he would not act in this way. Could the author have felt it necessary for Okonkwo to commit suicide as a means to portray some kind of deeper meaning? The only one I can think of is as a metaphor for the \u201ddeath\u201d of the indigenous culture, but for that to be the case he could just as well have died fighting for his life, which again, would more befit his character.</p> <p>W",

The plot feels too weak to fully engage an adult audience, yet the mature content makes it unsuitable for younger readers. It had so much potential in the first half, and I truly enjoyed the opening chapters. Now, with just 30 pages left, I\u2019m struggling to finish. Definitely not a cozy read for me. </p> <p>Sigh!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste_Project_7864\"> /u/Waste_Project_7864 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j5kq3t/the_very_secret_society_of_irregular_witches/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j5kq3t/the_very_secret_society_of_irregular_witches/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I wondered what the big deal is, this seemed to me a simple , grandiose guilded age story. Then I saw the movie ( Di Caprio one) and the movie really added new angles to my perspective and helped me see the hidden depth in the book. I read the book again and simply loved it this time... for the first time ever, a movie has helped me understand literature better. Of course, the cast and director have done an excellent job. But I am still surprised how I missed the nuances and poetry hidden within The Great Gatsby and how the movie revealed them to me... </p> <p>Have any of you ever had such an experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KayLone2022\"> /u/KayLone2022 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1j5jvfc/the_great_gatsby/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.redd",

How I went through my life until 30 years old without ever hearing of this book before this subreddit is, frankly, astounding considering how much I&#39;ve been a reader my whole life, but here I am. </p> <p>Calling it a Greek epic but about rabbits is the best short description I&#39;ve ever seen for it. I saw the &quot;how do I describe watership down to people&quot; post and decided to listen to the Peter Capaldi audiobook...wow. Probably the best way to experience it the first time imo, Capaldi PERFORMS. (Plus, it really helped with understanding the Lapine language to have him reading the words instead of my brain just mushing the sounds together) I was completely transported listening. I cheated a bit and looked up if any of the main characters died after Bigwig&#39;s first near death experience, so I wasn&#39;t losing my mind the rest of the book when bad things cropped up...but the ending??
