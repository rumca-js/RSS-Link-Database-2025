There\u2019s a specific scene I remember:</p> <p>Two kids on bikes find a hole with a skull inside. One of them goes down to investigate and touches the skull. As soon as he does, he freezes in place and suddenly black leeches, slugs, or larvae start coming out of his eyes and body, devouring him alive. Later in the movie, a worker investigating the hole suffers the same fate.</p> <p>I watched it as a kid and maybe some details are different :(</p> <p>Does anyone know what movie this is?

DeNiro and a young DiCaprio on the same film antagonizing each other in phenomenal performances in a incredible story. </p> <p>The movie is the real story of writer Tobias Wolff during his teenage years when his mother was married to his abusive stepfather. Based on the synopsis I thought that would be a great moment of revelation when we find Dwight (played by DeNiro) is abusive but it starts simple, we see a positive side of the character consistently while we still realize how awful he is. It&#39;s also the most realistic portrayal I&#39;ve seem of bullying from an authority figure. When I finished the movie, I knew there would still be some people who think Dwight was a good guy who was just parenting simply because the movie doesn&#39;t exaggerate his abuse.</p> <p>I&#39;m amazed by the fact I never heard of this film considering the big names attached to it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

Granted, I am 23 years old now, I vaguely remember seeing the black hole and ending scene of the movie back in the mid 2010s when I was a young teen, and had no fucking idea what I was watching. The movie is quite bizarre without plot context LOL.</p> <p>After watching the film, I really enjoy how the plot wraps up. It&#39;s like every little detail from start to finish all comes full circle in the end. Honestly, I found myself understanding the story better than I did with Tennet which I needed to watch like three times alongside a couple explanation videos. Christopher Nolan has a very unique way of implementing time travel into his movies and making it actually work and make sense. Obviously, I&#39;m no scientist so I can&#39;t tell you the super detailed concepts of the movie, however, I did understand the story and I loved it.</p> <p>Nolan has way of takin",

Plus the B&amp;W and outdated filmmaking over and over isn\u2019t necessarily ideal for a marathon, not for me at least.

It is portrayed in the movie that a unit kills themselves with grenades (after disobeying a direct order) by pulling the pin, hitting their head with the grenade, yelling bonzai and having it explode on their chest.</p> <p>I know officers would stab themselves, but would soldiers commit suicide in this manner? Was it common? I tried looking online for this but I could not find anything.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l2NeCiP8b8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l2NeCiP8b8</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CanadianClassicss\"> /u/CanadianClassicss </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j5atjc/letters_from_iwo_jima_did_japanese_soldiers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j5atjc/letters_from_iwo_jima_did_japanese",
