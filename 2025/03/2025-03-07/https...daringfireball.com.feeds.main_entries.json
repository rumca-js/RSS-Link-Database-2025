It\u2019s going to take us longer than we thought to\ndeliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in\nthe coming year.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <em>really</em> don\u2019t mean to be overly pedantic (so I\u2019ve edited this post since original publication), but Apple\u2019s statement reads \u201cin the coming year\u201d, so I think it\u2019s possible we could see those features in iOS 19.0, 19.1, or 19.2 before the end of 2025. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple did not give a reason for the delays. The iPhone maker had previously indicated the features would come in 2025.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, hairspli",
