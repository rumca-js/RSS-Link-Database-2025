Upon my initial search (since I\u2019m unfamiliar with these books) I found some mixed reviews. </p> <p>What\u2019s important to me, is strong female characters. I don\u2019t necessarily mean literally strong, warrior types. It\u2019s more that I want these women to be complex, well-developed and intentional in the context of the story outside of a male character\u2019s love interest. An example from a book I recently read is Fidele in The Faithful and the Fallen series by John Gwynne, she\u2019s a very compelling character without being a strong warrior. I do love a female warrior though haha.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen reviews mentioning this as a big issue for them so I wanted to ask people here! Please let me know if these are exaggerated or on point, and just your overall thoughts on the series. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",

And lastly the writing style caught me, it was descriptive in a poetic(?) way, really easy to visualize every scene through the eyes of the main character. There was also romance which I liked but I don\u2019t mind suggestions with none of it.</p> <p>So to sum it up, I\u2019m looking for character driven stories that are dark and emotional (but not hopeless) with good writing and optional romance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

I&#39;d just finished two emotionally draining stories* and was having a pretty manky time at work, so took a recommendation from my partner to read <em>Fourth Wing</em>, the tale of Violet Sorrengail attempting to join the elite Dragon Riders at a sort of dragon university, where she may or may not fall in love with other members of her corps.</p> <p>It is very easy to read, with dramatic escapades almost every chapter. Violet is smaller and weaker than other members of her class and has some form of disability that affects her joints, causing them to be easily injured. However, at no point in the book does she use this as an excuse to fail or bail out of her tasks - she constantly adapts to find ways round it.
