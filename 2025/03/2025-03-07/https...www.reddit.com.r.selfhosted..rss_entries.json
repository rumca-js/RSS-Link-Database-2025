It downloads images missing from the webcomic in a nice neat foulder. </p> <p>But I cant figure out a simple and intuative way to read those webcomics. Currently I&#39;m just using file browser, but that sucks for any kind of binge reading, or even just keeping up with current webcomics. It would be nice if there was something like kavita / komga for webcomics, let me pick up where I left off or just skip to most recent comic. </p> <p>I have tried kavita and komga but neither are able to handle foulders with thousands of individual images in them, which is what I have. komga just does not support that use case, and kavita is similarly to opinionated for my use case, although less so then komga. it ",

I am pretty new to this thing and I want to be able to make sure i have my server&#39;s boot drive always running, I am planning on doing this by performing a Raid 1 on my boot drive but I don&#39;t know how to. I managed to set up a raid 1 on 2 of my HDD&#39;s that had some files for my HTPC using Cockpit and following some tutorials I saw on youtube. Now I&#39;ve bought another m.2 to setup the raid 1 on my boot drive but my current bootdrive is not showing up in cockpit. Is it even possible/feasible to do this? Should I just do an image backup of my boot drive every now and then instead and save it somewhere else?</p> <p>P.S. I also should add that my boot drive doesn&#39;t only have the OS, some apps that I installed via casaos are being kept in the bootdrive, I am just afraid of my m.2 failing someday and having to setup basically everything again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lewo",
