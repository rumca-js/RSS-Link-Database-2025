        "description": "<p>Atomfall is a detective game. Yes, the post-apolyctic first-person shooter from the Sniper Elite studio feels more like Paradise Killer than Fallout. Rather than ping-ponging between objective markers around a map, Atomfall's story is structured around a series of clues that are organically picked up and tracked as you explore its world. Its quests are nonlinear and you're gently guided to points of interest. From there, it's on you to reference your quest log and put the story of its world together.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Atomfall's world might look derivative given how prevalent the post-apocalyptic genre is, but its setting and tone do a lot to differentiate it from its peers. The game takes place five years after the Windscale fire of 1957, a real-world event that happened in the UK and is considered one of the worst nuclear accidents in history. However, Atomfall envisions a world that never properly recovered from that disastrous event. Violent factions have popped up all over Engl",

On March 11, the 2025 Guardian Games will begin with a few changes. Guardian Games Nightfalls and Focused Activities have been dropped from this year's event. In their place is a new boss rush mode called Rushdown, which looks like it will test even the most seasoned Destiny 2 players.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_03_06_2025\">the details for this year's Guardian Games</a>, including the way that Rushdown will work.
