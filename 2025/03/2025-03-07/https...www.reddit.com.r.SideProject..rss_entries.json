For example, say you&#39;re learning Web Development, and you reach the JavaScript lesson. You can then create a whole separate JavaScript course within that lesson to explore it even more.

We kinda just made whatever we thought would sell, but I&#39;d like some advice on how else to grow this shop, because I honestly don&#39;t really know anything about business. Stuff like how to decide on what products to sell, where would be nice to promote the business, how to determine the prices, and how to market it online... Thank you.</p> <p>This is a link to the shop, if anybody wants to check it out or provide comments for improvement:<br/> <a href=\"https://www.raket.ph/tojongkarylle2305\">https://www.raket.ph/tojongkarylle2305</a></p> <p>Our recent products, if anybody wants to check it out! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05:<br/> <a href=\"https://www.raket.ph/tojongkarylle2305/products/mind-map-aesthetic\">https://www.raket.ph/tojongkarylle2305/products/mind-map-aesthetic</a><br/> <a href=\"https://www.raket.ph/tojongkarylle2305/products/baby-showerbirthda",

It all started when LLMs started being able to process images. I had this idea to build a grocery scanner that would use AI to analyze confusing product labels and help people make healthier choices at the store.</p> <p>I spent about 6 months building the MVP for that initial concept. Honestly, the launch didn&#39;t go as well as I&#39;d hoped. I struggled with marketing, and the feedback I did get pointed out some major areas for improvement. It was tough, but those critiques were invaluable.</p> <p>Instead of giving up, I decided to pivot. I realized there was a bigger opportunity to help people with their overall diet, not just individual grocery purchases. So, over the last 4 months, I&#39;ve been transforming that initial idea into a full-fledged diet tracking app. I spent a lot of time looking at existing diet apps, identifying their weaknesses",

Coding \u2013 Can you solve problems faster than AI? 2. Image Editing \u2013 Is your creativity better than machine-generated designs? 3. Writing &amp; Content Creation \u2013 Can your words outshine AI-generated text?</p> <p>The platform would rank human skills vs AI, track improvements, and show where AI still struggles. But before building it, I need your feedback.</p> <p>Would You Use This? 1. Do you think humans can still outperform AI in certain areas? 2. What skill would you want to compete in? 3.
