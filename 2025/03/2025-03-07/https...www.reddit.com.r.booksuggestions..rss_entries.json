The only other piece of fiction I\u2019ve encountered that nails the same setting and vibe is the roleplaying podcast The Adventure Zone, in their Amnesty campaign.

I tried to get a sense of what her taste is, and what I gathered is that what she gravitates toward is not non fiction!

She likes stories about people, with things that can happen to anyone, and a touch of magic realism also works. anything that can reflect or parallel our ordinary lives; things that can move us. </p> <p>What do you guys suggest?

Not big on long series, so I&#39;d prefer either standalones or maybe a 2-4 book series. Seven and the Batman movie from 2022 are both good examples of what I&#39;m looking for.

We did this for about an hour and the last book we landed on we had to check out. It was a fun game and we came across some cool books! Just wanted to put it out there if anyone else wanted a fun game to find new books. Just remember to be respectful in the library!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Downtown_Isopod_8834\"> /u/Downtown_Isopod_8834 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j5aa0w/date_night_for_a_new_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j5aa0w/date_night_for_a_new_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Anyone know of any books that catch that vibe of the zone and puts the characters in situations where they face unknown and immense danger? I also loved the atmosphere it created that fills you with dread and despair.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SWANSEA_TIL_I_DIE\"> /u/SWANSEA_TIL_I_DIE </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j5a7m1/only_read_one_fictional_book_before_loved_it_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j5a7m1/only_read_one_fictional_book_before_loved_it_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",
