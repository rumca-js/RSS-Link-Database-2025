        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I released my new album \u2018Amiga Me\u2019 today, which I recorded entirely on an Amiga 500 (apart from the vocals, which were done on Ableton). My partner found an old a500 in a local junk shop for \u00a350 (having not used one in almost 30 years), which we then did up\u2026installing a Raspberry Pi/PiStorm into where the original CPU was. This gave me unlimited capacity to work on music, using OctaMED v.5. This was the start of 2024 and by November the album was done. I\u2019d never used OctaMED before but I had loads of fun working in a new and different way to my usual.</p> <p>Hope you enjoy as much as I enjoyed recording it. Who needs 24 bit audio when 8 will do?

I have 2 sega master system controllers and 2 sega mega drive controllers but I heard it&#39;s not a good idea to use the latter with an amiga. I saw a post of someone using the former to play turrican.
