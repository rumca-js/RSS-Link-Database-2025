A good TV antenna will bring in anywhere from 20 to more than 100 channels, depending on where you live. The stations are free, don\u2019t require a broadband connection (with the exception of some ATSC 3.0 channels using encryption), and boast higher resolution and picture quality than cable or streaming options like Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not all antennas are created equal, and there are big differences between indoor and outdoor models. Indoor antennas are supremely convenient, if not always aesthetically pleasing, but a rooftop antenna is always better than one in your home\u2019s attic, which is always better than one that\u2019s installed indoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need more guidance on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2625670/how-to-choose-best-tv-an",
