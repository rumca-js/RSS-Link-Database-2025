Among these machines, proteins stand out, with enzymes being the most notable. These catalytic entities dramatically accelerate essential metabolic reactions by many orders of magnitude, facilitating the very processes that sustain life. While it has long been acknowledged that enzymes undergo movements during their catalytic cycles, measuring and predicting these internal motions and forces has proven extremely challenging.",

UVM researchers found that large, downed trees in streams tie up tremendous stores of carbon\u2014and this pool of carbon storage is growing over time. Moreover, large trees in streamside forests proved important for recruiting carbon into streams over time\u2014reflecting the environmental value of big, old trees.",
