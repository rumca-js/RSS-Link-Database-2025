I need some insight about the possibility of having a NAS that is off most of the time with a more efficient 24/7 server that can store temporarily file changes and offload to the NAS once per day, maybe.</p> <p>The idea would be to have two or three PCs backed up by a NAS but, as the NAS would preferably be off as muchas possible, it will be a minipc server that would synchronize changes in real time (and keep only the delta) when the PCs are on and then offload to the actual backup despite the PCs being on or off. </p> <p>This is motivated by me having an older PC that used to use as a server than can accept HDDs and then a modern minipc that is faster and more energy efficient that can run other services on containers. </p> <p>ChatGPT is telling me about rsync and restic but I think he is hallucinating the idea of the middleman delta buffering.

Nothing explicitly states that, so I\u2019m clueless. I&#39;ve also now tried with normal SAS hdd&#39;s and still no drives detected so I really am lost.
