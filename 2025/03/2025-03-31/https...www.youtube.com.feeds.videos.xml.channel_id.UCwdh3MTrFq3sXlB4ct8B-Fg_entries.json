        "description": "How many bits could a bits box box if a bits box could box bits? Well, seeing as it isn\u2019t sentient and doesn\u2019t have arms or hands, probably not many. But what it can do really well is organise your spare Warhammer pieces, ready for you to plunder for an amazing kitbash! \n\nToday Jake runs through the making of a bits box and makes some cool Emperor\u2019s Children Terminators at the same time! \n\nIf you're new to painting, our Citadel Colour Painting Essentials playlist hosts an array of beginner-friendly videos to help you get started.\n\nFollow for more Warhammer, more often:\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/warhammerofficial/\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/\n- X: https://x.com/warhammer\n- Warhammer Community: https://www.warhammer-community.com/\n- Get Warhammer in your inbox: https://ow.ly/6SJq50T3NL1",
