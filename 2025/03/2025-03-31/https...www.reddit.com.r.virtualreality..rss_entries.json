But there are still diamonds in the rough and PCVR offers an unbeatable experience for high-resolution horror games, racing/flight simulators and even playing older RPGs like Fallout and Skyrim (both of which can immerse you for 100+ hours).</p> <p>But yeah, despite all of this, people still make VR out to be a dead platform to build on, which I cannot help but disagree with.

I recently had a knee injury that has left me unable to stand/walk for at least 8 more weeks. I took this opportunity to delve into the world of VR seeing as how I suddenly have a lot more free time. After some searching, I opted for the Vive XR Elite. It&#39;s been pretty fun, but since I&#39;m relegated to a seated position, I&#39;m way too short in VR to reach/see the things I need to reach/see. Is there any way to adjust my player height in a game like Blade and Sorcery? Also any suggestions for games that are easy to play while seated would be great.

They have points of interest users can click on to either watch an embedded 2D video, read some text, or move to a different 360 photo.</p> <p>Microsoft is disabling SharePoint Spaces this August and I need to find an alternative for these trainings. I&#39;ve done some research but I&#39;m having trouble seeing through all the goddamn marketing. I don&#39;t need bells and whistles, I just need to embed assets in a 360 photo and move between photos. I need the spaces to be accessible by different people, but they shouldn&#39;t interact, it a solo training experience. I&#39;m looking for recommendations on cheap or free alternatives that fulfill this need. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",

The flat-to-3d community is thriving and more and more community members are releasing public profiles for games (profiles are basically settings that allow for different controls/rendering modes to be set as soon as you load in without requiring the know-how of navigating the UEVR menu). For example the Ready or Not profile by pande4360 has full motion controls, gesture based reloading and weapon switching/flashlight toggle. The hogwarts legacy profile has gesture based spell casting. Cyberpunk in VR (not UEVR and without motion controls) lets you navigate night city with a completely new perspective, made even more playable on older GPUs with the recent release of DLSS4.</p></li> <li><p>PSVR2 users are eating with all of the exclusives",

My budget is in the $600 range but something cheaper would leave some cash for accessories. Some of the reasons i want to upgrade are for better passthrough, newer features, and for the Q3, the hand tracking, and the massive game library is pretty nice, even though I primarily use PCVR. Plus alot of quest exclusives. Pico on the other hand has a way better strap, a very good mic, comes with 2 trackers, and imo has better passthrough. plus im quite familiar with the Pico 4 so it would be a smooth transition. I dont know a whole lot about the pros and cons of the Q3 so let me know if it beats out the P4 in any aspects im missing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MultiGeneratorr\"> /u/MultiGeneratorr </",

I bought my Oculus Quest 3 few days ago and wanted give simracing a shot. This was a good occasion to buy myself a LMU aswell. Is it normal to play with 50-70 fps in daily online race, all settings low, default oculus link settings? Could it be because or CPU? Im thinking about getting 5700x3d as it&#39;s the best one for am4 socket. Would it get better or i&#39;m just doing sth wrong.</p> <p>The game is running low fps and god, the outside of the car is so blurry, hard to see past few meters away!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/paweleqqk3333\"> /u/paweleqqk3333 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jnx884/bad_lmu_framerate/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jnx884/bad_lmu_framerate/\">[comments]</a></span>",
