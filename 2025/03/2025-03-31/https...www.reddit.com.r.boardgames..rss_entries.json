For those of you who have also played Uprising, which of the 3 expansions (Ix/Immortality/Bloodlines) do you think are the most worthwhile in combination with Uprising and why? </p> <p>Also, should I ever consider getting the original Dune Imperium to combine the two? Which elements of the original Dune can be implemented into Uprising and does it actually make the game better?</p> <p>Feel free to add any thoughts you might have on Uprising and its expansions or Uprising in combination with original Dune.

My group really enjoys Savernake Forest. We think the play style and the artwork of Railroad Tiles look quite appealing. However, max 4 player for the lighter game is a bummer. And the deluxe edition is way out of my budget for this game.</p> <p>-Natera: New Beginnings- I absolutely adore the artwork. It is very appealing when a game marketing itself as a combination of all popular titles (Dune Imperium, Terrforming Mars, Lost ruins of Arnak...) I am almost sold just on the premise that I get to experience tech tree &amp; track movement in one game. But i am not so sure about the core mechanic being resource management.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was playing quacks of quedlinburg with my family, and it was getting heated. We were in the action phase after everyone decided to stop before blowing up. My mom had a mask token, and she chose the yellow tree token. In the version we played, the yellow token removes the white one. She removed her white 3, and decided to keep playing since she does not have 7 anymore. </p> <p>I thought this was fine, but my brother and dad said she was cheating. All the other tokens get used during the action phase, so how come she can\u2019t use hers? I thought the goal was to not explode. As long as she doesn\u2019t have 7, she can keep going in my eyes. Especially since you can still rack up masks, use mushrooms, get a ruby from the green spider, etc. We couldn\u2019t find anything about this in the rule book. This has also not happened before. Thoughts? </p> <p>Thank you in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Presse",
