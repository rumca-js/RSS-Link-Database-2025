I firstly probed ground and one side of the resistor and got the same 4.83V. But, when I probed ground and the other side of the resistor, I got 4.67V. </p> <p>I know that the resistor is meant for lowering the voltage, but is 4.67V enough for Paula to run properly?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/saintnigo\"> /u/saintnigo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",

You had 2 small aircraft carriers, a blue one and a red one, each on their half of the screen (top and bottom, it was horizontally divided). Your goal was to fly over with your tiny aircraft and (i think) destroy the other players carrier, while shooting at each other.
