Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t support ATOM which is evidently what reddit has changed to. It also doesn&#39;t like the fact that reddit likes to wrap their images in a webpage.</p> <p>So, I created this handy little PHP tool that will convert any subreddit with a feed to RSS. I&#39;m not sure if it works with private subreddits (I haven&#39;t tried), but it does work for the rest.</p> <p>You can download this script at my <a href=\"https://github.com/vestrainteractive/RedditToRss\">github repo</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/vestrainteractive/RedditToRss\">https://github.com/vestrainteractive/RedditToRss</a>) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dietrichmd\"> /u/dietrichmd </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1jo38bg/subreddit_to_rss_script/\"",

I find it extremely ironic that many of the tools I see advertised here do not have an RSS feed configured for your changelog or blog. </p> <p>I know you are all extremely busy and overworked, but if you can add this request to the backlog, I assure you that I will give it a follow and the odds that I download or try your tool as you develop new features is exponentially higher. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one that would appreciate such an addition. </p> <p>I&#39;m very grateful for all the hardwork all of you developers put into your projects and in keeping the RSS framework alive and well.
