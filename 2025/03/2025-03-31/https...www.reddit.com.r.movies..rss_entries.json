Maybe not the best alien movie ever made, but the one that you personally love and could watch over and over and over again. For me, personally, it\u2019s War of the Worlds (2005). I think it\u2019s a perfect mix of cinematography, acting, thrills, terror, action, and overall fun.

But that was a long time ago and nothing since. These authors have a wide selections of mysteries, some with interesting reoccurring characters, set in places from the frigid Arctic to the deepest jungles. Better yet, these stories usually end up having twist endings with rational explanations, more or less, for the unspeakable horrors encountered. And yet no movies to groove on. The unconventional FBI agent Pendergast would have made an interesting franchise character. (I think he could have been played by a young Johnny Depp twenty years ago.) I really like Thunderhead and Still Life with Crows.

The difference in treatment between rodents (rats and squirrels), and he also revels in the nickname awarded to him by the french (the jew hunter).</p> <p>He also describes his ability to think like two different beasts, the hawk and the rat, which make him perfect for his role. For most of the film, he is positioned as a hawk as it\u2019s beneficial but by the end we see his ability to align his identity with that of the rat to carve his name on the right side of history.</p> <p>I also noticed the constant readjustment of his badges throughout the film which I attributed to his receptivity to public opinion and general desire for respect. It makes why he\u2019d prefer to be seen as a double agent rather than a soldier turned halfway through the war.</p> </",

Bond is basically a rookie, full of arrogance, impulsive hot headedness and self belief. Eva Green steals almost every scene and the chemistry between Bond and Vesper is off the charts. Le Chiffre is a good foil to Bond. Whereas Bond has a very blas\u00e9 attitude to his superiors and doesnt feel threatened by them, you always feel the shadow of his bosses loom large over LeChiffre, he always seems extremely tense and on edge. Also You Know My Name is a perfect match, lyrically and musically.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t like Quantum of Solace when it was released, but I actually really enjoyed it on rewatch.

What&#39;s more, I think they basically got it right about what happens after you die, which is pretty much in line with the Buddhist and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. However, I&#39;d say the movie embraces too many superficial yuppie values from the 80s, with very little focus on how your actions affect others, not just yourself. What about the 30 or so people he accidentally killed on the bus? Shouldn&#39;t he have been punished for their deaths?
