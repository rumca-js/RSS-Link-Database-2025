This is partly musings on what I can find so far and partly an invitation/request for comment, particularly on the Webkit side.</p> <p>What I&#39;m most interested in is the security properties of browsers available on Linux with respect to host/browser isolation, tab to tab isolation, and privacy (ie isolating browsing activity from the vendor(s))</p> <p>As far as running natively, Chromium based browsers seem to have the most robust sandboxing - they use user namespaces and seccomp-BPF to create a multi-layer, hardened sandbox.
