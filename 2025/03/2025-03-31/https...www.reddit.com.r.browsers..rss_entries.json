However, over time, its development slowed down, leading to the creation of IronFox as its successor. &quot;IronFox&quot; aims to continue Mull&#39;s legacy by providing a secure, hardened, and privacy-oriented browsing experience. Given this history, do you think &quot;IronFox&quot; is a good choice for privacy-focused users? How does it compare to other browsers like Mull or Firefox? I should note that I\u2019m specifically looking for Firefox-based browsers and prefer not to use Chromium-based options. I\u2019m also seeking advice on the best privacy-focused browser overall.

Plus, it was maintained by a single developer and still managed to be faster than the Great and Powerful Google. That alone deserves at least some respect. It was faster, used less RAM, and was an absolute gem\u2014especially since it still had Google Sync. And so, my story with Thorium began. </p> <p>Then, not too long ago, Chrome started phasing out uBlock Origin and pushing Manifest v3 step by step. There are other Chromium-based browsers, but Thorium felt much closer to Chrome than any of them. They even looked identical \u2014 just one was faster. So, intuitively, I thought Thorium would also be forced to play by the new rules. </p> <p>That\u2019s when I started considering switching to another browser. I was reading <a",

Right now, I mainly use Brave, but I&#39;m thinking of giving Edge a shot. I also use Firefox for work.</p> <p>My PC is a bit on the mid-low end:</p> <ul> <li>Ryzen 5 3600</li> <li>16GB RAM</li> <li>Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB</li> </ul> <p>Here&#39;s the thing: I tend to have a TON of tabs open, which really eats up my RAM. Plus, I&#39;m usually running Slack, Discord, the terminal, and a few other programs at the same time.</p> <p>With these specs, and considering my heavy multitasking, what browser would you recommend for general use and maybe some light gaming? I&#39;m looking for something that&#39;s fast, efficient, and won&#39;t hog too many resources.</p> <p>Any thoughts on Edge vs. Brave, especially when dealing with lots of tabs? Or should I stick with Firefox for everything, even with all these apps running?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help! </",
