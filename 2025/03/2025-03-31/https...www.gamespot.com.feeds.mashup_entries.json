        "description": "<p>The slogan \u201cStand and Fight\u201d has been plastered all over Doom: The Dark Ages marketing: a catchphrase that feels at odds with the modern Doom series. Doom 2016 was applauded for its fast gameplay and Doom: Eternal took that one step further with the Meat Hook that let you whip around the battlefield at breakneck speeds. The movement--for many--is what makes Doom, Doom. So to see Doom: The Dark Ages\u2019 encourage players to hold their ground and fight seemed antithetical to that finely tuned formula. At least, that\u2019s what I thought. After three hours of hands-on time with id Software\u2019s next shooter, it seems like Doom: The Dark Ages has found a hypnotic balance between its iconic fast-paced gameplay and the blow-for-blow combat that Dark Ages is bringing to the mix.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to Doom 2016.
