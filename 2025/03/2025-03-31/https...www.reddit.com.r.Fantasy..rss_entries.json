Then my mom passed away at the end of January and I&#39;m just now picking up books again. Also, I&#39;m a mood reader so planning to read books for a certain prompt sometimes just get left to dangle.</p> <p>But I only missed Bingo by 5 books. Here&#39;s what I read:</p> <p><strong>First in a series:</strong> <em>Rivers of London</em> by Ben Aaronovitch. A little Dresdin, a little police procedural, all urban fantasy, RoL scratched an itch for me that I had been looking for. I listend on audio format and I loved the narrator, he really made the character of Peter Grant for me. My only gripe was all the male gaze we&#39;re put through, not unlike early Dresdin. Wizards got one thing their minds apparently. 4/5 stars</p> <p><stron",

Some friends did their own listening party for Taylor Swift&#39;s new album. I followed along, listened to the album, and realized that there was something about this artist that I <em>really</em> liked. My friends made a curated playlist for me so I could check out some of her other music. I should note that musically speaking, I live under a rock. Prior to 2024, I didn&#39;t listen to music much, if at all, and if you had asked me, I could have named exactly one (1) Taylor Swift song. I didn&#39;t know anything about her except that she was mega-famous and a very savvy business woman. I admired her but assumed her songs were all light hearted pop without much depth. Wow, that sentence hurts me to write now. </p> <p>After listening to my playlist a few times, I realized that Tay",

When I read it I was fascinated and I couldn&#39;t help but finish reading until I finished the volumes published at that time. Since that time I have followed the story until now, with 22 volumes published so far, the works of Patrick Ruffus had already made me get into fantasy literature but these novels made me love books and fantasy, with a story that was different from what I had read at that time and being a work of the isekai genre I was surprised that it was something very different outside of the clich\u00e9",

Before the war with the Orcs the Holy Light was exclusively used by priests for healing and meditation, the thought of using it in combat went against the tenants of the Church. But when the orcs became an existential threat the Alliance agreed they needed to use every asset at their disposal and so the priests relented and taught their magic to warrior who went on to become Paladins using the power of the Light to strengthen themselves and vanquish their foes. Overall it was just a common sense decision with no negative consequences down the line as the WoW universe has many other threats to occupy people&#39;s time.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to read a fantasy book with a similar premise where the decision does lead to negative repercussions down the line.
