        "description": "Taiwanese authorities have accused 11 Chinese companies, including SMIC, of secretly setting up disguised entities in Taiwan to illegally recruit tech talent from firms like Intel and Microsoft. The Register reports: One of those companies is apparently called Yunhe Zhiwang (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd and develops high-end network chips. The Bureau claims its chips are used in China's \"Data East, Compute West\" strategy that, as we reported when it was announced in 2022, calls for five million racks full of kit to be moved from China's big cities in the east to new datacenters located near renewable energy sources in country's west. Datacenters in China's east will be used for latency-sensitive applications, while heavy lifting takes place in the west. Staff from Intel and Microsoft were apparently lured to work for Yunhe Zhiwang, which disguised its true ownership by working through a Singaporean company.\n \nThe Investigation Bureau also alleged that China's largest chipmaker, Semi",

The charge related to committing an unauthorised act which risked damaging national security.\n \nArshad, from Rochdale in Greater Manchester, is said to have transferred sensitive data from a secure computer to his phone, which he had taken into a top secret area of GCHQ on 24 August 2022. [...] The court heard that Arshad took his work mobile into a top secret GCHQ area and connected it to work station. He then transferred sensitive data from a secure, top secret computer to the phone before taking it home, it was claimed. Arshad then transferred the data from the phone to a hard drive connected to his personal home computer. \"Seriously? What on earth was the UK's equiv",

Now, as of March 2025, Honey is down to 16 million users on Chrome, down from its peak of 20 million.\n \nThis drop comes after new Chrome policy has taken effect which prevents Honey, and extensions like it, from practices including taking over affiliate codes without disclosure or without benefit to the extension's users.

Paid reviews were completed one day faster on average. In a more dramatic result, Biology Open saw reviews completed in 4.6 business days when paying reviewers $284 per review, versus 38 days for unpaid reviews. \"For the editors it has been extremely helpful because, prior to this, in some areas it was very difficult to secure reviewers,\" said Alejandra Clark, managing editor of Biology Open.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Publishers+Trial+Paying+Peer+Reviewers+-+What+Did+They+Find%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F03%2F31%2F162212%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_med",
