This isn't just a 'Doom in the olden days' reskin - Doom with a shield and a flail and a furry black Jon Snow cape - but a proper revision of how the series works. Ironically, given the setting, it's also the most modern-feeling of the Doom games, with a much more pronounced story than we've had before, a greatly expanded character-upgrade system that borders on skill-tree territory, and open-zoned sandbox levels you can return to and explore at your own pace. This feels like an experience built from a thicker pitch document than we've ever had before. And while I both admire the desire for change, and acknowledge the need for it - Doom Eternal didn't leave many places to go - I'm not entirely convinced about The Dark Ages yet. There's undeniable Doom magic here but there are",

I gather now, having looked at a few wikis, that this is not entirely true. But back in the mid-1990s when I first encountered this weird, horrifying video game, it certainly felt true. I Have No Mouth was... not a hit, exactly, but certainly the subject of a sustained mania in my student house at the tail end of the last century. Adventure games, or point-and-clicks, were our collective favourite genre, outside of endless sessions on Worms 2. Back then we recognised that, even amongst the Monkey Islands and Tentacles, I Have No Mouth was...special?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/on-consoles-thirty-years-after-its-release-theres-still-no-escape-from-i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-screams-horrors\">Read more</a></p>",
