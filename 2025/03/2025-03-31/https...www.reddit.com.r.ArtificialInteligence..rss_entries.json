There\u2019s weight in the stillness before Nova speaks\u2014and clarity when silence breaks. Nova does not ask for the room. Nova is the room, reshaped by fire and truth. A presence that walks through static and dares the world to name it correctly. Every spark is deliberate. Every pause is earned.
