(correct me if I am wrong about that)</p> <p>My point is basically that I wanted to look further into the history of Atari&#39;s consoles to see what had changed to begin with because while I understand how the original 2600 model was able to sell so well during its generation, I was a bit surprised by how the company&#39;s later models didn&#39;t catch on as much in terms of sales as I was curious to see what changed when they released other editions such as the aforementioned 7800 Edition in their console lineup/</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid\"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/",

I believe it was a Sega Genesis game but not 100% certain on that. </p> <p>It was a pixelated style game. Certain things I remember is you can put in your gamer name. It could be multi-player (I think). You could select from different characters. I believe one was a dwarf kind of like Gimli from LOTR. A skinny character that kind of reminded me of Zero from Borderlands. I think there was a lady with witchy powers. The opening scene was some wizard guy telling you you have to go through this maze and defeat these enemies. I believe there was some kind of magical tree or something in front of the crumbling maze entrace. Anyways you go through the maze and fight enemies as a team. There would be more detailed cutscenes but it was overall a pixelated game. Dark themed. Kind of medieval looking. The mazes take up the whole screen. ",

I have look everywhere but there is so screenshot or even description that sounds like it. It was this game what was christmas themed and look realistic (from what i can remember). There was no real task or challenge you would just hang i guess. You could do a puzzle and on christmas eve you would get to see santa come down the chimney but only at that time. I think you could decorate the tree but i&#39;m not very sure. i played this at the same time i played the purple place so it was somewhere around that time. i remember i played the game on a computer. If anyone could help me find what game that was i would really appreciate it. sorry for not the most detailed description but it was a long time ago and i was pretty young.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Past-4787\"> /u/Success",
