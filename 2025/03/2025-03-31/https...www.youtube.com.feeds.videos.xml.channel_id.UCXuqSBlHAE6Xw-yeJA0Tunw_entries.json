        "description": "The second season of our original PC-building reality series is back from 2015 \u2013 and it's BIGGER, WETTER, and in ONE VIDEO. Luke and Linus face off with a twist: they each have a $500 budget, but this time, they MUST water cool their rigs\u2026 using no off-the-shelf PC cooling gear. Junkyard radiators? Fish tank pumps? Soda bottle reservoirs? All fair game.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1607386-we-built-a-500-water-cooled-pc-with-junk-parts-%E2%80%93-scrapyard-wars-2-complete/\n\n\u25ba GET OUR MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba GET A VPN: http://www.piavpn.com/linus\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\nCHAPTERS\n---------------------------------------------------\n0:00 Intro\n0:26 Episode 1\n14:57 Episode 2\n30:02 Episode 3\n44:26 Episode 4\n1:00:24 Episode 5\n1:21:56 Credits",
