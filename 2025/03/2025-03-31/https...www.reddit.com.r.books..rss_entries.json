I&#39;ve enjoyed her other novels and just could never get into it. </p> <p>Well since I heard it was set in 2025, so that gave me the push I needed. I know I&#39;m a bit sensitive right now, but I have never had a book disturb me as much this one. There is basically every kind of trigger warning possible. What was really disturbing was how feasible her vision was. Books like The Road or 1984 are so extreme that they don&#39;t feel real. I feel like I could wake up in a few months and inhabit her version of America. The balance of forced normalcy and the extreme horrors of humanity just hit me harder than any book recently has. </p> <p>It&#39;s not a perfect book, but I haven&#39;t had a book make me think like this in a long time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dioscuride",

The romance felt rushed with little buildup; while I initially enjoyed the main character&#39;s interactions, that faded, and I just wanted to finish the book to see if it improved.

I thought I was going to love it just like everyone else. </p> <p>But unfortunately, I didn&#39;t. I thought it was very boring. I found the characters quite insubstantial, flat, passive, and lacking personality, and the narration was mostly dry and lifeless. The story didn&#39;t evoke any feelings in me, even though it is usually described as being very sad. I felt very distant from both the story and Stoner himself, so it was hard for me to actually care. I think Dave Masters described Stoner perfectly when he said that he was cut out for failure and that he would never fight the world, because he was just so passive throughout the novel.
