To keep the project active and sustainable, I intend to commercialize it, so I won\u2019t be making it open source.</p> <p>Thank you for your understanding!<br/> You can check out what I\u2019ve built so far here: <a href=\"https://test.codersbud.com/auth/sign-in\">https://test.codersbud.com/auth/sign-in</a>.</p> <p>I will explain everything in details about project if anyone i",

Paul Graham has published all his essays on his blog since the early days of YC.</p> <p>The main challenge I faced was finding enough time to read them\u2014many essays span several pages. For a long time, I\u2019ve dreamed of a service that could transform these essays into audiobooks, but I couldn\u2019t find anything convenient. So, we decided to create our own.</p> <p>We\u2019ve built an app where you can listen to all 227 of Paul Graham\u2019s essays as audiobooks for free.

Most products get buried within hours, never reaching their potential audience.</p> <p>So I created Top10 out of sheer frustration.</p> <p>The concept is simple: only 10 products compete daily. That&#39;s it. No endless scrolling, no overwhelm. Just 10 carefully selected products looking for user votes.</p> <p><strong>Why it works:</strong></p> <p>When I tested the concept with early users, I discovered something interesting. With only 10 options, people actually explored EACH product instead of just the top 2-3.

Now, I\u2019ve joined a startup where we\u2019re building a <strong>fintech product</strong>, and we\u2019ve decided to use React Native for our frontend.<br/> I\u2019m trying to figure out whether <strong>Expo</strong> is the right choice or if we should go with bare React Native. I like the idea of Expo\u2019s easy setup, OTA updates, and faster development, but I\u2019ve heard it has limitations, especially when it comes to native modules, app size, and performance.<br/> Since we\u2019re building a fintech app (which might require native features like biometrics, encryption, or background services), would Expo be a good choice? Or would we hit roadblocks that force us to eject later? </p> <p>Would love to hear your experiences\u2014<strong>is Expo good for fintech apps, or should I avoid it?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",

It helps you explore scientific literature behind any text you&#39;re reading or Youtube video you&#39;re watching.</p> <p>The extension gives you an AI-curated summary of the key findings and links to the papers, making it easier to dig deeper into topics that interest you or verify claims with academic sources. Just select a text or a segment of a YouTube video, and it finds relevant academic papers from Semantic Scholar&#39;s database (covering arXiv, Springer Nature, PubMed, IEEE, etc.).</p> <p>If this sounds like something that could benefit the way you consume online content or your research workflow, feel free to check it out. I&#39;d love to hear any feedback or suggestions you might have to improve it further.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <blockquote> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.go",
