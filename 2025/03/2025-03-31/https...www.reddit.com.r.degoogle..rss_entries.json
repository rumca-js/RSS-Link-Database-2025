Also I know that people say that no service is truly free and you are the product, but I mean replacing Google&#39;s products and services if you were really invested in their ecosystem is a bit of an undertaking and the alternatives can be expensive. Google has granted a lot of control over what dad you share and how they may use it, as well as the means to delete the data. It&#39;s true that one could debate how transparent they are about the extent of their data collection and your ability to exercise control over it, but seriously one could debate it.
