This mini PC has a small DC5V laptop fan which started doing really loud vibration noises and my idea is to remove it and strap a 120mm fan into the miniPC case to cool it down.</p> <p>I am a big noob when it comes to electricity stuff, from my understanding RPI should be capable of doing 5V and 3.3V from GPIO, better off I could wire power and ground to an old USB cable and plug it into the RPI or the miniPC itself. AFAIK this would leverage the current protection of USB, is this correct?</p> <p>If I connect the fan using USB, could I then use the GPIO for the PWM and RPM signal pins? I really dont want to fry my RPI </p> <p>I dont mind the fan going slower cause of the 5V, the CPU is an N100 and it rarely goes above 60\u00baC.
