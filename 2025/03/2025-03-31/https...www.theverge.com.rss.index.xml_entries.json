According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/03/inside-youtube-fake-movie-trailers-1236352406/\">a report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, and Sony Pictures redirected ad revenue to themselves instead of enforcing copyright protections and shutting down the popular Screen Culture and KH Studio trailer accounts. In response, the SAG-AFTRA union has criticized the studios for profiting off videos that use AI to exploit their members\u2019 likenesses without permission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">F",
