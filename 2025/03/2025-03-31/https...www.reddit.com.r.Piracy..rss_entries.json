I got a psvr2 and would like to grab some 3D movies to watch(on PC). I dont want to go through the rigmarole of buying a 3D blue ray player, 3D blue rays and then rip them myself. Seems like too much time, effort and money for the occasional movie. So anyone know of a good place to grab the files? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/why_no_usernames_\"> /u/why_no_usernames_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1joal06/what_would_be_the_best_place_to_download_3d_movies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1joal06/what_would_be_the_best_place_to_download_3d_movies/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Open AI must have used copyrighted material to train their AI and are using it for profit. So if anyone makes a case for this and takes them to court there are 2 things that might happen. They will have to pay for all the damages resulted from them using copyrighted material or they win and are legally allowed to use copyright material which is in my mind legalized piracy. This precedent will allow many people to share pirated stuff without any repurcussions.</p> <p>Earlier the scope of copyright was not that big but with now OPENAI Directly taking it from a studio that too from a different country makes it that much more serious.</p> <p>What are your thoughts on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/flash_vg\"> /u/flash_vg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

Even if it&#39;s not piracy but buying keys, I just got one from nodekeys for under 20 bucks, so even people who don&#39;t want to pirate are definitely not paying the official full price.

I never installed or used Steam because I never saw a problem with installing games with setup.exe before Steam was invented, plus most of my games are pirated anyway. What do the gentle friends in this camp do?</p> <p>I usually try to run the game using Wine, and when that doesn&#39;t work I try with Lutris (which is not an emulator but somehow many games worked through it). If that fails, I&#39;m stuck. Is there a workflow for using Proton without Steam or something similar?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/on_a_quest_for_glory\"> /u/on_a_quest_for_glory </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jns2fd/steam_and_gaming_on",

The only other information I can find on it is that the servers were taken down a few years ago, but I just want to play with the character creator.
