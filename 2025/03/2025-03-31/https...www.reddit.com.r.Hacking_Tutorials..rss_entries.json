I\u2019ve done everything anyone can think of to try to get over this; I bought a new phone, had a new number, deleted old accounts and made new ones on other devices (laptops, iPads, iPhones, etc) but to no avail. She (the hacker) is able to find previously old text messages and deleted photos and etc. of my past when you would think it was gotten rid of long ago and she is causing complications in my personal life, to save the story.</p> <p>We\u2019ve talked previously before becoming vengeful , but we never met physically, had no formal relationship, nothing of the sorts\u2026and eventually I stopped talking to her and she got angry and that\u2019s when she has started to meddle with my life.
