CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed to Bloomberg that the company isn't ready to share more marketing materials until closer to the game's release date, which also hasn't been revealed. Speaking of release dates, Ghost of Y\u014dtei doesn't have one just yet, but more details of the game's plot have been revealed. And finally, the mythical Nintendo DS port of Halo wasn't axed by Microsoft as many believed. According to a developer who worked on it, the game was actually canned by Nintendo.",

While the changes and minor additions don\u2019t particularly innovate on the original, Grand Bazaar is a faithful remake that turns the cuteness up to 11. Just like in Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar, you\u2019re a newbie farmer who somehow also becomes the hustling heart of Zephyr Town\u2019s hyper-local economy. Check out our Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar hands-on with a PC build, exploring this familiar, and yet whole new game.\n\n#StoryOfSeasons #Gaming #IGN",

        "description": "When I went into my hands-on with Doom: The Dark Ages I was prepared for intense violence and high volume heavy metal, but what I didn\u2019t count on was such an exhilarating amount of demon-killing variety. By the end of my two-hour demo I\u2019d used a saw-toothed shield to slice through demons like it was Beelzebub\u2019s Beyblade, stomped around a war-ravaged city as a colossal Mecha-Slayer, and even brought a snarling Cyberdemon to an explosive end by breathing fire directly down its throat with my faithful dragon steed. Talk about a heartwarming moment. Every aspect of it looked and felt incredible. It may take place in the dark ages of the Doom timeline, but the Slayer\u2019s latest slaughterfest might well represent the peak of the series\u2019s modern era. Previewed by Tristan Ogilvie.",
