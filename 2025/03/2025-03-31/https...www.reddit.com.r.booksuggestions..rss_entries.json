In the past I have loved fantasy and realistic fiction but I\u2019m on a dystopian kick right now. Most genes are ok just not historical fiction, non fiction, or romance please (sub plot romance is fine but not main plot romance, no judgment for those who like it just not my thing). Some of my favorite books in the past have been, Harry Potter, See You at Harry\u2019s, Bridge to Terabethia, and I\u2019m in the middle of the Maze Runner series currently.

Looking for\u2026 idk, maybe some fantasy, comedy, something fun to read or maybe with technology? Recommend anything, but please, tell me what the book is about.</p> <p>Here are some books people recommended to me before, along with my thoughts on them:</p> <p>Ready Player One \u2013 I was pleasantly surprised by how different it was from the movie, and I really enjoyed it. The pacing was just right, made me laugh a few times, though I didn\u2019t get like 80% of the references.</p> <p>How to Become a Dark Lord and Die Trying \u2013 Started off really good, but it kept getting worse and kinda boring. Seemed interesting, and I really wanted to keep reading, but it wasn\u2019t worth it. Also, I\u2019m not a native speaker, and the way this book is written made it harder for me ",

The detailed descriptions, as if I were there.

It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s creepy and ghost-like and it comes out, for example, that everything is logically explainable. Or if it&#39;s one scene about folklore. But I have a big problem with poltergeists or ghostly apparitions (which fill most of the book).</p> <p>I have The Thirteenth Tale on my TBR list, but I\u2019d be really happy about more suggestions \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have ZERO clue where to find actual werewolf stories that are good.. lol. I want something with GOOD body horror (not just &quot;he transformed. poof! wow! kinda stuff :]), preferably the main character as the werewolf, and not any of the alpha omega crap (sorry if you&#39;re into that lol). I want the character to be BATTLING with lycanthropy and having jarring descriptions of what it&#39;s like to be a werewolf if that makes any sense. I want it to terrify me! I write werewolf stories all the time, but I can never find one&#39;s that fit my sort of criteria. any suggestions?</p> <p>if not, just give me good psychological horror books :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KosmicKody\"> /u/KosmicKody </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jnqhxh/werewolf_horror_stories/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1j",
