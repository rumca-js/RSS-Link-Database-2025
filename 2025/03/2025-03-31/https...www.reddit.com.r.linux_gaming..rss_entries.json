Everything installed but now I realize what I did wrong in this step, as I only have 20 gb of space to use for games after the Bazzite install. Am I cooked ? Do I need to go back somehow or reinstall windows and do this all over again ? Can I change the partition somehow from the bios ? </p> <p>Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Azurabroods\"> /u/Azurabroods </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jobnyo/help_messed_up_bazzite_install/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jobnyo/help_messed_up_bazzite_install/\">[comments]</a></span>",
