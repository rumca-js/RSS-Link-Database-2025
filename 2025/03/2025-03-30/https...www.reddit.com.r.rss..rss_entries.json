This feature allows users to convert regular inbox items into structured, automatically updated RSS feeds.</p> <p>This is in its earliest phase of development, so it does not yet support queries or filters of any kind - it just creates a feed from any folder. My favorite bit of the UX with this is that the user is able to populate a select with their available folders, ensuring that they aren&#39;t having to guess if a name is right.</p> <p>I love this community and really appreciate all of your awesome feedback and encouragement so far! </p> <p>Check out the repo <a href=\"https://github.com/TBosak/mkfd\">here</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tbosk\"> /u/tbosk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1jn2lez/mkfd_now_supports_email_to_rss_feed_generation/\"",
