If AI replaces majority of jobs, this is actually good for the fed and the president in their fights against inflation. As we all know, inflation has been sticky, and the numbers are always higher than expectation. This is because everybody still makes money, so they can keep buying groceries and paying rents at inflated costs. </p> <p>The only way to fight this is to eliminate most jobs, so the food and apartment cartel can&#39;t charge at insane price anymore. The fed will be then forced to lower interest rate, which is good for small businesses (since most of them start their capital with debts). </p> <p>And those who get replaced by AI shouldn&#39;t be compensated with UBIs either, because UBIs means we will need to print insane amount of money (which will always contribute to inflation).</p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

Bill Gates was recently quoted about 2 day work weeks in as early as 10 years being possible. I think he\u2019s way over hyping AI, but one thing is always avoided when talking about AI\u2026 What about the workforce earning a living once replaced by tech? Is this going to be a economic shock to the workforce or are we going to have a repeat of productivity gains with workers having to work harder as we saw at the turn of the 20th century because we sure as hell aren\u2019t going to see full pay checks and 2 day work weeks with AI!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mackadelik\"> /u/Mackadelik </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1jn3ivh/ai_only_to_make_jobs_easier_and_increase/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><",
