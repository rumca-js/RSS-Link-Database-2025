I spent the past couple days building my first homelab out of an old office machine. Among other things I got jellyfin running on it and my current workflow for getting media onto it is to connect my main machine to my VPN I set up myself using wireguard running on a VPS. Afterwards I just send the downloaded files to my server since it also acts as a NAS and is connected via gigabit. This generally works fine but it would be more streamlined if I could make the downloads happen directly on my jellyfin machine. What is a reasonable way of tackling this? If I were to connect my server to the VPN I would no longer be able to remote into it since its IP changes right? How do you guys handle this?</p> <p>Thanks for your input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Weeblified_Venom\"> /u/Weeblified_Venom </a> <br/> <span><a hre",
