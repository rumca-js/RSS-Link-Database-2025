Whenever characters refer to it, they just call it \u201cthe city\u201d or say things like \u201chere.\u201d This choice is deliberate\u2014it suggests that the events of the film aren\u2019t tied to one specific place but could happen anywhere. The horror and decay we see aren\u2019t just about one city; they reflect something universal.</p> <p>Throughout the movie, we constantly hear the wailing of ambulances and police sirens. We see slums, miserable schools, always bad weather and a general atmosphere of decay. The murders are horrifying, but they aren\u2019t the only signs of rot\u2014the entire city is steeped in misery. This creates a sense that violence and suffering aren\u2019t isolated incidents but rather a symptom of a much larger problem.<",
