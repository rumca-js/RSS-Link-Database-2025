Remember that 64-bit ARMv8 recompiler we added a few months ago? Well now it\u2019s <em>even faster!</em> This release fixes graphical issues in Konami GX arcade games and Philips CD-i software. We\u2019ve added several IGS gambling games, as well as Chinese versions of some Dynax mahjong games. The LinnDrum percussion synthesiser is now working with interactive controls and sound output. And speaking of sound, audio emulation issues in several arcade games have been fixed.</p> <p>PC-88VA emulation is progressing, with fixes for multiple graphics modes. A few more peripherals for the TI-99 computer family are now supported. There have been a few CPU/DSP fixes that should improve Sega 3D arcade game emulation. Psion hand-helds now correctly detect more memory configurations and give better-looking video ",
