This book was so moving and grim, yet such an epic story. I have thought about it multiple times over the years since first reading it, but it is just so odd that it came back to me so vividly in my dreams last night. I just wonder if any other readers have ever experienced a story coming back to them in their dreams many years after reading it. I suppose just an unusual dream experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ReadWithMe_1996\"> /u/ReadWithMe_1996 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnp5sg/giants_in_the_earth/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jnp5sg/giants_in_the_earth/\">[comments]</a></span>",

All the information I need is on the internet (wikipeida, google, google map, google review) I can watch videos of the places I want to visit on YT and I can ask chatbot to plan my trip for me. However, I still enjoy reading travel guidebooks. </p> <p>My top favorite series are </p> <p>1 <strong>Insight Guides</strong></p> <p><strong>2 Lonely Planet</strong></p> <p><strong>3 DK Eyewitness Travel</strong></p> <p><strong>4</strong> <strong>Rough Guides</strong>. </p> <p>I love looking at the pictures in these books and reading them on weekends while relaxing on my sofa. But for real traveling in 2025, the internet is good enough for me. Still, there\u2019s something nostalgic and special about flipping through a beautifully designed travel guide.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",
