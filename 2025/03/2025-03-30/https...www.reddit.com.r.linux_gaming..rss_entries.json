As usual, this will be adjusted in the coming months, no doubt; however, RT has always been pretty bad before. Right now, the difference according to my tests can be between 25 to 45% less performance with RT enabled than Windows. Now, this card has amazing RT performance, which is pretty similar to the 4070ti Super. RT is very usable with FSR 4. I have seen VKD3D team and behind FSR 4 implementation, but do you guys think MESA will now care about optimizing RT properly? I could get it before because only RX 7900XT(X) had decent RT, but now the story is different.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Joker28CR\"> /u/Joker28CR </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jnpsyc/do_you_think_mesa_drivers_will_actually_care_more/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ww",

However, whenever I launch the game using this option, it doesn&#39;t save any changes to settings and I have to agree to the EULA every time (I have no issues when using the default non-Proton setting). Every time the game lauches, it says &quot;updating executable&quot;, which also seems odd. I think it must be some kind of issue with the reading/writing of the config files, but saves do work which are stored in the same area. Does anyone know what could be the cause of this issue?
