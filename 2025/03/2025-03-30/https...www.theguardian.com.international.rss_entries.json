Some years the blooms are massive enough to draw tourists from around the world to revel in the fields, such as in 2023 when more than 100,000 people showed up on a weekend to gawk at the poppies in Lake Elsinore, a small city about an hour outside Los Angeles.</p><p>But this year, not so much. Thanks to a brutally dry winter, the hills around the usual southern California superbloom hotspots have been conspicuously bare. Callista Turner, a state park ranger, could count the number of blooms on two hands as she surveyed the 8 miles of rolling hills at the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve in the final week of March, which is typically when superbloom season peaks. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting to see what",

I don\u2019t have kids of my own, but while helping with raising Lucy\u2019s offspring, I have since realised the high stakes of shaping young minds \u2013 and how different siblings can be. Lucy\u2019s kittens may have come from the same womb and suckled from the same teats in the same basket, but they have markedly different personalities: one of them is chilled and curious, another chases anything that moves and the third is skittish in the extreme.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/30/she-treats-everyone-with-a-deep-growl-can-you-t",

A typical dinner was one of a spicy noodle dish glowing red with chilli followed by a pale and gently flavoured panna cotta. A sort of whip-and-kiss effect that followed that of the week\u2019s see-saw between icy mornings and blissful afternoons with the sun on our backs.</p><p>I used two hits of chilli for the noodles \u2013 a thick, brick-red Korean paste in which to toss the strings of noodles hot from their steaming water and then flakes of dried chilli added to the breadcrumbs I used to finish the dish. A double hit of chilli, but still producing an effect that was warm and aromatic, rather than blow-your-socks-off hot.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/mar/30/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-noodles-with-breadcrumbs-and-panna-cotta-with-passion-fruit\">Continue reading...</",
