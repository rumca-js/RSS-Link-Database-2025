        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I have a friend who is a trans woman who is planning on traveling by plane to Texas in the next month, she does not keep up with US politics, we live in a blue state so this will be national, not international travel. I have been trying to find resources so that she can be more aware of the risks associated with the trip, I feel bad for discouraging her, but I fear for her safety, and I want to make sure that she is as informed as possible. So, if you have any links to news articles or other resources about the danger so that I can give them to her that would be incredible.
