I love reading engineering blogs, but I found it difficult having to go to so many different places to keep up with content from across the industry. To fix that (and to have some fun), I built CommitLog \u2013 a free site that aggregates software company blogs, generates summaries, and makes them searchable by topic.</p> <p>I\u2019ve only been working on this for a few weeks, so there\u2019s still a lot to improve! Right now, I manually curate articles that I think are worthwhile to try and surface more signal than noise from the endless ocean of software blogs out there. Each article also links to the original source, so if a summary catches your interest, you can easily dive deeper.</p> <p>This started as a way to keep up with industry trends while also playing around with Go and Remix.js.

Cold DMs, emails, and follow-ups. 50+ messages/day using automation tools (Instoo, Lemlist, Gmass). Personalized intros, no generic spam.</p> <p>Step 3: Built Authority Fast We created short form content on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts documenting our journey and sharing tips.

You pop it open on any site, ask what you need, and keep moving.</p> <p>We kept using it after the hackathon and it\u2019s been surprisingly useful.

While I\u2019ve had some success here and there, generally it\u2019s been a pretty bad experience. It\u2019s gotten harder to get matches, and when I do, we often don\u2019t click, especially when it comes to core values. I\u2019m pretty conservative and Christian.</p> <p>I decided to start building a dating app that tries to fix this. Instead of endless swiping, the app uses a short personality quiz to learn about a user, then matches you based on people you are highly likely to be compatible with (science-backed). Over time, the app will learn from your matches and improve your future matches \u2014 kind of like a feedback loop for compatibility.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning to make it completely free to start, and I\u2019d genuinely love to hear what you think. Would something like this interest you? Are there features or ideas you\u2019d want to see in an app like this? Any feedback is super appreciated \u2014 I\u2019d love",

It can ingest your documentation, generate a suitable set of work items\u2014capturing concrete tasks and a deployment strategy that accounts for dependencies\u2014and create these work items for you.</p> <p>Why SpunUp?</p> <p>In my job, I often find myself having to translate non-technical, product focused documentation into a well-defined set of work items for myself and others to follow. While in some instances this can be trivial, larger features, external dependencies, and iterative releases can quickly add complexity and demand more care and attention.

Thus, did I decided to build a Java-based framework to build web application.</p> <p>I am currently 3 months-in, and I would say that I&#39;ve put almost 200 hours into this project, from research, documentation and conception. I&#39;m left about 2 months before I have to show it off in front, of well, the entire IT departement ahaha.</p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;m really looking for feedbacks, either positive or negatives as we are doing this in solo, and that&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a competition, nobody really wants to help nobody and that&#39;s okay, it&#39;s part of the game. Thus, I turn to reddit to help me improve over my project.</p> <p><a href=\"http://jolt-framework.org\">jolt-framework.org</a></p> <p>Thanks,<br/> T1WiLLi :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
