Package 8lpa,internship:25k I have tried for jobs over campus placement but no luck. I really did want a dev/devops/AI role. But again placement season is ending and off campus also it&#39;s not helping for me. I got one company but they haven&#39;t called me yet and over there role is not specified and internship is extended for 1 year and no full time guarantee.</p> <p>Now here,I thought I&#39;ll learn something as implementation analyst but there&#39;s no coding at all. Just a client facing role and if I break bond I have i pay between 1.5-2lpa.</p> <p>I&#39;m scared if I made the right decision take it or should I have waited for m",
