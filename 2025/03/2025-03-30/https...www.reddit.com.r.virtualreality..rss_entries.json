It is a bit jerky, but look unbelievable good. So this is okay and yes I used one of the profiles from the UEVR profile page.

Never owned a VR Headset before but now I\u2019m considering picking one up and could use some purchase advice.</p> <p>So for context I\u2019m a Playstation 5 user, sometimes I binge video games on it and sometimes I drop those for weeks to months and only use the console for video and audio media. But for the most part, I use the console fairly often in my daily life. </p> <p>I was considering getting a PSVR 2 but I wasn\u2019t ecstatic about it. I figured the VR gaming industry still had room for growth, so maybe next gen.</p> <p>Recently, however, I came across this Meta Quest app called Ace Virtual Shooting and the reviews are generally positive across the board. Better range shooting as a result, good tracking, nice controller, safe pistol dry fire training simulator you can use at home, etc. Seen multiple online reviews as well as video reviews backing this thing, not to mention Max Michel is on the bandwagon too. <",
