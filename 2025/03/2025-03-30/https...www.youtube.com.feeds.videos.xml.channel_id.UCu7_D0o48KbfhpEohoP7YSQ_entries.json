        "description": "Yes, here in Switzerland, we actually have atomic bunkers\u2014but, you know, we're practical folks. Why waste a perfectly good underground fortress waiting for nuclear doom when it can double as a car parking? And as the home for our Smart Meters. A nod to Batman\u2019s secret lair, if you will. \nToday's engineering challenge is clear: Can I successfully capture the Smart Meter signals buried deep beneath layers of reinforced concrete and stream that data to my Grafana dashboard?\nWill I impress you with Swiss ingenuity, or will I end up banging my head against the walls of the bunker? Stick around because either way, it's going to get interesting.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nLoRa32 boards: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_okKvXKH\nBackup Battery: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oCuqRSN\ngPlug M: https://gplug.ch/produkte/gplugm/\n\nSketches: https://github.com/SensorsIot/MQTT-Extender\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links abo",
