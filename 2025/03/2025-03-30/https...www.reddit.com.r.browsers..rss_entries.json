Ive been using Chrome at the moment which has a setting to block image files on websites and in search, however I am hard pressed to find an equivalent that does the same for video files as well.

Get rid of unnecessary icons from the toolbar. Once you&#39;re done and have a replacement New Tab page and search set to Google, (I stopped using the built in new tab because I think they tried to embed a search bar from Bing instead of just having a regular browser one, breaking dark mode) just enable Mica in the flags and enable Vertical Tabs. You could say you&#39;re (kind of*) saving RAM this way, because Chrome has the overhead of running a whole browser while Edge runs in the background (I&#39;m not sure how often and how much RAM usage) of Windows anyway. Looks visually appealing and runs great. I don&#39;t know why it can&#39;t come like this out of the box, then everyone would like it much more.

I know I&#39;m not supposed to use ai(/s), in fact a lot of batch debloat script for brave outright disable leo, but I actually like ai in a browser, it helps me summarise poorly written and intentionally undeceiferable news articles. But leo with it&#39;s current state is just plain bad at it. Just copy pasting the website link on any recent ai does way better job of summarising.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Heisenbergxyz\"> /u/Heisenbergxyz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1jn2lll/rant_about_braves_leo_ai/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1jn2lll/rant_about_braves_leo_ai/\">[com",
