I don\u2019t like memorizing words, but I like traveling in Japan. I sometimes look at signs and try to figure out what they mean. I started to wonder, how much of the language could you learn this way? Could you learn to understand complicated ideas, just by observing and guessing in an immersive environment?</p> <p>So to Speak is a puzzle game where you wander around a 2D simulation of Japan and encounter Japanese words in signs and conversations. You must connect them to nearby objects or text with the same meaning. For example, you can drag a Japanese sign for &quot;entrance&quot; onto an actual building entrance located nearby or the English word &quot;entrance&quot; in the game&#39;s description of the entrance.</p> <p>Release announcement trailer: <a href=\"h",

In traditional turn-based tactics games, units have a random percent chance to miss their attacks. What happens when you replace RNG with physics? You end up with a skill-based game where landing the shots is all up to YOU! Balance deep, well-formulated strategies and insane trick-shots to take out the enemies.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Over 100 synergistic items to master! Mix and match to build your most powerful loadout.</li> <li>16 campaign challenges that change up how you play each run.</li> <li>Unique map mechanics like moving conveyor belts and spinning obstacles to shoot through.</li> </ul> <p>The planned release date is this summer. Let me know what you think!</p> </di",

I&#39;m Erik aka Erkberg, a solo developer from Berlin.</p> <p>The Greenening is a so called &quot;active incremental&quot;, meaning there&#39;s a lot of &quot;numbers going up&quot; and many upgrades to be purchased, but only little idle time. Instead, you actively control a cloud that rains upon a forlorn world to wash away the thick layers of ash covering everything, discovering what&#39;s buried underneath.</p> <p>The game plays a bit like a mix between Nodebuster and Digseum*, but with an emphasis on exploration and a strong nature theme. There&#39;s also a cozy little space garden to grow and tend to.</p> <p>The Greenening is my second commercial game and this is my first Indie Sunday for it, so I&#39;m really excited to hear what you think!</p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p>Steam: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3441280/The_Greenening\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3441280/The_Greenening</a></p> <p>Trailer: <a hre",
