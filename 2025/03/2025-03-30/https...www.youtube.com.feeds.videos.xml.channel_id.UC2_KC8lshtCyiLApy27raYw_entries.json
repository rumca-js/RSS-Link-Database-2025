I think most people are at least fascinated by what some architectural firm comes up with when they\u2019re bored. But there\u2019s a reason most visionary skyscrapers remain visions, as opposed to real things. It\u2019s because they\u2019re kinda dumb. Sky City 1000 was the attempt to build an entire city, within a single building, inside another city. It\u2019s a bad idea, obviously, and it wasn\u2019t going to happen, but I think its worth looking back at what, at one point, wasn\u2019t seen as \u2018the worst idea ever\u2019.\n\nBordering on science fiction, while somehow appearing to be uniquely nostalgic, this is one of my favorite planned hyper tall skyscrapers, but also one I\u2019m glad was never and will never be constructed.",
