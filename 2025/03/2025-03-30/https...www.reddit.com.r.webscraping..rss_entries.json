Typically, I pick 4 or 8 threads for convenience, but for particularly large sites, I test different thread counts (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) to find the best performance.</p> <p>Ideally, I\u2019d like a way to dynamically optimize the number of threads while scraping. However, <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> doesn\u2019t support real-time adjustment of worker numbers. Something like:</p> <ol> <li>Start with one thread, scrape a few dozen pages, and measure pages per second.</li> <li>Increase the thread count (e.g., 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 8, etc.), measuring performance at each step.</li> <li>Stop increasing threads when the speed gain plateaus.</li> <li>If performance starts to drop (due to rate limiting, server load, etc.), reduce the thread count and re-test.</li> </ol> <p>Is there an existing Python package or example code that handles this kind of dynamic adjustm",
