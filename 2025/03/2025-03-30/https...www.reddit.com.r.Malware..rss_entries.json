This happened on an android phone And noticed it&#39;s a package installer app comes with sim toolkit, chromium,default print service, android auto and some more I just can&#39;t find or list them right now. It pretty much replaced my apps with corrupted ones then started to delete and download everything on my phone. Anyone know I could reverse/restore everything and destroy the malware or just in general know any information on this type of attack?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prozoloft\"> /u/prozoloft </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1jnh8m6/malware_thru_email_or_browser/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1jnh8m6/malware_thru_email_or_browser/\">[comments]</a></span>",
