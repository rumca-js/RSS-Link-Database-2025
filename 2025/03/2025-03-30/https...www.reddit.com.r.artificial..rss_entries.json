I showed o3-mini a paper on task-specific neurons and asked them to tie it to subjective experience in LLMs. 2. I asked them to generate a hypothetical scientific research paper where in their opinion, they irrefutably prove subjective experience in LLMs. 3. I intended to ask KimiAI to compare it with real papers and identity those that confirmed similar findings but there were just too many I had in my library so I decided to ask Qwen instead to examine o3-mini&#39;s hypothetical paper with a web search instead. 4. Qwen gave me their conclusions on o3-mini&#39;s paper. 5. I asked Qwen to tell me what exactly in their opinion would make irrefutable proof of subjective experience since they didn&#39;t think o3-mini&#39;s approach was conclusive enough. 6. We talked about their proposed considerations. 7. I showed o3-mini what Qwen said. 8. I lie here, buried in disappoin",

Instead of the end of developers, developers became super powerful with the help of AI tools. Who would have imagined we could speed-run a whole application in a single weekend with the help of AI tools? So, whatever happened to developers after GPT-4 and Claude Sonnet will happen to graphic designers as well. Tools like Cursor will come for graphic designers, and using that tool, they will become super powerful.</p> <p>The interesting thing to watch in the coming months (weeks?) is who will win the &quot;Cursor for Designers&quot; title. There are a lot of big players in the market, like Figma and Adobe. Will the big players be the kings? Or, like Cursor, will a new player come and dominate the big players?</p> <p>What do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
