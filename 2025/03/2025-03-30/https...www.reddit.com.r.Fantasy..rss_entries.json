I took inspiration from each book I read for the challenge for 25 separate manicures over the past year. That was a really fun way to interact with my nail polish in a new way and it was a great way keep me more engaged with the challenge. I plan on doing it again for the next one! Each book with the nail inspiration will be in a separate link next to the category. I&#39;m also leaving my star (moon since I can do a half moon) ratings for each entry if you&#39;re interested in that!</p> <p>A caveat - I am very much an amateur and honestly not that artistic. I use lacquer only (no gel) and a lot of the designs are made using stamps which makes them look more complicated than the actually are. I had a lot of fun with this and I thought others might enjoy seeing a little bit of a weird twist on the challenge. I&#39;m not trying to self promo",

In no particular order:</p> <p><strong>Inda</strong> by Sherwood Smith (First in a Series)</p> <p>Really great fantasy with a fascinating society and a sprawling cast of characters. I read this one at the very beginning of Bingo and it took me a week or two to get through, but honestly I\u2019d recommend that pace, which let me really sink into and absorb the world.</p> <p><strong>Going Postal</strong> by Terry Pratchett (Criminals)</p> <p>My second Pratchett ever, and after bouncing off the first a bit I was glad to like this one a whole lot! It could\u2019ve been a simple reinvention-of-something-we-have-in-the-real-world story like <em>Legends &amp; Lattes</em>, but all the extra bits of plot elevate it beyond that level.

The ones that pop in my head are Samantha Shannon, James Islington, Nicholas Eames and John Gwynne. And their series were published more than five years ago, in some cases more than ten.

Each of these books could almost go into a different subgenre of fantasy with how much they change between each of them, and that isn&#39;t a mark against them.

But I always read the blurb and flip through it first, and jumping in completely blind was a new experience for me. I went to the new shelf at the library and just picked out whatever appealed that had the fantasy sticker. I got a miss, then a sequel, before I stuck with one. It was just so strange to be 20 pages in and still have no clue what the premise is. I might do it more often.</p> <p>So anyway, here\u2019s what I read with the reviews!</p> <p>1st",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just finished reading some history books that dealt heavily with Phoenician, Greek and Roman colonies and their governance in the Ancient Mediterranean and beyond. Lots of amazing stuff and it made me wonder if there are any good fantasy series that dealt heavily with this. I\u2019ve read the Expanse which is arguably a good sci-fi analogue for this, but I\u2019m looking for more of a low-fantasy stand-in, and ideally inspired more by Antiquity rather than a Medieval or post-Medieval timeframe, but like I said: a good suggestion is a good suggestion and I\u2019ll likely take a look at most recommendations if the basis is there and the story is good!</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AustinioForza\"> /u/AustinioForza </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jn00r1/any_good_series_deal_heavily_with_the_founding/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://w",
