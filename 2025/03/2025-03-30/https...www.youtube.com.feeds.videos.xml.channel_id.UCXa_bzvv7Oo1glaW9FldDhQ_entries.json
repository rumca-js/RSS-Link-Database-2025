        "description": "Whilst it\u2019s true the now twelve-year-old PlayStation 4 misses out on many of the latest and greatest titles, there\u2019s still a wealth of games releasing on Sony\u2019s aging hardware that make owning the PS4 still a worthy endeavour. \n\nHopefully this rundown of fifteen big PS4 games coming in 2025 proves that, and with awe-striking platformers, modern re-imaginings of classic titles, brand-new AAA games, real-time tactical forbearers, and the latest Tony Hawk collection, there\u2019s plenty of variety on offer too. \n\nWhilst they might not all exhibit anywhere near the graphical fidelity of current-gen hardware, the gameplay in these games is inarguably on point. Sadly, the PS4 won\u2019t be a viable option for many more years, but these games prove that there\u2019s life in the old console yet.",
