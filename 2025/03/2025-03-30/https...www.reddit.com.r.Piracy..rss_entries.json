I found it on YouTube so I finished the full movie, no problem on that. But Today I wanted to watch Skin(2018) and the websites all showed only 21 minutes runtime while it is actually a nearly 2 hour movie. How do I solve this problem? Is it just with me?

However, I have nowhere near the level of experience in regards to avoiding switch bans as most people would on this sub, and thus, would like your expertise of whether this would work or not.
