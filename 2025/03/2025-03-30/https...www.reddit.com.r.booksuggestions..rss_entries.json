When he grew up, he joined the military, which seemed to enforce that thinking. </p> <p>Although he has lightened up since the grandkids came into being, he&#39;s still making it really hard for our kids, who are scared to feel any in strong emotions in his presence, because instead of understanding and empathy, he gets mad and stops talking to them. Sometimes he will just get up and leave. </p> <p>He&#39;s a big reader, and although I think giving him a book on the subject will elict a pissy response, I think he might secretly read it and hopefully, if the book works well enough, might just crack the egg enough to let some sunlight in on his stunted inner child. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WanderInTheTrees\"> /u/WanderInTheTrees </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksugges",

Or it can even be something entirely different where The subplot marches toward the main plot, where everything is built for the main story to progress, and in the end, the subplot either ends or continues along the world. </p",
