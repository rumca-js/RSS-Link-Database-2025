Options include:<br/> - Caution Level1: disable biometric lock and use password only on all devices and applications.<br/> - Caution Level 4: E2E protect all applications and password lock all access before reentry but stay connected to all systems; leave storage on device.<br/> - Caution level 5: Travel with normal devices but remove access to most cloud-backed-up data upon reentry. (inconvenient; prone to data loss)<br/> - Caution level 6: Set up secondary travel devices with highly limited data access: only enough for each client.<br/",
