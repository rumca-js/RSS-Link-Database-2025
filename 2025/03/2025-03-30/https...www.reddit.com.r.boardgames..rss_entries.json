You laid out tiles which I think may have been hexagons, to create a board. There were a certain number of tiles which were dungeons that characters can explore and try to complete. I think that there were certain key items you could collect that could make your chances of success in a dungeon better (like having a rope to climb out of a pit) but you could still attempt the dungeon anyway.</p> <p>Sorry if that&#39;s super vague.

I&#39;m excited to introduce my recently developed game called TacTicToe - an abstract strategy game that brings tic-tac-toe into the third dimension with some interesting twists.</p> <p>Before giving an overview, the game can be played online <a href=\"https://tactictoe.io/\">here</a> and we have a discord server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/zAtBSvzS4q\">here</a>. If it interests you the code is open source and can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/jimphowe/TacTicToe.io/\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Game Overview:</strong></p> <p>TacTicToe is played on a 3\u00d73\u00d73 grid with two players competing to place three of their pieces in a row in any orientation (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). What makes this game unique is that the board starts with 8 neutral pieces randomly placed, and players can either add new pieces to empty spaces OR push existing pieces around the board.</p> <p><strong>Key Mechanics:</strong></p> <p>Push mechanics: Pl",

That\u2019s when I discovered a local hobby store and met a playtester for the Call of Cthulhu CCG. As a fan of Lovecraft\u2019s writing, I was immediately intrigued, and since I had never played a card game like it before, I quickly fell down the rabbit hole. I even helped with playtesting for a while and made it to the semifinals at the first tournament held at Origins. Meeting Eric Lang in person was a great experience. I wish I had won\u2014the prize was designing a card that featured your likeness\u2014but regardless, I still think Call of Cthulhu CCG/LCG is one of his best designs. It\u2019s a shame the game is dead; in my opinion, it blows Magic: The Gathering away.

Looks like it&#39;s missing 4 destiny cards, 2 of each color. And about 15 scene cards. I haven&#39;t played it yet or even tried. 2 of the stories are still sealed. Is this unplayable with only 10 destiny cards instead of 14?

They are now winning the tie 4 wonders to 3. Game ends last player wins.</p> <p>It feels like 1st player, can take the advantage but can never win at the end of their turn. Last player CAN take the advantage and win before anyone else can do anything. Are we missing something or does last player getting to swoop in and take wonders and win immediately after a huge advantage to the last player?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ja",

It was a blast and the quality of most of the components is amazing. My only issue is with the bags. While playing, my wife and I noticed the inside of the bags had a lot of threads pulling out. Is this an issue others are having too? I just can&#39;t tell if ours is a mistake or if that&#39;s just the nature of the material used.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gabriels_Pies\"> /u/Gabriels_Pies </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jn0nkg/new_quacks_2025_reprint_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jn0nkg/new_quacks_2025_reprint_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",
