How High We Go in the Dark is an incredible interconnected story collection exploring the impact of a deadly pandemic across the passage of hundreds of years. I love how it explores the relationship between grief, memory, technology, and tradition, and its vision of a world transformed by death is fascinating. It looks at how technology can create closeness and distance with concepts ranging from relationships in VR games to death hotels and family members immortalized in robot dogs that gradually grow obsolete. Perhaps the most cathartic part of this read for me was its incisive exploration of pandemic under capitalism - essentially, the commodification of death and the terrible cost of that commodification (complete with grim little touches like \u201cfunerary bitcoin&quot;). </p> <p>I don\u2019t know if I can",

He\u2019s 18, so it makes sense he\u2019d be exploring his sexuality. As the series progresses, he matures, goes to school, and grows out of that phase. This is a slice-of-life sci-fi about a young man flying in space, dealing with life\u2019s ups and downs, including personal introspection. Yes, there\u2019s some sex in later books, but it\u2019s not the focus of the story\u2014just part of Ishmael\u2019s growth. If you stop reading over a few scenes, you\u2019re missing the bigger picture of his journey. Plus, most of the series takes place on a ship where there\u2019s no sex, so it\u2019s not a major theme.

I would like if the books get down into the nitty gritty of taking care of the animals such as grooming, what to do when one is sick or injured. Also defending their flocks from predators. Like the story of David before he defeated Goliath. The animals can be realistic or fantastical. I would like the books to have a vibe similar to the youtube videos of The Hoof GP, the upcoming video game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfivaREoutQ\">Herdling</a> and while I have not read these books, I think they still have a similar vibe: <em>The Beast Player</em> by Nahoko Uehashi and <em>All the Horses of Iceland</em> by Sarah Tolmie. Cozy fantasy is fine, but I very much preferred there is drama and stakes in the story. If you have a book that is not about shepherding but is still very much about the day to fay life of caring for animals, that is fine too. Other",

The only reason I&#39;m writing this is because mt best friend was really into the idea and it&#39;ll be a good gift for her as she has been really stressed due to her exams recently. The story has a focus on a character named Amara, which was always nonbinary (genderqueer) as soon as I came up with them. I really want to explore my own enby identity through them, but the issue is I only recently figured my gender out. While I know the feelings that would go into writing them, I lack the vocabulary that would be easy enough to figure out when writing gendered character. </p> <p>I do have a design for what they look like in mind (will probably draw them that&#39;ll surely help). I don&#39;t wanna push it obviously by making everything too on the nose (the story isn&#39;t about them being nb) but I do want it to be done right so if you can help and/or give me advice it&#39;ll be apricated.</",

I say this because if you look back on how Atticus was characterised, he didn&#39;t just act like a millennia. He acted like an online millennial.</p> <p>I only read up to Book 4 before I bailed but in that time, Atticus made references to things like - and correct me if I&#39;m wrong - Lolcats, leetspeak, going to Comicon and meeting Neil Gaiman (something that has definitely aged like milk) and other such references that were deeply rooted in online culture at the time of each book&#39;s release.</p> <p>Even reading about the books post Book 4 via others I suspect the influence on online culture was there.
