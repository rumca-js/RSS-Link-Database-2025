I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d smuggle it in for him?\u201d I did, of course, disguising it rather feebly by wrapping it in the dust jacket of the most boring book I owned: Lebanon, A&nbsp;Country in Transition. A customs official at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport flicked through it briefly, but even though the text was in Russian he didn\u2019t spot what it was about. Two nights later, near the entrance to Gorky Park, I handed over the book to a shifty character who seemed to be a supplier of forbidden goods to the dissident community. He gave me a small 18th-century icon in exchange for it.</p><p>It\u2019s only now, all these years later, that I\u2019ve realised I was almost cert",
