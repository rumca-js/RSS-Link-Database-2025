But in the case of the Pi 5, it is.\n\nWaveshare sent over the HAT I was using for testing in this video (but nothing else), and they send any other form of payment\u2014it was a project I had underway before they even sent the HAT. The video is NOT sponsored, and I in fact have purchased additional Waveshare M.2 E-Key HATs separate from this project... I just like to be *extremely* transparent about what equipment was provided in all my videos. So there ya go.\n\nSome of the things mentioned in this video (as an Amazon Associate, I earn for qualifying purchases):\n\n  - Waveshare PCIE to M.2 E-Key HAT+: https://amzn.to/3DBWybJ\n  - Waveshare PoE+ PCIE to M.2 E-Key HAT+: https://amzn.to/3Fio922\n  - Intel BE200 PCIe M.2 WiFi (Nicgiga): https://amzn.to/4hvaCBI\n  - Intel AX210 PCIe M.2 WiFi (Waveshare): https://amzn.to/4bHEzNz\n  - Netgear WiFi 7 WBE710 AP: https://amzn.to/4bK6rkd\n  - MokerLink Managed 10/2.5 GbE PoE+ Switch: https://amzn.to/3FoBmGU\n\nNote: ",
