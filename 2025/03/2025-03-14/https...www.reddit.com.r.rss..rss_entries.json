Currently my rss solution is Miniflux + Miniflutt, switching between web and mobile devices works like a charm, without syncing and local storing.</p> <p>However I just found Freshrss with an amazing web theme, especially its three columns layout. I&#39;d like to try it, but after some research, seems clients are all offline reading. I always carry 2 or 3 mobile on me, when the client&#39;s read status is marked as read and not sync in time, I can still find read articles on other mobiles.</p> <p>So is there any other rss clients support online reading teature, rather than Miniflutt?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CrazyShipTed\"> /u/CrazyShipTed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1jb8xfh/online_reading_client_on_android/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
