By examining both compile-time and run-time implications, attendees will gain valuable insights into how these abstractions impact system resources like memory usage and execution speed. \n\nKey areas of exploration will include: \n\n- Encapsulation: Assessing the cost of data hiding and interface protection depending on implementation strategies. \n- Inheritance: Evaluating the costs and benefits of using class hierarchies in environments where memory and processing power are limited. \n- Polymorphism: Comparing run-time polymorphism via virtual functions to compile-time alternatives like templates and concepts, analyzing their respective impacts on performance and flexibility. \n\nThrough empirical data and performance metrics",
