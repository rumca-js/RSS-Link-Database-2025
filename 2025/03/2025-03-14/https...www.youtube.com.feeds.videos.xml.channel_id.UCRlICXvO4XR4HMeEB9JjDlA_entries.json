        "description": "In the early 1900s, Battle Creek Sanitarium was the go-to health retreat for America\u2019s wealthy, run by the eccentric Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. He invented Cornflakes, not for breakfast convenience, but as part of his broader health mission.\n\nHis obsession with wellness led to bizarre treatments, including chewing food 40 times per bite and yogurt-based treatments. He also created a vibrating chair and slapping machine, all in the name of improving health.\n\nMeanwhile, his brother William accidentally created the first flaked cereal, and after years of mistreatment, struck out on his own, building the Kellogg\u2019s brand into a success. John\u2019s sanitarium, however, sank into debt and closed during the Great Depression. The brothers fought bitterly, but in the end, their cereal changed the breakfast world forever\u2014though not without a good dose of madness.",
