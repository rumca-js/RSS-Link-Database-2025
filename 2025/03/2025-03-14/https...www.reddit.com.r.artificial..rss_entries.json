It claimed to be a wholesome store selling handcrafted jewellery at a discount price (for a &quot;closing sale&quot;), but after looking at reviews, it turned out that the jewellery was very low-quality. What maddens me is that there are people that fall for this every day, and they have no idea until the product arrives. AI absolutely has good uses in some areas, but whoever decided to make this online scam is horrible and we should never support this kind of thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Boonerquad2\"> /u/Boonerquad2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1jau267/ai_scams_are_horrible/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1jau267/ai_scams_are_horrible/\">[comments]<",

This leads me to a question I\u2019ve been pondering:</p> <p>If AI continues advancing toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), and if these systems could conduct near-perfect ethical and moral evaluations, could we see the emergence of an AI-assisted governing system\u2014or even a fully AI-controlled government?

An AI-led government would be devoid of bias, emotion, and unethical dealings.</p> <p>I realize this might sound far-fetched, even borderline psychotic, but it\u2019s just a thought experiment.
