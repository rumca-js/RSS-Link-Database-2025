Everything depicted in terms of a job in this film has happened to me, the traffic in the morning, the annoying co workers, the passive aggressive boss who you can clearly tell is trying to be sarcastic and piss you off, the annoying soul sucking phrases (\u201csounds like a case of the Monday\u2019s\u201d) and if you screw up, you have 3 different people telling you the same shit within the span of 10 minutes and you have to just suck it up and take it, unfortunately as long as these jobs exist, this film will remain timeless. The second half of this film is just as great at the first because it shows all the things that YOU WANT to do but can\u2019t because you\u2019ll get fired, Mike Judge really nailed the realism of jobs, and it\u2019s one of my all time favorite comedies, however it can also be called a documentary\ud83d\ude02</p> </div>",

I\u2019m assuming a very common process esp in dialogue scenes are POV scenes that cut back and forth between two actors maybe with a stand in doing the \u201cover the shoulder\u201d shot. With actors always having busy conflicting schedules it must be cheaper and easier for each actor to shoot their portion of dialogue with someone off screen feeding them the reciprocating lines.

Something that\u2019s funny, or wholesome, etc. Preferably nothing involving dogs, because I really can\u2019t handle anything to do with them right now. It\u2019ll just remind me of my pup.
