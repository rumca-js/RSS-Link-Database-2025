The mics I&#39;m using are ICS-52000 with following datasheet:</p> <p><a href=\"https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DS-000121-ICS-52000-v1.3.pdf\">https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DS-000121-ICS-52000-v1.3.pdf</a></p> <p>The main issue I see is that the standard I\u00b2S protocol only has a frame length of 64 bits, where I would need 128 and of course reading 4 streams instead of 2.

Live Stream Video to the App \u2013 The app (built with Flutter) should also display a real-time video feed from the camera. </code></pre> <p>Has anyone implemented something similar?
