What happens if we move 2 positions ? Is there a collision or is position 2 skipped and we arrive safely at position 3 without having to remove the plane on 2 ? Collision made more sense. - in our first game, we completed all the checkmarks to rule out a win, but i had one dice left and all coffees were prepared. I assume the last dice doesnt matter ? But its said we stop after we placed down all dices.
