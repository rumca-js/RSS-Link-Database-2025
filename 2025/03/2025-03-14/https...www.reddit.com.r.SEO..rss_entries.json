Anything you guys came across? I just feel as search behaviour shifts more towards AI engines it will be more and more important to figure out howto get the ChatGPT SEO work</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have some app on the play store. I planned to build a site similar to what App is. Basically web version of App. I was getting good traction and indexing initially for my site. I realised my App&#39;s domain listed on play store was just some blogger page. So I replaced it with my site url. In 24hr or so my impressions dropped. I quickly removed it then impression stayed stable but not increasing now like before. After few days i thought Google play store link has nothing to do with this so I updated link again. In 24 hrs my site completely disappeared even if I search with exact domain nothing comes up.</p> <p>Do you think it could be due to Google Play Store backlink? I am bit worried to set my domain on app page now</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prasadkirpekar\"> /u/prasadkirpekar </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1jatdpp/site_disappeared_from_google_after_back",
