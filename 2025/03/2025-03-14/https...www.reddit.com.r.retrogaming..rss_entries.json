I suppose what I am trying to get at is that with the state that video game graphics had gotten to at that time is that I do wonder how such a game was so controversial to begin with anyway because like I said before, graphics in gaming back weren\u2019t very advanced looking as characters resembled stick figures on the Atari\u2019s hardware, so I wonder how something ",

I owned a PS1 and PS2 but for some reason in my mind, those don&#39;t impress me as much. The Xbox 360 was great and the modern Xbox is one of my favorite consoles and is the one I&#39;ve spent the most hours gaming on. I owned a GBA as a kid but only had 2 games for it, so it was not something I cared for. </p> <p>As I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve spent less time on my Xbox because of how convoluted games feel. Maybe it&#39;s not the games fault on their own. Maybe it&#39;s a mix of social media, my age, and the business side of the industry that removed the simplicity of gaming for me. Gaming tends to feel like a job nowadays: get the game and spend hours researching meta&#39;s, or how to setup your characters, or how to be efficient because these games are 100&#39;s of hours long etc.) plus a new one drops every day it seems and sli",

I had dismissed SMB2 as a kid because of its history, but on its own terms it&#39;s a great game that does everything a great sequel should.<br/> So, naturally, I wanted to play through the GBA version of the game, and played long enough to make it to world 2, and stopped. The colors were too bright, it was too easy (hearts everywhere) and the voice lines annoyed me. Then I thought about its release period, console, and target audience.<br/> As someone who was born in the late 80s and grew up in the 90s, I would have been a teenager when the GBA came out.

You were playing a red character jumping through different level. I remember the first level as an grass area with spiders an bees and you wer able to throw a knife after them. We loved playing that game. Unfortunately I couldn\u2018t find anything about that game. Maybe someone here has an idea.. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SummerJam__\"> /u/SummerJam__ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jaueli/searching_a_game_called_mad/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jaueli/searching_a_game_called_mad/\">[comments]</a></span>",
