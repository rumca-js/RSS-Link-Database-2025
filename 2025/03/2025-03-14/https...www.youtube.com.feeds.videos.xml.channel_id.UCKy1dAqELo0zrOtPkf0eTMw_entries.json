The update will be available March 20th for PlayStation and PC, while real-life events and merch will be available starting March 15th. In other news, the Knights of the Old Republic remake at Saber Interactive is apparently still alive and kicking, despite the devs not having shown anything from the game outside of the announcement teaser three years ago. We'll believe it when we see it, Saber. And finally, Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A has been rated E10+, a technically more mature rating than the usual E for Everyone rating Pok\u00e9mon games usually get. What does that mean for content? More swearing? Excessive violence? Who knows!",
