I wrote a <strong>2-page Google Doc</strong> with every detail: exact script timestamps, hex codes for branding, even reference videos for tone.</p> <p>The guy had 5-star reviews, flawless English on Zoom, and promised he \u201ctotally got it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> He didn\u2019t.</p> <p>First draft: He used some Serif font for text overlays. My doc literally said \u201cUse Futura, size 24px.\u201d I asked for revisions, pointing to the spec. He apologized; said it was a \u201cfile mix-up.\u201d I also pointed out the colors were wrong with the brand colors and hoped he would get it right.</p> <p>Second draft: Colors were #FF0000 red instead of our brand\u2019s #CC0000. Even after making it explicit in the first round of revisions. I sent him a link of the spec. <",
