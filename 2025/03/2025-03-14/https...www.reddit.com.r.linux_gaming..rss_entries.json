So an RTX 5090 and a GTX 980 for example.</p> <p>I was wondering, would a setup like this work on Linux with NVIDIA proprietary drivers? If so, how?</p> <p>Or perhaps the drivers would need to be the same one, and support the same GPUs, something like a 5090 and RTX 3050, instead of an older legacy card like 980? Since they would both be using the same driver version instead of two drivers for each GPU. (Something I&#39;m ",
