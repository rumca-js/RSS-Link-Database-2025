It&#39;s ported from console, for context, Dokapon Kingdom: Connect.</p> <p>When I run it on the computer without the headset, it runs fine. But using my headset and virtual desktop, it constantly flashes. It will get stuck on certain frames, like the king sitting on his throne, and keep flashing to that frame in between new frames. It&#39;s very disorienting but I can&#39;t figure out where the process is breaking down.</p> <p>I went into VD settings and changed fps, but that doesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My quest 2 has been dying slowly for the past year now. I only use it for PCVR but I have a lot of stick drift, it&#39;s uncomfy, the oculus PC link is so slow, etc. In April, I&#39;m going to china for a study trip, and I was wondering if the Pico 4 was still good, or if there was another headset of around the same price that&#39;s better. Keep in mind 2 things:<br/> 1: I will use it pretty much exclusively for PCVR with a CABLE (my internet is too slow for virtual desktop), so I don&#39;t really care about the specs besides maybe resolution and refresh rate, but I&#39;d rather have comfort.</p> <p>2: I live in the third world, so I can&#39;t buy a headset at like walmart or anything. This is one of my only chances to buy a headset at retail price, next time could be in like 2 or 3 years. If you recommend another headset, it needs to be of around the same price and available in china.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

Seeing people being able to do 500 (which I then realized is Quest 3 only) and 400mbps while I&#39;m over here struggling reaching even 200. Was using 150mbps HEVC 10bit to get more stable experience (not perfect still) but was still wondering what the hell am I to do to reach higher bitrate. What sort of routers are people using.</p> <p>So first I bought new router, one of the budget one suggested on the discord, since I was on Huawei which are not recommended at all. But when testing it out? There was absolutely no change from my Huawei. So I sent it back. Was then seeing people being very happy with 6e routers which are pricey but more than that, 6ghz WiFi is only supported by Quest 3. Also I live in village and am literally only person making 5ghz WiFi, so there should be zero interference. From what I read biggest thing with 6ghz on Quest 3 is that you will most likely be only one using that channel unlike 5gh",

Obviously comparing integrated with dedicated graphics is scuffed, but I&#39;m guessing since it runs genshin it should run this too. Tho idk how VR works so any tips are appreciated.</p> <p>Upgrade is planned to a medion erazer major x20 2024, but it&#39;s still to be determined when XD so something that runs on the current one would be ideal.</p> <p>Under 300 euros would be best, the cheaper the better.
