So I was wondering if there is a way to use another laptop as an extra monitor, the thing is that I bought another monitor but my dock isn&#39;t compatible with the usbc-c so I can only use my only hdmi port lol but I already have another monitor connected to it... so I came up with the idea that perhaps i could connect my new monitor with a old laptop that i can share my workspace with (from the one that i use) so when connecting the old lap to hdmi it&#39;ll be like i have two monitors, the one that i have in the computer i use, the one i have connected to my current laptop hdmi and the other that&#39;s connected to the old laptop in some way? I&#39;ve come across some with virual vm, but that&#39;s not the idea I have in mind, so if anyone knows I can look into it :^) ty!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EthanVitale\"> /u/EthanVitale </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/c",
