They don&#39;t live in state, but visit (and stay in our house) for weeks as a time, and while they&#39;re around, I am VERY overwhelmed by their behavior. They constantly want to hold my daughter and take her into different rooms without me, and I generally feel very out of control when they&#39;re around. It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t listen to me, but they simply don&#39;t ever ask me anything about how I want things handled with my daughter. I want my daughter to have a good relationship with them, they love her so much, and would like to find the tools to navigate this new phase of our relationship.

I\u2019ve read two books in the past few months that really struck my interest and I really enjoyed them, but any other books I\u2019ve picked up I have not been able to get past a few chapters. I read and finished Dubliners by James Joyce and Stoner by John Williams. I\u2019m not sure in the literary context if those two books have much in common\u2014 but they gave me the same feeling and it\u2019s something I\u2019m looking for in my next few reads. For context I\u2019m a 19 year old college student with a major dopamine addiction\u2014 which makes it hard for me to focus on reading. I did not have that issue with Dubliners or Stoner.

Dweck, Do epic sh*t, get epic sh*t done etc. </p> <p>For all this time I have used youtube and google searches as my source of book suggestion, while scrolling I got to know the concept of Ubermensch ( Super man ) by Fredrick Nietzsche, it caught my attention and interest and so I tried to read &#39;Thus spoke Zarathustra&#39; but the book felt very confusing to me, I discussed it to one of my friend and he told me that I must start with some basic philosophy books before going to &#39;Thus spoke Zarathustra&#39;. </p> <p>I absolutely want to dive deeper into Philosophy but don&#39;t know where to start, please suggest me some simple starter books for philosophy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

When I was really into reading and younger, I liked, Maze runner, Percy Jackson, Eigth grade bites, battle royale, hunger games, etc. I want something with adult characters, not too derivative of lord of the rings (neverwhere) or harry potter.
