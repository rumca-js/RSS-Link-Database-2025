        "description": "What's the cost for having a great name? Batman bin Suparman knows all too well.\n\n\n\"Indonesian names and naming customs reflect the multicultural and multilingual nature of the over 17,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago. The world's fourth most populous country, Indonesia is home to numerous ethnic groups, each with their own culture, custom, and language.\nThe naming customs by no means are consistent, and may differ by ethnic group. For example, most western Indonesians do not have surnames (exceptions: Bataks, Nias, Mentawai, Enggano, and some Dayaks), while eastern Indonesians do generally have it (exceptions: Balinese, West Nusa Tenggara people, and some ethnic groups in Sulawesi).\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/q",
