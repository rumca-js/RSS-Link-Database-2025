Last year I got into the idea of self hosting, so I got myself an old PC from office (i5 7th gen or so, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and a 4TB USB-HDD). I was mostly happy with it so I decided to upgrade a bit. I got myself some new hardware: B660 Plus D4, i3 12100, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 3x 4TB HDD and 2x 256GB SSD. The ASUS mainboard had the benefit of 2.5gbps-LAN, so no bottleneck if my gf and I needed to use it both at the same time while our PCs are connected with 1gbps each. Fine. Or so I thought. </p> <p>Since I moved to the new hardware, when using my smb-share I only got 11MB/s. Found out, that\u2019s some 100mbps. So not the 1gbps my router can do over lan. That\u2019s not what I got the SSD drives for, that have been allocated as Cache-drive in UnRAID. After spending the whole evening looking for the problem and with help of a friend, I ruled out a malfunction of the new HDD-drives (I tried UnRAID and TrueNAS, same problems) and I tried ",

I\u2019m looking for recommendations for open-source tools or platforms (preferably open-source) to help me build a simple chatbot. I want to connect it to Messenger, Instagram, and possibly Telegram. Ideally, I\u2019d love something self-hosted, similar to ManyChat, but with the flexibility to run on my own server.</p> <p>The bot I have in mind is super straightforward\u2014no AI or fancy stuff, just buttons and predefined options for users to choose from. I\u2019ve come across n8n and it looks promising, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the right fit for what I need.</p> <p>Any suggestions or experiences you\u2019d like to share?

In short, DB Backup is a container that do a database dump automatically. It has been designed to be a part of a compose stack and to be triggered by an integrated cron. The container also handle restoring the database directly by taking the last available backup on the directory or a specific one. It support Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB and InfluxDB.</p> <p>I recently added some features to allows for some customization such as custom scripts to run pre/post backup/restore jobs and also support for simple GET webhooks (my typical use case was to call an uptime kuma push url that will alert me if the url is not called at least every day).</p> <p>Here is the repository url for those interested: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jdfranel/db-backup\">https://gitlab.com/jdfranel/db-backup</a> </p> <p>Hope this helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",
