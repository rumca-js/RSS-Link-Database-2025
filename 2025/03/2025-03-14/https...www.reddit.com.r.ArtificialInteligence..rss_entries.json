If I were to google information about it, Austria wouldn&#39;t be mentioned anywhere. </p> <p>I asked if it had the info from my IP adress and it said it doesn&#39;t have access to my IP. </p> <p>Does anyone have an explaination? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LenasVision\"> /u/LenasVision </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jarkha\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligenc",
