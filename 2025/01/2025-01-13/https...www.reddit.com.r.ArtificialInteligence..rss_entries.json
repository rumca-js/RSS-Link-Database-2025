I really think ML engineers should not waste time rewriting the same code over and over to develop different (but similar) models. Once you reframe the business problem as an ML solution, you should be able to establish a meaningful experiment design, generate relevant features, and fully automate the model development following basic optimization principles.</p> </blockquote> <p>YES!</p> <p>Antoher way to do this is to have a library of functionality that you can call in business appropriate situations.
