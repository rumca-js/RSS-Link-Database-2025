        "description": "Dynasty Warriors: Origins reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\nIf Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it\u2019s off to a masterful start. It doesn\u2019t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content \u2013 all while looking better than\u00a0ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast make this story sing. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark.\n\n#DynastyWarriorsOrigins #Gaming #IGN",
