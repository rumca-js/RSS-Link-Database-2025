Welcome discussions/critique/etc on the project. Link below to the GitHub project and the YouTube video of the talk. A white paper (that needs some corrections) is also available on the GitHub.</p> <p>Overall the talk is about the process of building a covert channel and the importance of being critical of one&#39;s own work. Hope you all enjoy!</p> <p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-_jUZBMeU5w?t=20857&amp;si=qJZSSWWVdLd-3zVM\">https://youtu.be/-_jUZBMeU5w?t=20857&amp;si=qJZSSWWVdLd-3zVM</a></p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/nuvious/QuiCC\">https://github.com/nuvious/Qui",

The goal of the executable is to simply kills the game every minute or two.</p> <p>Since we are both developers, hiding the file is not so easy. First time I did this by simply adding file to startup, that was way too simple. Second time I created an service/ timer job and named it GoogleServices. That one was very effective and he did not find it until I told him where it is. </p> <p>Now&#39;s the time of the year again to help my friend drop this game, so my question is how could I hide the executable so he would not find it easily? For now I am thinking of Startup registry key, maybe leveraging environment variables somehow. Obviously anything that shows in task manager is going to be instantly f",
