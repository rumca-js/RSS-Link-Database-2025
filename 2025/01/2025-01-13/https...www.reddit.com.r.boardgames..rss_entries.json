I actually think the factory inserts are pretty good, but with Carnival of Chaos it does require the box extender and so a big box already takes up more room... so, to Folded Space or not?

I saw on <a href=\"/r/boardgamedeals\">/r/boardgamedeals</a> that Yokohama was on sale and was considering that game as well. Is it too similar to The White Castle? I also have Iki on my wish list. I wouldn&#39;t be purchasing it now, but how does that compare to The White Castle or Yokohama? Basically, I&#39;m debating which one is the best out of three to buy. If I am understanding correctly, they are all worker placement? Are they different enough to eventually own all three, or are they too similar? Thanks for any thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sugarplumcow\"> /u/sugarplumcow </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i03ve6/japanthemed_worker_placement_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i03ve6/japanthemed_worker_plac",

But the main premise is everyone is working together to escape a dark forest but one person is secretly working for the evil thing that is trying to kill the players before they leave. They are basically trying to lead the other players to the monster while the players try to escape. </p> <p>I believe i also remember there being footprint pieces that you placed on the board to show the path of the players i think??</p> <p>Sorry if this isnt much, ive been thinking about this game for years and really wanna know what it is called.

They have a series of rectangles/squares of various sizes and colors on them. Some cards have only one or two rectangles/squares, others had 5+ rectangles/squares on them. You would stack cards based on the position of a specific colored rectangle/square relative to the position (numbered from the inside to the outside of the card\u2019s center) of that same color on the previous card.
