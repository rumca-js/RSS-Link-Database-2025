AI is not just a tool for the future, it is already reshaping our lives in profound ways.\u201d No kidding. That\u2019s just a couple of sentences out of an entire speech written by ChatGPT when it was asked to come up with one on AI in the style of Keir Starmer.</p><p>Much of it wasn\u2019t a million miles away.

Panicked, Thomas shoves her body into a chest \u2013 then his wife comes home early. It\u2019s not a bad setup, but it\u2019s almost impossible to work out what The Girl in the Pool is meant to be. Is it a comedy about middle-aged male stupidity, or a naff throwback to 80s thrillers that gave beautiful, emotionally unstable homewreckers what was coming to them?</p><p>Providing the movie with its comic undertone is a funny (intentionally, I think) performance from Prinze Jr as dim-bulb Thomas.

With new coach Matt Daly, Gauff has ironed out much of the issues with her forehand and serve and is playing a brand of highly confident tennis. Further, the fact that Gauff is one of the fastest players on tour and possesses a very strong mindset makes her somewhat upset-proof in the bigger events.</p> <a href=\"https:/",
