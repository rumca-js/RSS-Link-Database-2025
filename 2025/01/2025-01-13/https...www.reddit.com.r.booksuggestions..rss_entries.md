Castlevania got me interested in this genre and I’ve since read a few of the vampire hunter d books and the Witcher. I especially liked the vampires in the Witcher like Regis because he’s such an interesting layered character. I’m kinda turned off by romance in these books, so the less the better.

She likes nature and animals. She is very loving and emotional. She likes learning. She likes traveling. She loves other mediums of art too such as journaling/blogging/writing for her website or instagram, and wants me to find a creative outlet myself. But she likes all forms of art and is always open and excited to try new things like that. She is older, in her 60s. It makes me sad to think she won’t always be around. She was raised catholic, and attends a nondenominational Christian church. I want something that will make her happy. She is a beautiful person inside and out. She is a very likable person and easy to be around🩷🥰She has anxiety I think and perhaps other mental health problems, she sees a therapist monthly. And she does physical therapy sometimes.

However, I couldn&#39;t get the stories out of my head (especially the one about the guy in a cabin in the winter). In a way, the book was about people&#39;s relationship to the mountain where they lived/stayed (ecopsychology).
