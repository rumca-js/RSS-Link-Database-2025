Although it does not mention the nation by name, it&#39;s broadly viewed as a means to prevent China from outpacing the US in AI development.</p>
<p>The rule proposes three licensing tiers. The first tier is unrestricted and includes the domestic market as well as 18 strategic allies. The majority of countries fall into a second tier, which will have caps on how much compute power they can import via top GPUs from the US. The third tier includes China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, and effectively bars US companies from selling their most powerful GPUs there.</p>
