I don&#39;t think it was super popular. </p> <p>What I remember, there were 4 main characters:</p> <p>Woman who was connected to the fire element (I remember she had a sword no one else could touch as it was connected to the fire element as well)</p> <p>Her love interest was wielding water element, he acctually appeared a bit later in the book</p> <p>First she met 2 other characters: one that was horribly scarred and could wield blood magic (maybe air as well??) and a one having earth magic abilities. </p> <p>As far as I remember they activated their elements by travelling through the axis of the earth (or it made it way stronger).

Besides the stupid romance that ruined the series for me, I just didn&#39;t like how the whole heist thing became an afterthought and it all became political intrigue.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Nekropolis</strong> by <em>Tim Waggoner</em> is a fun, funny dark romp. It’s very similar to Simon Green’s Nightside series, but certainly unique enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. The MC is a ex-detective from the regular world who followed a case into Nekropolis and ended up becoming a zombie there. He continues to fill a similar role in his new existence and takes on a case helping the half-breed Vampire child of a powerful Darklord. It’s action packed, the characters are fun, and there’s creativity on every page. </p> <p>I’ve been having a tough time finishing books the last few weeks, but this one kept thoroughly engaged throughout. Happened upon the title by accident, so thought I should give it a rec so others might find it too. </p> <p>This book lands squarely in one of my favorite niches, and that’s the niche that blends horror and fantasy.

I am a 21 year old male and have recently finished reading all of the Lord of the Rings and LOVED it! The journey, the characters, and the lessons taken away from those books are amazing. That is my first and only big series I have read though. I’ve heard about Brandon Sanderson and how Mistborn could be a good place to start for Adult Fantasy reading, but I also don’t want to neglect other fantasy works like Harry Potter. I’m just worried if i’m too old for a series like that or because i’ve already seen the movies (which is different than LOTR cause I watched the movies after reading) that I wouldn’t still get excitement or joy from that series. Any help with working through dilemmas like this would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BraeLightning13"> /u/BraeLightning13 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https

## What two series (or standalones) are very different from each other, but complement each other when read back to back?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Kind of a hard prompt I guess, but I remember reading The Dispossessed by Ursula LeGuin pretty soon after finishing God Emperor of Dune. It felt like whatever cynicism the Dune series had on people as a whole, The Dispossessed had a similar amount of optimism about people&#39;s ability to self-govern and self-regulate. I&#39;d say they were good back-to-back reads, and made me appreciate both stories more. </p> <p>Similarly I&#39;d say Alex Verus series and The Rivers of London series make good companion series, because both are urban fantasies set in the UK, but are otherwise as different from each other as possible. Alex Verus is maximally plot based while The Rivers of London is maximally character and setting based. The richness with which Rivers of London series dwells on London history/culture/architecture/ethnography feels very fulfilling, and I also really liked how it depicted multiculturalism in a big city as an immigrant, felt true to my o

Which may not sound like much but I’ve read over two hundred of them since I started writing in the genre myself. It’s a small genre compared to fantasy and science-fiction but that doesn’t mean there’s not a lot of people who enjoy writing prose stories of caped crusaders.</p> <p>I think this may actually qualify as the first “cozy” superhero novel that I’ve ever read as well even though there is a decent plot. The stakes are real with a bunch of people being kidnapped around a city but it is restricted to the fairly small community of Bailey City as well as more interested in establishing the lives of the characters versus their ability to punch bad guys. It’s one of the novels that I would say is read

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For most of my time reading this book, I had mixed feelings. But that explosive and emotional ending has me shook to the core and I&#39;m sitting here quaking. </p> <p>Let&#39;s start with the audiobook. The narrator did a great job, especially with Harrow&#39;s voice. But in my opinion the names make this book a bad experience on audio. There was no way I could keep up with complicated, unusual names that also had pseudonyms based on which house they were from. Not to mention I feel like the story never spoonfeeds you the information but instead asks you to derive it from context (a good thing). </p> <p>I gave up listening shortly after the point where Griddle and Harrow reach Canaan House.</p> <p>Since I still enjoyed the themes, I picked up the hardcovers. Still found the part after they reached Canaan House to be confusing, though seeing the names in print and having the house guide at the front made it much easier.</p> <p>Then I feel like the pl
