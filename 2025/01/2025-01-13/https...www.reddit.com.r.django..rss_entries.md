<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>A few questions:</p> <ol> <li>I&#39;m about to launch a product in the next few months. I&#39;m a blind developer, and want to make sure that my UI looks okay. Is there an easy way to give my django templates to someone I pay to make them look better without sharing the entire repo of code? I&#39;m under a couple license restrictions and don&#39;t know how to handle that.</li> </ol> <p>Finally, Are there reasonable t&amp;c/ToS templates that are useful for copying without paying a lawyer $250/h? Anything else I should be concerned about in that realm when launching? Any pitfalls you ran into when launching a service?</p> <p>Thanks,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sorressean"> /u/sorressean </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1i0qqlq/questions_about_launching_first_publicfacing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p>I’m short on time and have already wasted some. I can’t figure out how to structure my <em>models and views</em>. It’s not that I don’t know how to code them, but I’m struggling with how I should design them.</p> <p>In my app, there will be <strong>Projects</strong>. Each project will have its own set of questions. It would be great if I could group the questions. For example, if there are 5 questions about &quot;Demographics,&quot; 5 questions about &quot;Quality,&quot; and 3 about &quot;Service,&quot; etc., it would be better if they were grouped. This way, if I want to move them up or down in order, I wouldn’t need to reorder each individual question. Changing the order of a group would be enough (to be honest, this is one of the main points that’s driving me crazy).</p> <p>Every project will have <strong>Locations</strong> where the surveys will be conducted. Each project’s questions will be applied to every location.</p> <p>T

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m working on a project to build a centralized system for managing orders from clients across multiple websites (around 10) and handling the coordination of tutors. The idea is to create a robust backend that integrates seamlessly with these external websites, allowing orders to flow into a central dashboard. Here&#39;s an outline of what the system needs to handle:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Order Management</strong>: <ul> <li>Orders from different websites need to be categorized and assigned to available tutors based on their expertise.</li> <li>Orders can go through various statuses: new, in progress, under revision, completed, etc.</li> <li>Tutors may need to submit drafts and final versions of their work, categorized properly.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Tutor Management</strong>: <ul> <li>Tutors should have their dashboards where they can view and claim orders, submit work, and manage their profiles.</li> <li>Admins should be
