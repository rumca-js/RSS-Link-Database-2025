Ben discusses Governor Gavin Newsom trying to reverse course on almost everything and pretending to be a moderate Republican. He issued a statement that he will cut through the red tape regarding people rebuilding their homes, there will be zero tolerance for looting during wildfires, and they will reimagine how the state of California works.
