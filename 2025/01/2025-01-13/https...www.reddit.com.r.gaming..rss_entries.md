<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My brother and I live in different countries. Gaming has been one way for us to keep in touch; we used to play games like Raft, Valheim, Astroneer, and Core Keeper. But now we are both young fathers without much time to play. (We&#39;re talking about setting aside one night a month, lol.) As a result, we don&#39;t think survival/crafting games would be much fun for us, since those require a certain amount of time to grind, by nature of the genre. What types of games could we play that are still fun even if it&#39;s only for a couple hours once a month?
