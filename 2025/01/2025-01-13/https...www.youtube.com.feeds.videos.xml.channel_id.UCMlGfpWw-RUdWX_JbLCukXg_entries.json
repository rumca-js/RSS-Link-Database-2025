It\u2019s been a long and difficult road, but we now have a proposal (P2900, \u201cContracts for C++\u201d) to add significant contract support in, we hope, C++26, with more complete support to follow in C++29.\n\nLooking back, the contracts feature has been unusually difficult and contentious. I contend that the difficulty is inherent in the feature: a contracts facility, by its nature,  cannot be understood from any single point of view.\n\nIn this lecture, I will explain why understanding contracts requires seeing the feature from a panoply of perspectives, and show how shifting between these perspectives allows one to make effective use of the facility.\n\nThis lecture is derived from presentations m",
