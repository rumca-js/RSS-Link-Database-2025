        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Doing research for a project. I would really like some books that detail the lives of working actors, specifically the day-to-day semantics of their jobs, even if it&#39;s only a few chapters of the book (I know these autobiographies usually start with their childhoods, anyway). Anecdotes about being on set, exchanges they&#39;ve had with their management team, etc. That&#39;s what I&#39;m interested in.</p> <p>Ideally an autobiography. Wouldn&#39;t mind fiction, though. Or even some... actor&#39;s guide book, I guess. I&#39;ve been picking through a lot of autobios so far but the one I&#39;ve found most helpful has been Corey Feldman&#39;s <em>Coreyography</em>. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/omatose\"> /u/omatose </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i0dpnt/books_about_the_daily_lives_of_working_actors/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a ",

I have no social life as I\u2019m afraid to meet and interact with people and open myself up because I\u2019ve been hurt in the past (TBC, I\u2019m fine being in public. It\u2019s actually opening myself up to people that\u2019s the problem). The only thing that makes life bearable most of the time is weed, but I don\u2019t use it every day because I don\u2019t want to become too dependent on it (but I do use it at least weekly). And, even though I am employed and have health insurance through work, it\u2019s been hard finding a therapist in my area since a lot of them are virtual but I prefer in-person (and a lot of them are a bit pricy for my budget, even with insurance). </p> <p>Nevertheless, I\u2019m wondering if there are any books (self-help, non-fiction, fiction, or maybe a mix of all these) like I\u2019ve described above that, while they won\u2019t be a cure-all, they do at least open my eyes to things I hadn\u2019t thought about before, and that",

Recently I started to read as a new year brings new opportunities. I am currently 2/3 of the way through the book The In-Between by Hadley Vlahos and have found that reading is fun to me. Maybe it is the book it is wonderful might review if wanted but I just bought Jennette McCurdy\u2019s book to read next because I\u2019ve heard great things about it. My question is what books should I add to my list. Obviously I\u2019m not a heavy reader but I would love to say my options based on the books I have read if anybody has a suggestion please let me hear it in the comments.

She loves other mediums of art too such as journaling/blogging/writing for her website or instagram, and wants me to find a creative outlet myself.

I&#39;m hoping for more of a lighter tone and writing style if possible; she does so much dense reading working on her master&#39;s degree in literature, and I know she sometimes finds an easier read refreshing.

My favorite thing about his books is how they&#39;re at the perfect mark between realistic enough to be plausible and fictional enough for me to escape into. The dry humor works really well and his prose is beautiful, I&#39;ve come away from both books with so many quotes that really struck me.
