<p>The Mastodon Team blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply, we are going to transfer ownership of key Mastodon
ecosystem and platform components (including name and copyrights,
among other assets) to a new non-profit organization, affirming
the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or controlled by a
single individual.</p>

<p>When founder Eugen Rochko started working on Mastodon, his focus
was on creating the code and conditions for the kind of social
media he envisioned. The legal setup was a means to an end, a
quick fix to allow him to continue operations. From the start, he
declared that Mastodon would not be for sale and would be free of
the control of a single wealthy individual, and he could ensure
that because he was the person in control, the only ultimate
decision-maker.</p>

  <p>With Zuckerberg going full Musk last week, we can no longer let
billionaires control our digital public square.</p>

<p>Bluesky is an opportunity to shake up the status quo. They have
built scaffolding for a new kind of social web. One where we all
have more say, choice and control.</p>

<p>But it will take independent funding and governance to turn
Bluesky’s underlying tech — the AT Protocol — into something
more powerful than a single app. We want to create an entire
ecosystem of interconnected apps and different companies that have
people’s interests at heart.</p>

<p>Free Our Feeds will build a new, independent foundation to help
make that happen.</p>

<p>With a team of “technical advisors and custodians” that includes both the executive director and the president of the Mozilla Foundation, I suspect this initiative might prove <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">as successful as Firefox</a>.</p>

## ★ One Bit of Anecdata That the Web Is Languishing Vis-à-Vis Native Mobile Apps

<p>Just after New Year’s some sort of underground cable screw-up resulted in our home, along with an irregular swath of our neighborhood, losing electricity for 26 hours. We don’t lose power often, and when we do, the outages are usually brief, but 26 hours felt pretty long — especially with the outside temperature below freezing and daylight hours near their calendric nadir. The icing on this particular outage’s frustration cake was that our power company, PECO<sup id="fnr1-2025-01-13"><a href="#fn1-2025-01-13">1</a></sup>, seemingly had no idea what exactly was wrong or how long it might take to fix.</p>

<p>The power went out around 10:30 am on January 2, and soon thereafter PECO was estimating that power would be restored by 2 pm. Then it was 4 pm, then it was briefly 2 pm again (despite the actual time then being <em>after</em> 2 pm — which is when I got the sinking feeling I should get the flashlights out), then they were claiming there were no known outages in our area, until

<p>Josh DuBose, reporting for KTLA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an emotional interview, Shelley Sykes, the mother of former
child actor Rory Sykes who died in their Malibu home amid the
Palisades Fire, shared her harrowing story and grieved the
devastating loss of her son. Shelley fought back tears recalling
the final moments with 32-year-old Rory, who was born blind and
lived with cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>On Jan. 7, when the Palisades Fire broke out, the mother and son
stayed behind at their Malibu home believing they were safe.
Overnight, though, as the wind-driven fire escalated and sent
embers flying onto their property, a massive flare up trapped
Rory, who has difficulty walking, inside his cottage.</p>

<p>“I drove up to the top of his cottage, turned on the hose pipe and
no water came out of it,” Shelley explained. “I raced back down
and dialed 911 but 911 wasn’t working and all the lines were down
for emergencies.”</p>

<p>Despite her best efforts, she says Rory locked himself i
