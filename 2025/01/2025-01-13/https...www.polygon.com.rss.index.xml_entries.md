<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Growing up in the mid-2000s, I woke up every morning to watch <em>Detective Conan</em> on our CRT TV as I ate “hotsilog” (hotdog, egg, and fried rice) for breakfast. On my way to school, I saw gas-guzzling jeepneys painted with Goku and Jesus on their sides, vividly colored. After class, I rushed home to catch however many minutes of <em>Slam Dunk</em> remained before the evening news began.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on the weekends, I looked through my dad’s countless anime DVDs for the <em>Voltes V</em> collection. Every episode in glorious 720×480, or at least that’s what the shady street vendor who sold it to my dad claimed. At that time, Filipinos w

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">With 5,381 people listed in its credits, CD Projekt Red’s <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is one of the game industry’s largest productions to date. And as it turns out, almost half of those people contributed to the game’s localization.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of Polygon’s Culture Shock issue, we asked developer CD Projekt Red to shed light on the work involved in localizing a project of this scale — an open-world game containing approximately 1.1 million words translated into 19 languages, and nearly 82,000 lines recorded by voice actors in 11 of those languages. The studio broke down the numbers, and talked us through why it took thousands of people to properly prepa

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">In 2000, shortly after the launch of <em>The Sims</em>, publisher Electronic Arts and developer Maxis discovered that the game was popular with a demographic EA had theretofore never seriously entertained: young women and teenage girls. “We never set out to make this a game that was popular with girls at all,” <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/sims-game-an-oral-history/">said original game designer Roxy Wolosenko in 2022</a>. “We were just making a game that was interesting to us. Girls just ended up finding it.” A happy accident upon which EA continues to capitalize, with a steady

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">When Bethesda released the slaughter-some-Nazis shooter <em>Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus</em> in 2017, thousands of copies featured an intentional, albeit surprising, omission: Hitler’s mustache.

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">There was a particular moment just a few hours into my <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> playthrough when I felt that I was truly witnessing something special. I was at Hulao Gate, the imposing fortress that defended the pass to the capital of Luoyang. As the Anti-Dong Zhuo Coalition marched to a clearing, fully confident in their numbers, I waited with bated breath knowing what was about to happen. Suddenly, one soldier stammered, “I-it’s Lu Bu!”</p>
