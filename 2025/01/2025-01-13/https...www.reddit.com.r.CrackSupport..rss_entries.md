<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I apologize in advance if this is a really dumb thing to have an issue with, I just don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing or how I messed up. I tried following the manual installation instructions for the ea dlc unlocker v2, and I get stuck at step 4, because I can&#39;t find the &#39;AppData&#39; folder. I get to &quot;C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;&quot;, but there is no &#39;AppData&#39; folder for me to continue to the next steps. Is the problem with me/ a mistake I made?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This new windows 11 update, 24h2 just breaks things. Some legit games copies aren&#39;t even launching too.</p> <p>Far cry 6 and 5 just shows loading screen and then crashes. GTA 5 crashes after 5-10 minutes.</p> <p>is there still no fix for this problem caused by 24H2 update?</p> <p>I should&#39;ve switched to linux a long time ago. Most of us who are having this problem cannot go back to previous windows version we am sure most of us have exceeded the 10 days time to revert back.</p> <p>Anyone have found the fix yet for game not launching in 24H2?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheStubbornSurfer"> /u/TheStubbornSurfer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1i06v8m/game_not_launching_on_windows_11_24h2_still_no_fix/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1i06v8m/game_not_launching_on_windows_11_24h2_still_no_fix/"
