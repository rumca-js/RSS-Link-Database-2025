<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks! 👋 I&#39;m a web developer building a new feed aggregator and I&#39;d love your input on what would make it truly awesome. </p> <p>I&#39;ve got the basics working: - Standard feed/article support (RSS/Atom) - Text-to-speech for listening to articles on the go - Browser extension for easy subscribing - Dedicated email address to forward newsletters</p> <p>But I want to make something that actually solves YOUR pain points with current readers. What features would make you instantly switch from your current solution? What annoys you most about existing feed readers?</p> <p>Looking for any suggestions - from basic must-haves to wild &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if...&quot; ideas.</p> <p>As a thank you, I&#39;ll be giving out free premium accounts to the most insightful responses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FrancoCanzani"> /u/FrancoCanzani </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! Very new to RSS, somewhat new to having my own website so I’m sorry if this is a noob question. Is there a way to use RSS to show my bluesky posts on my neocities hosted website? I’m imagining a little feed that I can put anywhere like a chat box. Could it work that way? Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/greenhouse404"> /u/greenhouse404 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i0luim/rss_and_bluesky_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i0luim/rss_and_bluesky_question/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, since yesterday my Reddit rss feeds are updating erratically. It’s not a problem related to my reader because the feed itself does not update so often.
