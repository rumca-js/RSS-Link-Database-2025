For me it doesn’t have anything to do with my sexuality. I’m just interested in hearing other lesbians perspectives/experiences who believe? I think it’s a super powerful thing, but I don’t see a lot of it conversation around it in the community. I always have people asking how it’s possible and for me to be a lesbian &amp; also believe in God &amp; I guess it just is??? Do you think it’s just the “Christian God” stereotype that makes it confusing for others to understand or just because belief is complex and sensitive in general?</p> <p>(Disclaimer: I 100% respect those who have different beliefs &amp; know that each person’s beliefs are equally true in their own experience) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Immediate_Disaster36"> /u/Immediate_Disaste
