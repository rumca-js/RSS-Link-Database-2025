Perspectives on Contracts for C++ - Lisa Lippincott - CppCon 2024
---

For many years, members of the C++ working group, WG21, have tried to add support for contract assertions — preconditions, postconditions, and assertion statements within a function body — to the C++ language. It’s been a long and difficult road, but we now have a proposal (P2900, “Contracts for C++”) to add significant contract support in, we hope, C++26, with more complete support to follow in C++29.

Looking back, the contracts feature has been unusually difficult and contentious. I contend that the difficulty is inherent in the feature: a contracts facility, by its nature,  cannot be understood from any single point of view.

In this lecture, I will explain why understanding contracts requires seeing the feature from a panoply of perspectives, and show how shifting between these perspectives allows one to make effective use of the facility.

This lecture is derived from presentations m
