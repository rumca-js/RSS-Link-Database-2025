I then installed MangoHud (version 0.7.2) and Steam (proton version 8.0-5). My games launched without any tinkering. At first MangoHud wouldn&#39;t recognize my config file, but I got MangoHud to work properly in CK2 by using &quot;MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE=&quot;/home/me/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf&quot; mangohud %command%&quot; launch option. However, when I use that same launch option for other steam games, like skyrim and arkham origins, the game launches but MangoHud does not run. Any ideas for how to troubleshoot this? I looked into why MangoHud would only work for some games and I read somethings about how you need to configure MangoHud differently for OpenGL and Vulkan, and 32 vs 64 bit, but I didn&#39;t understand what needed to be done. Please help if you can.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/higgins5793\"> /u/higgins5793 ",

Its currently the only game that for me is 100% borked on Manjaro after switching from Windows. I tried many fixes recommended by people on this sub + whatever else I found online but nothing seemed to work. Recently I tried making it work again and I discovered that the thing causing crashes was my VRAM being completely overflowed so much so that the game starts also flooding my RAM to the point where it crashes. Initially I thought it was purely a RAM issue but after comparing RAM usage with a friend of mine that is on Linux Mint ( we both have 16GB on our machines ) we figured something was wrong as his RAM usage was constant while mine was ever increasing. Only then I checked the VRAM",

I tried to enable triple buffering but any time I force composition pipeline the games just completely freeze in fullscreen. Borderless also has the same issue in games, so my only option is to set the game to windowed which is a fucking eyesore. My GPU is a 1080 and I&#39;m using nvidia&#39;s proprietary drivers (nouveau does not work I&#39;ve tried) on X11 KDE Plasma. The severity of the issue also seems to vary depending on the game, with RDR2 its fixed when I go in and out of fullscreen, with a few FPS games I play sometimes its there but mostly ignorable, and in other games the whole screen will be flickering with a very pronounced line.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/notstupididiot\"> /u/notstupididiot ",
