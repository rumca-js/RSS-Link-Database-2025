Their Music too tbh and instantly became a fan. Yvonne is from Paisley [same town as the glorious Paolo Nutini]. Yvonne&#39;s music is considered Folk, although IMO she covers several genres including Soft Rock, Jazz, and Blues. The themes of her songs are usually mental health, politics, major societal issues, and Scottish patriotism, among so much more. </p> <p>I&#39;d like to introduce you to Yvonne by suggesting 3 fantastic songs. and you can decide then for yourself to delve deeper. </p> <p>IMHO she deserves greater recognition.
