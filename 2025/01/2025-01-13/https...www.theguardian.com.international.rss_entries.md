<p>The highly emotional new crime drama about the horrific murder case in Sweden that went unsolved for 16 years is a cracking and courageous watch. No wonder it’s raced up the Netflix charts …</p><p>Time is a main character in The Breakthrough, the lean, eloquent Swedish crime drama that recently powered into Netflix’s Top 10. It is a fictionalised retelling of a true story, about the huge and painstaking police investigation into a horrific double murder that took place in 2004 in the city of Linköping. It begins with a father teaching his eight-year-old son how to use his watch and over four episodes holds time up to the light. In The Breakthrough, time drags. A case that should have been cracked quickly goes unsolved for 16 years. Then, as technology catches up to the evidence, time lurches forward, setting an awful, tense and thrilling deadline for all involved. This is clever and sensitive crime TV that demands you watch it carefully and treats its subject matter with the respe

<p>The multiverse has has made room for a lot of unlikely reinventions, but murmurs that the late actor’s iconic character may be reworked with a new star could prove controversial</p><p>Marvel’s multiverse has become a narrative Swiss army knife capable of slicing through the thorniest of creative dilemmas and papering over the widest of cracks. That said, few dilemmas are as sensitive as how to move forward with a superhero as iconic as Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman’s portrayal of T’Challa wasn’t just a performance – it was a cultural touchstone, woven so tightly into the fabric of modern blockbuster cinema that imagining anyone else in the role feels like attempting to rewrite history. Four years after Boseman’s untimely death from colon cancer, Marvel faces the delicate task of continuing a legacy that seems impossible to replicate.<br><br>

<p>The notion that it’s bad to be brought up without siblings should be banished for good</p><p>When I was growing up, only children were generally regarded as unfortunate souls; lonely, socially clumsy and often bullied. Partly, this was because they were unusual back then, and as those who’ve observed just about any species know, unusual individuals tend to be singled out by the pack. Today we live in a different world. From the late 1960s and 70s, the contraceptive pill, women’s increasing control over their lives and IVF meant that parents were better able to plan their families and often chose to make them smaller. The single child no longer stuck out so much.</p><p>But the stereotype has proved to be tenacious – so much so that many people still feel anxiety about the issue: parents over whether they have deprived their child of the experience of having siblings, only children that they may have missed out on a crucial part of their&nbsp;development.</p> <a href="https://www.th

However, unlike the other bowls, with their pick’n’mix of clothes pegs, coins, aspirin, Ikea pencils, cables, wet wipes, sunglasses, business cards, Kinder Surprise figures and Sellotape chewed by the dog, the salad bowl is a holding (or dumping) place for just one thing: bread crusts.

<p>Is tech calling the shots in your life? From making AI work smarter to tracking stolen phones, our expert explains how to get ahead</p><p>Asking ChatGPT to write your emails is so two years ago. Generative AI tools are now going beyond the basic text-prompt phase. Take Google’s <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a>, an experimental “AI research assistant” that lets you upload not just text but also videos, links and PDFs. It will provide a summary of the content, answer questions about it, and even make a podcast-like “AI overview” if you want it to – all while organising your original sources and notes. As AI tools advance, expect more features like this to be baked into everyday software. All the usual caveats of using AI apply: the responsibility for factchecking lies with you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/13/stay-on-top-of-tech-five-ways-to-take-back-control-from-emails-to-ai">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From run-ins with Hemingway in Havana to gunmen in Guatemala, this colourful collection of the late writer’s long-form journalism shows why Graham Greene was an admirer</p><p>The travelogues of Norman Lewis, which are much admired for the extraordinary burnish they attain, were written by him in a spidery longhand. The author of acclaimed accounts of the Sicilian mafia and the exploitation of Indigenous tribes in South America, he scribbled his rewrites on fresh scraps of paper and, with the help of his wife Lesley, pasted them over earlier drafts until his manuscript crackled like parchment. I observed this process for myself when I interviewed the writer, by then in his 90s. We were at his home, an old rectory in deepest Essex enclosed by a wild garden which grew as high as an elephant’s eye. Here he recuperated between adventures in an “introspective, almost monastic calm”, or so the blurb on his book jackets improbably claimed. Rangy and moustachioed, he had been an early adop

<p>Rightwing leaders such as Meloni and Orbán set themselves up as Trump whisperers – but they only want to preserve their own interests </p><p>A far-right wind is blowing across the Atlantic. While the rise of the populist right in Europe predated Donald Trump’s re-election, far-right parties, leaders and governments across Europe are being bolstered by his imminent return to power, and by Elon Musk’s rising political star. There is some hope that Trump’s presidency could have a unifying effect on Europe – and on issues such as defence policy, I believe it might.</p><p>Trump’s apparent disregard for international law, sovereign borders and the US’s Nato allies with his ludicrous threat, even before his second term begins, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/07/trump-panama-canal-greenland">annex Greenland by force</a>, drew a swift and unified reaction from France, Germany and Spain, whose leaders made it clear that they are, as you would expect, appalled and st

The science is not on their side<strong> </strong></p><p>Seed oils are in many foods. They are usually cheap and easy to cook with, and their inoffensive taste means they can be used in a huge variety of things. Go on any social media platform, though, and you will find self-appointed health influencers blaming them for everything from inflammation to the obesity epidemic. Politicians do it too: the man Donald Trump wants for his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has claimed that Americans are being <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze391y17z7o">“unknowingly poisoned”</a> by them.

Largely shot inside women-only carriages, Rebana Liz John’s compelling documentary lends an ear to the everyday stories that would have otherwise been lost amid the incredible flow of urban dwellers.
