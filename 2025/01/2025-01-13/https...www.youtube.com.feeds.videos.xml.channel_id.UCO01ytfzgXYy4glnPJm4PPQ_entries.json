Also, Gavin Newsom flails around desperately looking for someone other than himself to blame for California\u2019s disastrous response to the wildfires. Some college students stage a \u201cTo Catch A Predator\u201d-style sting operation to expose a 22-year-old man who was trying to go on a date with an 18-year-old. It\u2019s \u201cTo Catch A Predator,\u201d minus the predator. And, a woman on TikTok goes viral with a video claiming to reveal one of the most important secrets of male psychology\u2014and for once, the TikToker actually isn\u2019t wrong.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:33 Opening\n01:59 - 15:55 Wokeness Is Dying\n17:11 - 26:55 Gavin Newsom Continues To Make A Disaster Out Of California\n26:56 - 37:27 College Students Set Up TikTok-Inspired Trap, Falsely Accuse Man Of Being A Predator\n37:28 - 42:45 Chicago Mayor Is Asked Why His Constituents Hate Him So Much\n44:00 - 50:22 The Comments",
