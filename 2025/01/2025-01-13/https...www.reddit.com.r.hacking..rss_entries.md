<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently had the honor of presenting a covert channel proof of concept project at ShmooCon 2025 that uses the connection ID field in the QUIC protocol to embed encrypted payloads while still confirming to the entropy requirements of that field.</p> <p>Built this for a 2-week assignment in a Covert Channels class I was taking so very much a proof of concept piece of work. Welcome discussions/critique/etc on the project. Link below to the GitHub project and the YouTube video of the talk. A white paper (that needs some corrections) is also available on the GitHub.</p> <p>Overall the talk is about the process of building a covert channel and the importance of being critical of one&#39;s own work. Hope you all enjoy!</p> <p>YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/-_jUZBMeU5w?t=20857&amp;si=qJZSSWWVdLd-3zVM">https://youtu.be/-_jUZBMeU5w?t=20857&amp;si=qJZSSWWVdLd-3zVM</a></p> <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/nuvious/QuiCC">https://github.com/nuvious/Qui

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I know this might be a bit off-topic but me and my friend are doing sort of &quot;virus&quot; hunting. Once every few years my friend gets too frustrated with playing League of Legends and so here I come with ways to make him stop playing the game. The goal of the executable is to simply kills the game every minute or two.</p> <p>Since we are both developers, hiding the file is not so easy. First time I did this by simply adding file to startup, that was way too simple. Second time I created an service/ timer job and named it GoogleServices. That one was very effective and he did not find it until I told him where it is. </p> <p>Now&#39;s the time of the year again to help my friend drop this game, so my question is how could I hide the executable so he would not find it easily? For now I am thinking of Startup registry key, maybe leveraging environment variables somehow. Obviously anything that shows in task manager is going to be instantly f

Is it true that IP cameras are generally less secure?
