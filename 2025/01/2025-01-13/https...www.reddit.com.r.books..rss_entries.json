For example, Primo Levi described himself as <em>\u201cItalian citizen of the Jewish race\u201d.</em> Stefan Zweig wrote of Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, that <em>\u201cTheodore Herzl showed me the greatness of our race\u201d</em>.

Lily Blossom Bloom, main character of <em>It Ends With Us</em> by Colleen Hoover, and a florist. It\u2019s just too much. And there\u2019s this book called <em>Powerless</em> by Lauren Roberts with a main character named Paedyn. I think Peyton would have also been a strange choice for a character in a fantasy novel, but at least it\u2019s spelled normally.

If she just used speech marks then there\u2019s infinite ways of expressing who is saying what but the refusal to use speech marks means she has to tell us it\u2019s speech otherwise it looks like narration. It\u2019s such a jarring stop start writing style to me. Clearly I\u2019m in the minority because people love this book, it has 1.6m ratings on good reads and a 3.81 which is pretty high for the literary girlies. I feel like her not using speech marks, whilst this creates a more conversational vibe to the book it massively limits the ability to add any sort of undertone to the speech.

Brilliant piece of literature from Lionel Shriver. The spine chilling moments, internal turmoils, unsettling exchanges, and leaden silences, all delivered in perfect pitch. The only issue I had initially was the vocabulary. Certain paragraphs read like someone pressed ctrl+A on the keyboard and applied thesaurus (English is not my first language, so this perception could be subjective). So I&#39;m curious. Was that intentional from the author? Using such complex vocabulary to convey the sophisticated nature of Eva? After a point, it did not bother me much because I was so invested in all the messed up things that were happening and the vocab was the least of my concerns or maybe I just got used to it.
