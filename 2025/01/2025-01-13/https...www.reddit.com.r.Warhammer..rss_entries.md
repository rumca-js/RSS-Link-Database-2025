## Do citadel paints “go off”?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to start this by saying I have 0 clue about things like painting and whatnot, I played warhammer 40k and AoS for about 5 years but stopped during lockdown as I couldn’t go to the club, I collected a few armies including Stormcast Eternals, Slaves to Darkness, Khorne and Space Marines, but never really did much of the painting. I painted the Space Marines blue with black guns but that was pretty much it. </p> <p>Now I’m getting back into warhammer as I’ve joined a uni club for it, and I’m more interested in the painting side as I’ve gotten more into art in the past few months. Although since it’s been about 3 or 4 years, some of my paints seem to have gone weird? One of my gold paints seems to have gone completely white and a lot of my base paints have just gone weird. </p> <p>Is this normal or is it to do with the conditions they were kept in (eg too warm too cold) Any help would be appreciated thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b

## FYI: It's 180 *working* days for Made To Order

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just a quick PSA for anyone ordering Made To Order stuff - the timeline they offer is 180 <em>working days</em>, not 180 calendar days - despite what the website implies. </p> <p>With the Admech terrain from June last year, that would be <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/weekdayadd.html?d1=02&amp;m1=06&amp;y1=2024&amp;">~268 calendar days</a>, or closer to <strong>9 months</strong> (in Australia anyway). That&#39;s ~48% higher than what they tell you on the ordering page.</p> <p>Not complaining as such - it&#39;ll take as long as it takes - but as best I can tell, the &#39;working day&#39; disclaimer only gets added in after your order has been made. It would be good if GW was a little more transparent about that, as if you&#39;re buying anticipating that it&#39;ll be ready for a birthday or tournament or something, you could get stung.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wcmbk"> /u/wcmbk </a
