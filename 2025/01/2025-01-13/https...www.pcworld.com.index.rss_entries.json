In fact, it allows you to bypass the need for an internet connection altogether. It just so happens that one of our favorites \u2014 Samsung\u2019s Type-C Flash Drive \u2014 is on sale right now, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Type-CTM-Transfers-Compatible-Waterproof/dp/B09WB2RPS4/\">128GB model available for a mere $18 on Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the fact that this modern flash drive is a total steal at this price, this particular flash drive is awesome because, as the name suggests, it has a USB-C connection. That means it\u2019s so easy to back up data from smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Samsung Type-C Flash Drive is tiny, too, making it easy to throw into a pocket or purse and take with you anywhere. It\u2019s also built ",

Indeed, YouTube is probably <em>hoping </em>Sunday Ticket subscribers forget about their memberships\u2013at least until next season\u2019s kickoff.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason? NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube and YouTube TV has an auto-renewal feature that automatically resubs users for the following season\u2014and once you\u2019re re-subscribed, there are no refunds.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The date when YouTube or YouTube TV will automatically renew your NFL Sunday Ticket subscription may vary; you can find the renewal date in your YouTube accounts details (more on that in a moment). Most likely, your NFL Sunday Ticket renewal date will hit a few weeks before the 2025-26 regular season begins.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, but w",

Now, almost a decade later, a major peripheral company says that it\u2019s time once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DisplayLink, which is owned by Synaptics, used CES to start pitching the idea of connecting an Android phone via a USB-C cable to a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/best-displaylink-docks.html\">DisplayLink docking station</a>. The company demonstrated a physical link to the dock, with a pair of connected displays using the phone\u2019s CPU and GPU to render images. It also showed off a wireless version, with a connection running on top of Wi-Fi to an external dongle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s an important distinction: These phones don\u2019t just mirror the home screen.
