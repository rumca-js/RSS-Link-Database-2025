Here are the two main things I&#39;m trying to better understand: </p> <ol> <li>Russia and China&#39;s cybersecurity overall strategies. Newer the better, but I also want to have good historical context for the past 15 years or so. </li> <li>Aside from warfare, what kind of geopolitical changes would affect cybersecurity and in what way? For instance, would the increased tariffs on China by the US only increase the typical cyber attacks by China, or would there be a more specific kind of retaliation? What about the cutting of the undersea cables? What about food or mineral scarcity? These are just some examples. </li> </ol> <p>Overall, when I see a geopolitical change, I want to know if it will affect cybersecurity and in what way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kimbobinator\"> /u/Kimbobinator </a> <br/> <span><a href=",

I have tried alot of AI chatbots to help me fix the SIEM queries and or to have it give me suggestions or write me a very refined queries for specific needs. But chatgpt or even others are just soo bad at SIEM queries.

My plan is to offer affordable bundles that address essential cybersecurity needs, especially for companies that lack a dedicated IT or security team.
