<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, so I started trying to dig into the files for Freedom Wars Remastered and discovered some interesting stuff.</p> <p>For one, the models and skeleton files are have different file extensions, but are the same as the .emd and .esk files in Xenoverse and Xenoverse 2. So ripping the models and converting them to .fbx files uses the same tools as that series.</p> <p>However, instead of using a .cpk file to hold it&#39;s models it uses a .eaf file. So this is where the xenoverse tools seem lose their usefulness as I can&#39;t repack the .eaf with what&#39;s there.</p> <p>The game does use .cpk files, but adding anything to them won&#39;t override what&#39;s in the .eaf file.</p> <p>Does anyone have any experience working with .eaf files? I&#39;d appreciate any advice or even pointing me in the direction of existing tools that may help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Orbiter088"> /u/Orbite
