Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Mark Zuckerberg’s interview with Joe Rogan is yet more evidence that wokeness is dying—if not already dead. Also, Gavin Newsom flails around desperately looking for someone other than himself to blame for California’s disastrous response to the wildfires. Some college students stage a “To Catch A Predator”-style sting operation to expose a 22-year-old man who was trying to go on a date with an 18-year-old. It’s “To Catch A Predator,” minus the predator. And, a woman on TikTok goes viral with a video claiming to reveal one of the most important secrets of male psychology—and for once, the TikToker actually isn’t wrong.
