For example if you google &quot;reddit nfl stream&quot; it brings you to a site with about 25 different streaming sites. </p> <p>Is this just the illusion of choice? So many times when watching EVERY single stream will go down simultaneously. Hard to believe these are independent sites when every single once fails at the same time.</p> <p>Also sometimes the streams weirdly get in a loop. You will refresh and they all start at the exact same point in time in the stream, and all error out at the exact frame across all sites. What on earth is going on.

The big corporations sit in their glass towers, hoarding more money than any human could spend in ten lifetimes, and they still have the audacity to block movies, shows, and games just because the numbers don’t add up for them. It’s not about art; it’s about greed. And what do they offer us, the everyday people? Streaming services that raise their prices every six months, force you to pay extra so the picture doesn’t look like a VHS from the &#39;90s, and even have the nerve to include ads.
