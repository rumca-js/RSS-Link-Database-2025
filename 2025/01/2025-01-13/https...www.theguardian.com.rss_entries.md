<p>The hit Aussie comedy about teenage parents has matured into something relatable, genuinely funny and frequently devastating. It will be missed</p><p>The first series of Australian comedy Bump was an indubitably high-concept affair. Mere minutes after we were introduced to uptight, intellectually ferocious, all-round-type-A schoolgirl Oly, her life had been turned upside down. A sudden stomachache in the playground quickly progressed into vomiting in the school toilets then full-blown labour in the back of an ambulance – but know-it-all Oly (Nathalie Morris) had no inkling she was even pregnant. That the father was not her similarly nerdy boyfriend Lachie but a mildly delinquent classmate called Santiago (“Santi”) added even more world-shattering horror into the mix.</p><p>Birth did not magically bestow Oly with motherly instincts. “Get that thing away from me,” she snarled when introduced to her newborn daughter. But once the shellshock and fury had dissipated, she did manage to

<p>To date, US hedge fund has been able to lob insults at targets while escaping detailed scrutiny</p><p>The great advantage of hostile takeover battles for public companies is that you get a clean punch-up. The records of both parties – bidder and target – are put in the spotlight. Every claim is tested in open argument over many weeks. At the end of the process, shareholders make an informed choice. Voting turnout is usually high because only the most dozy investors fail to notice what’s at stake.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/jan/06/uk-investment-trusts-saba-boaz-weinstein">the current scrap for control of seven UK investment trusts</a> is not like that.

<p>After a few years of financial shocks, our expert explains what to do now ensure your money is fit for the future</p><p>The past few years have taught us that it’s pretty hard to guess what financial shocks are around the corner, so all of this is written with the caveat that 2025 might not go as expected.</p><p>But assuming we face a bit of stability, we are looking ahead to a time when prices for groceries, energy, homewares and other daily spending will plateau or maybe even go down. Interest rates are expected to fall too, as the Bank of England stops worrying about inflation and attempts to put a bit of fuel back in the economy. All of this means there are some jobs to do with your finances:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jan/13/be-right-on-the-money-four-ways-to-fix-your-finances-in-2025">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vivianne Miedema and Lauren James return from injury as Villa hit nine and Cheltenham’s historic run comes to an end</p><p>It has been a turbulent two years for Vivianne Miedema since rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament. Knee issues have plagued her return to full fitness, the latest of which had ruled her out since October.

<p>Freddie Prinze Jr plays a middle-aged man-boy trying to cover up a death in this  thriller that may be saved by the fact that it knows it’s ridiculously silly</p><p>The opening is reasonably suspenseful: in Los Angeles, middle-aged Thomas (Freddie Prinze Jr) is skipping off work on his birthday to spend quality time with his much younger girlfriend Hannah (Gabrielle Haugh), only to find her floating face-down in the pool. Panicked, Thomas shoves her body into a chest – then his wife comes home early. It’s not a bad setup, but it’s almost impossible to work out what The Girl in the Pool is meant to be. Is it a comedy about middle-aged male stupidity, or a naff throwback to 80s thrillers that gave beautiful, emotionally unstable homewreckers what was coming to them?</p><p>Providing the movie with its comic undertone is a funny (intentionally, I think) performance from Prinze Jr as dim-bulb Thomas. He’s constantly repeating: “I’m going to fix this.” The evidence suggests otherwise. T

Now the pair have become an unlikely folk-pop powerhouse</p><p>Baba Stiltz and Okay Kaya’s collaboration was like a long-shot blind date, set up by a mutual friend who figured they’d make beautiful music together. Stiltz was an electronic composer and Kaya was a maverick singer-songwriter. Their recording session was almost scuppered when the producer skipped town before they arrived at the studio. But against all odds, the pair’s debut EP, Blurb, is a laconic treat of smart, vulnerable folk-pop in the left-field lineage of the Velvet Underground and Bill Callahan. “We clicked,” grins Kaya Wilkins, AKA Okay Kaya, “like the buckle on a belt.”</p><p>They met in Stockholm, at Pitchers, which Stiltz describes as “a weird simulacrum of a British pub, decorated with wallpaper of bookshelves – a very strange, specifically <em>Scandinavian</em> place”.

Share them with Jonathan <a href="mailto:daniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com">via email</a></li></ul><p><strong>Coco Gauff is in action in about 15 minutes,</strong> leading the charge for an emerging younger breed of US grand slam contenders.</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/18/coco-gauff-brad-gilbert-split-tennis-coach">her much-discussed break with coach Brad Gilbert</a> after her disappointing US Open performance (losing to fellow American Emma Navarro, who is the eighth seed in Australia), Gauff’s record is an extraordinary 18-2 since the US Open. With new coach Matt Daly, Gauff has ironed out much of the issues with her forehand and serve and is playing a brand of highly confident tennis. Further, the fact that Gauff is one of the fastest players on tour and possesses a very strong mindset makes her somewhat upset-proof in the bigger events.</p> <a href="https:/
