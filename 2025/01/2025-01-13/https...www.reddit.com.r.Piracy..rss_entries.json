I&#39;m new to this kind of stuff but i managed to run everything on my macbook and i&#39;m pretty satisfied. I took a look at qnap and synology websites and i need to decide between Synology DS723+ and QNAP TS-264. </p> <p>The Synology is a bit more expensive and it also requires ram upgrade from 2 to 16gb but it&#39;s ok. The main questions are:</p> <p>-Which one is better for 4k streaming ? -which one has the best software?</p> <p>I also thought to mount 2 4TB ironwolf pro HD with raid 1 setup and one m2 1tb device. I don&#39;t know If it&#39;s possible ( and if it&#39;s a good choice) but I&#39;d like to use the M2 drive to download an unpack files and then move them to the ironwolf HD because it&#39;s faster.
