<p>Google <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/01/release-notes-01-10-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently announced</a> a new update to its Google Drive cloud storage service that will make it much faster to synchronize your local copy of files on your computer with those stored in the cloud.</p>



<p>To understand how this works, consider one really huge text document that’s maybe 1GB in size. Before, Google Drive would re-upload the entire file to the cloud whenever you made a change, even if it was to change a single letter in the entire document. Not very efficient.</p>



<p>Now, with the new “differential uploads” feature, Google Drive is smart enough to know which parts of the file have changed — and only upload <em>those</em> parts to the cloud for synchronization.</p>



<p>The end result is a much faster s

<p>One of my favorite things to come out of CES 2025 was the spread of SteamOS to other PC gaming handhelds, namely a new version of Lenovo’s Legion Go. On the show floor, PCWorld’s Adam Patrick Murray got his handheld-loving hands all over both versions of the Legion Go S — one running SteamOS, the other running Windows 11.</p>



<p>The white version of the new handheld will rock Windows 11, as did the original model, while the “Nebula Violet” (it’s black, cool it with the branding Lenovo) is the one running <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2567576/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-non-valve-steamos-gaming-handheld.html">a Valve-approved build of SteamOS</a>. All versions of the Legion Go S get an 8-inch 1920×1200 LCD display with 120Hz and support for VRR. The Ryzen Z2 Go processor is paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage on an M.2 2242 drive,

<p>Fresh out of CES 2025, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Multi-Device-Charging-Retractable/dp/B0DCBB2YTR/">high-capacity Anker power bank is already on sale</a>. Sure, it’s not something crazy like a half-off deal, but a 10 percent discount less than a week after release is noteworthy.</p>



<p>Anker’s 25,000mAh portable power bank delivers a maximum 100W charge per USB-C port, and it packs three of them. That means you can use this to super-fast-charge up to three laptops, tablets, smartphones, or other USB-C gadgets at the same time.</p>



<p>Two of those ports exist as built-in retractable USB-C cables. One is located on the top part of the power bank and clicks into place, while the second comes out of the side of the device and doubles as a carrying strap (which can be rather handy to have, so don’t underestimate it).</p>

<p>These days, getting a mini PC can make a lot more sense than splurging on a laptop or desktop PC, mainly because you can get better specs for less money. The price-performance is nearly unbeatable.</p>



<p>Right now, for instance, you can get this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-PCle4-0-Computer-Support-Display/dp/B0DKF15XQJ/">Beelink SER8 mini PC for just $499 on Amazon</a>, a sizable 21 percent discount off its original $629 price — and this thing packs a lot of power for that price.</p>



<p>For starters, it has an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor alongside a whopping 32GB of DDR5 RAM. That’s a solid combination that will allow you to tackle any tasks you want, whether for work or fun, including photo editing and keeping 100 tabs open in Chrome. It also features AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics for moderate gaming.</p>

<p>Pump-and-dumps and other fraud schemes have become synonymous with cryptocurrency, with everyone from political leaders to YouTube influencers accused of using crypto FOMO to make a quick buck at the expense of their followers. But one Washington pastor decided his own church flock was an appropriate place to start fleecing, according to the US Department of Justice. </p>



<p>The DoJ has charged Francier Obando Pinillo, the former pastor of a church in Pasco, Washington state, with 26 counts of fraud.

<p>For several months now, Microsoft has been urging Windows users to switch over to the new Outlook app, with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2551776/classic-outlook-gets-an-official-death-date-microsoft.html">classic Outlook recently getting an official “death date”</a>.

<p>I’ve been trying hard to resist the urge to upgrade my monitors to OLED for a while now, reserving said money for silly inconsequential things like food and gasoline. But it looks like a lot of other PC gamers have made the switch already. According to a statement attributed to LG, more than a fifth of gaming monitors are now using upgraded OLED panels. </p>



<p>The sourcing on this one is a little circuitous, to be honest.

<p>Could 2024 have been any worse for Sonos? The once-beloved connected speaker brand left its reputation in tatters after a rushed, misguided app update, then launched a pair of pricey headphones that, from all accounts, landed with a thud. </p>



<p>Faced with a mob of enraged users, Sonos has repeatedly apologized and laid out elaborate plans for how it will do better. But sometimes, “sorry” isn’t enough, and now Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is taking the last option open to him: resignation. </p>



<p>In a press release early Monday, Sonos announced that <a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2025/Sonos-Announces-CEO-Transition/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spence is stepping down immediately as CEO</a> and as a member of the company’s board of directors.  </p>

<p>Microsoft can’t be happy about the Steam Deck. After all, PC gaming has long been about Windows. For decades! Yet now one of the hottest PC gaming systems is… a portable Linux PC that runs Windows games? That’s right. The Steam Deck has really taken off.</p>



<p>To make matters worse for Microsoft, Windows just doesn’t work well on gaming handhelds. Years after its launch, the Steam Deck is still <em>the</em> handheld gaming PC to buy. (No wonder <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-would-buy-valve-if-opportunity-arises-said-phil-spencer-in-leaked-email/">Microsoft wanted to buy both Valve and Nintendo</a>, according to leaked confidential documents!)</p>

While the desktop GeForce RTX 5090 garnered the most awe with its impressive specs, we also saw laptop GPUs — and these mobile GPUs might foreshadow what we can expect from the as-of-yet unannounced desktop GPUs, like the RTX 5060.</p>



<p>The laptop GPUs come in RTX 5070, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5090 flavors. But the thing is, Nvidia’s laptop GPUs don’t follow the same specs as their desktop counterparts (for obvious reasons of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2413664/why-are-gaming-laptops-so-expensive.html">smaller form factors and thermal headroom</a>).
