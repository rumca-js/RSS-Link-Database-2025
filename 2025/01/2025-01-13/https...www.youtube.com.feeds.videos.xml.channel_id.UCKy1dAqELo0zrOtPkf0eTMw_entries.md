Watch our Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare review by Matt Donato. Don't miss what we think of the new fantasy horror film in this IGN movie review.

Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare takes itself more seriously than its predecessors in Rhys Frake-Waterfield’s Twisted Childhood Universe, which is a problem. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 star turned Neverland Nightmare director Scott Jeffrey strives to accentuate his main character’s arrested adolescence by turning the boy who never grew up into a serial killer and kidnapper – keeping him more grounded than the typical pirates-and-fairies image of Peter Pan. As Wendy Darling squares off against this throat-slashing, brother-snatching version of Peter, Jeffrey skips the imaginative sparkle of the stories that inspired his film. Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare might be bleak and gory, but more notably, it’s a dull adaptation of Peter Pan’s adventures that makes him no different than a thousand other van-driving murderers who’ve come an

Dynasty Warriors: Origins reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.

If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast make this story sing. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark.
