        "description": "2024 was a big year for video games, but it also marked the arrival of Final Fantasy 16 on PC. 2025 is kicking off similarly, with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth also arriving for the platform on January 23rd after receiving numerous awards and widespread critical acclaim.\n\nAs the second part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake project, Rebirth follows the story of Cloud and his friends as they escape Midgar to pursue Sephiroth. The wider world and its inhabitants await, including newcomers to the party like Yuffie and Cait Sith, and Synergy Abilities to unlock. Exploration is more varied, with more extensive environments to discover.\n\nThen you have all the additional content with new side quests, mini-games, tougher bosses, and much more. It's a pretty sizable experience spanning dozens of hours, but what does the PC version have to offer in terms of new features and graphical settings? Find out more here.",

        "description": "Dynasty Warriors: Origins serves as a reboot of the popular musou series, led by a sole amnesiac protagonist. The protagonist isn\u2019t the only narrative device used to wean newcomers into the setting and series; the game takes place at the very beginning, at the inception of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. \n\nThis game takes a zoomed-in approach, going in-depth on the origins of the three kingdoms rather than a zoomed-out historical sandbox. Origins also takes a more humorous approach regarding the popular Three Kingdoms characters. Fully voice-acted cutscenes and bond events help characterize series-staple officers like Cao Cao and Dong Zhuo.\n\nDespite these positive points, an inconsistent checkpoint system and the rather irritating instances of running around saving officers keeps Origins from being its best. Still, this is a great direction for the floundering series, and I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next.",

        "description": "Open world games generally tend to attract large audiences, which means it\u2019s not often that we play games in this space that don\u2019t appeal to a massive audience. Some, however, pride themselves on doing the exact opposite. \n\nIn 2024, for instance, the likes of Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 and Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl came along and left indelible impressions on their audiences, thanks in large part to how deliberately hostile they were to their players, refusing to hold your hand, and placing an extreme emphasis on emergent, systems-driven gameplay. \n\nThe upcoming Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 looks set to deliver a similar experience, and with the many improvements it\u2019s promising on its predecessor\u2019s foundations, there\u2019s every reason to be excited about what it is promising. Here, we talk about all of that and more.",
