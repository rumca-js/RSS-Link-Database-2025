<p>Having a fast flash drive on hand can save you the pain of transferring files over slow Wi-Fi. In fact, it allows you to bypass the need for an internet connection altogether. It just so happens that one of our favorites — Samsung’s Type-C Flash Drive — is on sale right now, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Type-CTM-Transfers-Compatible-Waterproof/dp/B09WB2RPS4/">128GB model available for a mere $18 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>Besides the fact that this modern flash drive is a total steal at this price, this particular flash drive is awesome because, as the name suggests, it has a USB-C connection. That means it’s so easy to back up data from smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, and more.</p>



<p>The Samsung Type-C Flash Drive is tiny, too, making it easy to throw into a pocket or purse and take with you anywhere. It’s also built

<p>With all the excitement of the NFL postseason, it’s easy to forget about NFL Sunday Ticket, the YouTube-hosted home for streaming out-of-market NFL games during the regular season. Indeed, YouTube is probably <em>hoping </em>Sunday Ticket subscribers forget about their memberships–at least until next season’s kickoff. </p>



<p>The reason? NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube and YouTube TV has an auto-renewal feature that automatically resubs users for the following season—and once you’re re-subscribed, there are no refunds. </p>



<p>The date when YouTube or YouTube TV will automatically renew your NFL Sunday Ticket subscription may vary; you can find the renewal date in your YouTube accounts details (more on that in a moment). Most likely, your NFL Sunday Ticket renewal date will hit a few weeks before the 2025-26 regular season begins. </p>

<p>If you type a lot, it’s pretty handy to be able to keep track of how many words you’ve typed, whether you’re filing a paper or any other document with a word count requirement, or even writing a novel.</p>



<p>Most word processors today can count how many words and characters exist in a document, but you usually have to dig around in menus or keep track of key combinations to get that counter up.</p>



<p>Wouldn’t it be easier to just take a quick glance at your keyboard to see how many words you’ve typed?</p>

<p>Eight to nine years ago, the Windows world was full of companies who thought it would be a great idea to turn a Windows phone into a PC. Now, almost a decade later, a major peripheral company says that it’s time once again.</p>



<p>DisplayLink, which is owned by Synaptics, used CES to start pitching the idea of connecting an Android phone via a USB-C cable to a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/801587/best-displaylink-docks.html">DisplayLink docking station</a>. The company demonstrated a physical link to the dock, with a pair of connected displays using the phone’s CPU and GPU to render images. It also showed off a wireless version, with a connection running on top of Wi-Fi to an external dongle.</p>



<p>But there’s an important distinction: These phones don’t just mirror the home screen. Instead, they act like a typical multi-monitor Windows s

<p>It’s been a while since I felt a profound case of gadget lust at CES, the tech trade show that takes over Las Vegas every January, but that’s what happened when I picked up <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2567576/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-non-valve-steamos-gaming-handheld.html">Lenovo’s Legion Go S</a> gaming handheld.</p>



<p>I’m already a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1501480/master-your-steam-deck-with-these-22-tips-and-tricks.html">satisfied Steam Deck owner</a>, but the Legion Go S has a larger and sharper screen with 120Hz refresh rates, AMD’s new Z2 chipset, and—to my hands, at least—perfect ergonomics. It also runs SteamOS, and Valve’s plan to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2570630/interview-valve-talks-steamos-on-third-party-handhelds.html">license its software for free to other handheld device makers</a> (sta
