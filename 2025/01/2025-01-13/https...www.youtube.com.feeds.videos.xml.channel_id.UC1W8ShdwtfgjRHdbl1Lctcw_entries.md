I used a new colorization technique, restored and applied face restoration, and created a sound design for this video of New York in 1910. The footage offers a vibrant tour of the city, featuring landmarks like Times Square, Grant's Tomb, Central Park, and Luna Park. Visitors can be seen taking sight-seeing cars, feeding pigeons, and enjoying the park's rides, capturing the charm and energy of the era.

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
