<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heyy, so before you start joking i have to say im new to mobile developing and this is a honest question.</p> <p>I have only developed 2 apps both in react native. I mostly picked that because i have experience with react so i thought it would be easier for me to start. But i felt like on these apps I had a lot of limitations. I dont know if its normal or because its not the best way to do it.</p> <p>Basically im here to ask your opinion on strongs of each aproach, keeping in mind I would prefer to develop a app for both android and iOs.</p> <p>Thankss &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RodrigoGraca"> /u/RodrigoGraca </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/flutter-vs-swift">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1i0414u/flutter_swift_or_react_native_for_mobile/">[comments]</a></span>
