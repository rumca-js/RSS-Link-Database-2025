Standing still for a while causes me pain in the heels that gets to a point where I have to stop playing after only like 1-2 hours and it doesn\u2019t get better until the next day. Btw I play on carpet so pretty much the softest thing I can. I have insoles for my shoes that really only help on hard floor. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar issue to me and if they have found a way to mitigate pain.

The Headset tracking on the CL is abysmal, and I will most likely be returning it. I come from a quest 2, I want something better than compressed image, maybe something that works with the base stations that ill be setting up with the knuckles? I have looked at the big screen beyond, but not too keen on being unable to share the headset due to the custom face cushion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/subsidemrfist\"> /u/subsidemrfist </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i0764y/what_headset_to_pair_with_valve_knuckles/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i0764y/what_headset_to_pair_with_valve_knuckles/\">[comments]</a></span>",

For reference, the only VR headset i have used was my friend&#39;s Quest 3S and it looked decent but it felt compressed and i could tell there was something lacking from the clarity (used standalone, not attached to a pc).
