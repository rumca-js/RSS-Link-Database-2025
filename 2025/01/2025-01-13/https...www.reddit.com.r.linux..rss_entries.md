<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It has been about a year since I first installed lubuntu and began to learn of the ways of tux. It has been long, but TOTALLY WORTH THE WORK. I don&#39;t need to reboot for every update, proton works for the most part, and I now love Linux for being easy to set up and understand (some of the time)</p> <p>Sure windows ran stuff out of the box, but Linux has deep customisation. Now, whenever I (actually) boot up stalker, the graphics don&#39;t snort crack. The graphics actually work. I can now actually install quake 2 from a USB, and NOT have to deal with compatibility crap.</p> <p>In short, I&#39;m glad I switched to Linux, so I don&#39;t get hacked on windows, and the things I do (usually) don&#39;t set on fire</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/slavloverX"> /u/slavloverX </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i027kd/it_has_been_about_a_year/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa
