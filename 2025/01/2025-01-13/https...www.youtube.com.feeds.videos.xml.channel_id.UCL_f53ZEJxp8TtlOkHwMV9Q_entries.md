Jordan Peterson sits down with philosopher, podcaster, and author Alex Epstein. They discuss the unprecedented need for energy to fuel the AI boom, the potential for abundant energy to outpace the problems it could create, the failure of the net-zero agenda, the necessity of a pro-human, pro-fossil fuel world, and the governmental policy ideas that would ensure an energy rich future.

Alex Epstein is a philosopher and energy expert who argues that "human flourishing" should be the guiding principle of energy and environmental progress. He is the author of the new bestselling book, “Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas—Not Less.” He is also the creator of EnergyTalkingPoints.com — a source of powerful, well-referenced talking points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.
