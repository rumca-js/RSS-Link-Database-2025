  <p id="we22Z3">TikTokers are coping with the app’s potential ban with an unusual trend: by bidding farewell to their “personal Chinese spy.” The trend, which pokes fun at security concerns surrounding the app, has users thanking their “spy” for surveilling them and filling their For You page with entertaining content, while others <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kozylifekiki/video/7459077362513235246">proclaim</a> that they’d rather share their data directly with the Chinese government than switch to Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts.</p>

  <p id="5bhcXO">Meta announced last week that it would be ditching fact-checkers in favor of X-like Community Notes, and self-described<strong> “</strong>leaker” Alessandro Paluzzi <a href="https://www.threads.net/@alex193a/post/DExryqXSehq">shared screenshots on Monday</a> showing what the feature might look like in Threads.</p>
<p id="VVGP0g">Based on the screenshots, it appears you’ll be able to start the process of writing a Community Note from the three-dots menu on a post, which is where you can already access features like muting an account or reporting a post. Another screenshot shows that when you write a Community Note, your note will be anonymous.</p>

  <p>As chief executive, Spence oversaw many successful products. But there was no coming back from last year’s app debacle: it has finally led to his ouster.</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lvXB6K">Sonos CEO Patrick Spence is resigning from the company today, effective immediately, with board member Tom Conrad filling the role of interim CEO. It’s the most dramatic development yet in an eight-month saga that has proven to be the most challenging time in Sonos’ history. </p>

  <p id="4LgNJR">Tom Conrad, a longtime veteran of the tech industry who joined Sonos’ board of directors in 2017, has been appointed interim CEO following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24106220">today’s ouster of Patrick Spence</a>. And in his first letter as the (temporary) new boss, Conrad hits on a number of things that will likely be music to the ears of rank-and-file Sonos employees. </p>
<p id="vCVWxy">“I’ve heard from many of you about your own frustrations about how far we’ve drifted from our shared ideals,” he says in the letter. “There’s a tremendous amount of work in front of us, including what I’m sure will be some very challenging moments, decisions, and tr
