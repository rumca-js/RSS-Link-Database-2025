<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>First Violin - References to RACE</strong></p> <p>The persons referred to can be found on Wikipedia. The dating of the word ‘racism’ is based on Google Ngram Viewer.</p> <p> In <em>First Violin</em> I frequently refer to ‘race’. ‘Race’ is one of today’s politically fraught words, and for good reason. But this was not the case during the period the novel is set.</p> <p>The word ‘racism’ emerged in the 1960s. We judge the past differently to how persons at the time referred to themselves.</p> <p>Jews referred to themselves as a ‘race’. For example, Primo Levi described himself as <em>“Italian citizen of the Jewish race”.</em> Stefan Zweig wrote of Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, that <em>“Theodore Herzl showed me the greatness of our race”</em>. Elsewhere he wrote that “<em>In viewing objectively the achievements of the Jews, one must reflect that no other race in history has so immersed itself in the aesthetic and confined itself to int

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are character names that I simply can’t take seriously. Lily Blossom Bloom, main character of <em>It Ends With Us</em> by Colleen Hoover, and a florist. It’s just too much. And there’s this book called <em>Powerless</em> by Lauren Roberts with a main character named Paedyn. I think Peyton would have also been a strange choice for a character in a fantasy novel, but at least it’s spelled normally. I don’t think adding the “ae” makes it feel any less like a suburban American teenager’s name.</p> <p>Obviously, everyone has different criteria for “good” and “bad” names, but some are just objectively strange. I’m sure there are plenty of examples. Which character names have thrown you off while reading? Does the wrong name break your immersion or otherwise prevent you from enjoying a book?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BrieflyBlue"> /u/BrieflyBlue </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not sure why I picked the book up in the library; oh yes I do, it was small, the guy&#39;s photo looked interesting, and it had a Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature stamp on the cover.</p> <p>Well I&#39;m glad I did. It was haunting and poetic and a bit confusing. Paris seems to be as much of a character in the novel as any of the people. And I don&#39;t usually go for novels that seem haunting or poetic; I&#39;m really more of a let&#39;s get the door open and three guys with guns in here kind of guy.</p> <p>But it&#39;s so smooth. Like butter, as they say. I&#39;m not that happy with the translation; I&#39;ve seen French translated in a more lively, less evocative fashion, and I like it better that way. Or I did in the past. </p> <p>The author spends a lot of time switching time periods and switching narrators, to the point where I wondered whether it would be worth it to just buy a copy, cut it up into pieces, and then just put the pieces in

But beyond these aspects, I absolutely loved the story.</p> <p>This is a simple story. A simple story of a passionate and committed man who loves something very deeply and would not let go of it until the very last. And a simple story of other simple people around him.</p> <p>I loved this book for Steinbeck&#39;s writing and detailed portrayal of what the farmers, animals and vegetation goes through during a drought.

It’s such a jarring stop start writing style to me. Clearly I’m in the minority because people love this book, it has 1.6m ratings on good reads and a 3.81 which is pretty high for the literary girlies.

Honestly, I feel the whole Earthseed a bit out of place. While I was reading I thought that it was just a way to introduce a non-confrontational religion, and oppose it to the actions of the Christian America followers. But then in the last chapters Earthseed becomes a powerful religion/organization, creating a king of happy ending that for me felt extremely rushed.</p> <p>It feels kind of magical.

Brilliant piece of literature from Lionel Shriver. The spine chilling moments, internal turmoils, unsettling exchanges, and leaden silences, all delivered in perfect pitch. The only issue I had initially was the vocabulary. Certain paragraphs read like someone pressed ctrl+A on the keyboard and applied thesaurus (English is not my first language, so this perception could be subjective). So I&#39;m curious. Was that intentional from the author? Using such complex vocabulary to convey the sophisticated nature of Eva? After a point, it did not bother me much because I was so invested in all the messed up things that were happening and the vocab was the least of my concerns or maybe I just got used to it. This is the only book I&#39;ve read of Lionel Shriver, and I really loved how she articulated several complex and sensitive to
