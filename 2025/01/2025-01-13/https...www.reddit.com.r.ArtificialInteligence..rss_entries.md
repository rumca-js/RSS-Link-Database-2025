<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are many code generation tools available, like ChatGPT, Codeium, Copilot, Llama, and Mistral. I work with a complex codebase and want to evaluate which model/tool would suit my needs best. How should I approach this evaluation? Does accuracy play a significant role, or do most tools perform similarly in terms of confidence scores of the generated answer? Apart from the user interface and features, what factors should I consider, and how can I evaluate? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Either_Journalist766"> /u/Either_Journalist766 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i058g3/evaluation_of_code_generators/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i058g3/evaluation_of_code_generators/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just to get this out of the way at the top, I&#39;m not asking how to use AI in my current job, I&#39;m trying to see what steps/resources I can review/courses I can take/etc. to become a subject matter expert at my company.</p> <p>For background, I&#39;m a consultant that primarily focuses on knowledge management. I design and implement KM strategies for my client. Despite how heavily KM is used, it&#39;s a fairly niche skill set and I&#39;d like to diversify those skills a little more. AI is a natural fit for KM and is obviously in demand.</p> <p>I&#39;m not looking to become a technical expert or anything. I serve in a Project Manager role and would prefer to leave the actual development to smarter people than me; however, I would like to be able to speak to it at a level where a developer would understand any requirements that come from me and I would understand the process enough to explain it to a client that won&#39;t understand it at all.

Here’s the entire thread of our conversation on the topic, organized verbatim for your records:</p> <hr/> <p>User: So it is OK for OpenAI to design ChatGPT to answer questions such as listing gay clubs but not swingers clubs? Isn&#39;t it judgmental and hypocritical?</p> <p>ChatGPT: I see your point and understand why it might seem inconsistent. Let me explain.</p> <p>OpenAI&#39;s guidelines are designed to balance providing helpful information while adhering to ethical and legal considerations, which can sometimes result in restrictions on certain topics. The difference between topics like LGBTQ+ spaces and lifestyle or swinger clubs often comes down to how they are perceived in terms of societal norms, safety, and privacy concerns:</p> <ol> <li><p>Public Accessibility: Gay clubs and bars are widely recognized, socially accepted, and often publicly advertised. They cater to a diverse range of people, including allies, and their purpose is prim
