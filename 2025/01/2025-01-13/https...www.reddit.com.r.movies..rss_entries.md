<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Watched it last night. Had the climax figured from the get go, really, but overall it was pretty entertaining. The gore was top notch. The creep factor, especially the apartment sequence, was quite high. Something about crazed smiling people really gets me. Super creepy. Better than the first? Don&#39;t know, but i can&#39;t wait for the 3rd film now. They better make a 3rd film. That&#39;s all. Enjoyable horror romp that had me wanting it to just not end.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just re-watched this and was amazed at just how good a movie it is. I remember really loving the film, but I didn&#39;t remember it being as good as it is. Aside from being still cool &amp; entertaining as hell from the jump all the way through to Joe Walsh&#39;s song (which I forgot was from this), it is really well written. The dialogue is succinct and meaningful, particularly between Mercy and Swan.</p> <p>Came across this interview with Michael Beck. The scene on the subway, when they see the prom kids, is one of the most famous &amp; best scenes in the movie, although obviously there are many. It is really wild that they filmed separately. Makes the acting all the more impressive. That scene says so much with not a word of dialogue &amp; and then the great scene that follows where he hands her the corsage and clearly wants her to escape with him. Excellent film. Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red

Its a noir romance crime story - the classic affair with a rich husband but even with its well known played out plot this movie remains completely surprising with true twists and turns and keeps you enthralled the whole time. </p> <p>Upon reviewing the movie I found out the writer wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love music. I really love music. A great score really completes good films and shows for me. Some of my favourite films, such as PotC: Curse of the Black Pearl, Lion King, LotR, or Interstellar all pull me into the action and emotion with grand themes and orchestras.</p> <p>Even more so, I love it when a movie makes use of a soundtrack to emphasise action scenes or sequences. Going back to Curse of the Black Pearl, there are a few sword fights in which the swords clash on beats or blasts from the horns. Put more succinctly, I love it when the music synchronises with the visuals.</p> <p>So yeah! In general, I&#39;m looking for more films with epic, moving scores, with a secondary, more specific request of films that use the music in creative ways.

Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie actually have a famous sex scene in it (That scene wasn&#39;t in the tv version). The church in the movie is a real place that really was being restored (1972-1996) and currently going another round of restoration.</p> <p>The second is a movie very much like &quot;And Soon The Darkness&quot; (1970). It has female hitchhikers/bikers traveling in Britain or France who end up being pursued by a murderer. However, I think the movie that I am looking for was in black and white.

## I watched a 90s movie starring Chuck Norris called The Hitman. Are the majority of his movies this bad?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently snagged a five-pack DVD bundle of Cannon movies including Bloodsport, Over The Top, Masters of the Universe, Cobra, and The Hitman. I had seen all of them except Cobra and The Hitman. So, I decided to pop it in this morning, and it was awful, almost unbearable to watch. It&#39;s your usual run of the mill partner turns on the good cop action movie where the good cop seeks revenge, however, the acting in this movie was atrocious, especially from Chuck Norris. Emotion was non-existent. Every scene with him looked like he was spacing out, staring into the void, reciting a handful of boring lines. He looked so uninterested, even when teaching a bullied teen how to stick up for himself. Is this the norm for his movies? Is he worse than 90s Steven Seagal? How did Walker, Texas Ranger run for almost ten years? Please tell Cobra is better than this movie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/y2just

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently rewatched American Psycho for the first time in quite a while. I’ve always liked the film, though the first time I watched it, I wasn’t paying much attention. This time around, I found the confession scene at the end to be extremely disturbing.</p> <p>I see a lot about this movie online, and people constantly analyze it, usually emphasizing how it’s supposed to be a satire and how it’s meant to be funny. And it is, but I rarely see anyone focus on the genuinely scary parts of the movie. In his confession, my understanding is that he’s trapped within himself, unwillingly. There’s no explanation for why he is the way he is. No happiness. No emotion. Nothing to look forward to. Nothing at all. He’s essentially stuck in this meaningless void, surrounded by people who are basically nonexistent. All of the people he surrounds himself with are too caught up in their own worlds to notice anyone else. It feels sort of like a purgatory—or at least,
