I looked up how to do that and found a reddit thread where someone recommended one calendar. I tried to add it and got the message that digest auth is not supported and to use basic. My question is which is better? basic or digest auth? I am not forwarding baikal to the internet as I feel it should stay internal to my network. I have a VPN that I keep active on my phone so my phone can still sync with it while I am out of the house. I am using a reverse proxy (Nginx Proxy Manager) internally for baikal to have SSL in my homelab network. So I am wondering should I use basic auth, digest auth or apache auth?</p> </div><!-- SC_O

Through my work I am getting 4 unused 6TB SAS SSD drives that I want to use for my storage.

If I can get these drives for free that will GREATLY reduce the cost of my new server, not to mention that they are al SSD drives.</p> <p>I know plugging a SAS drive into a SATA controller will not work even though the physical connector will fit. My question is if I use a case that has a backplane that the drives connect to, and I just connect that backplane to my SAS controller instead of the SATA controller on the motherboard, will that work? Are the connectors actually the same?</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterVertigo7"> /u/MisterVertigo7 </a> <br/> <span><a hre

I am not interested in the various complications of hosting my own publicly-facing email server, but I do want to archive all of my mail permanently and locally, so this setup more or less works for me. The problem is that I&#39;m limited to the one device, if I don&#39;t have access to my laptop then I don&#39;t have access to my email.</p> <p>I&#39;m envisioning some sort of middleman software. It would run on my home server, download email from the remote servers over POP, and then rehost it locally over something like IMAP that allows viewing and searching the entire archive from multiple clients. It would also need to accept and forward outgoing mail from these clients via SMTP, in order to archive it in a sent folder. Is there an existing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Curious, what is your network setup for Syncthing on all your devices? For example, if you have 1 phone, and several PC&#39;s that you want to have syncthing various things...</p> <p>1.) Do you use one PC (that is turned on and running the most consistently of all) as the central base. And every other device is only connected and syncing with that one PC?</p> <p>2.) Do you have one large Folder, containing subfolders, that gets synced to each other device? Or, do you sync each folder and have a different sync path for each individual folder?</p> <p>I know that probably the correct answer to this is &quot;it depends&quot; but... I&#39;m just curious what you all do? and if there are pros and cons to the different methods? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FalcoPwnch"> /u/FalcoPwnch </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i04eo4/syncthing_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m not sure if i can get help with this, but here it goes anyway. I have a home server for file transfer, and I also set up a Minecraft server running 24/7 for some friends to play. The server was running in a container using the image <code>itzg/minecraft-server</code>, and only the necessary port was exposed so my friends could join.</p> <p>At some point, an unknown individual accessed the server, always using the nickname of one of the players but with admin-level access on any account, something only I should have through the server configuration. Since it was always the same IP, I assumed it was just someone messing around and banned the IP.</p> <p>A few days later, another attack happened on a larger scale that destroyed the server. It seems that the person shared the server link on some popular Discord channel targeting servers for griefing, leading to another attack from a different IP.</p> <p>Basically, I’d like to know how I can

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. I&#39;m running into an issue that is beyond my present ability to troubleshoot, so I&#39;m hoping you can help me.</p> <h1>Summary of Issue</h1> <p>I am attempting to set up Nextcloud-AIO on a subdomain on my home server (<code>cloud.example.com</code>). The server is running several services via Docker, and I am already running Caddy as a reverse proxy (using the <a href="https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file">caddy-docker-proxy plugin</a>). Several other services are currently accessible via external URLs (<code>test1.example.com</code> is properly reverse-proxied).</p> <p>Caddy is running as its own container, listening on ports 80 and 443. That single container provides reverse proxying to all my other services. Because of that, I am reluctant to make changes to the Caddy network unless I know it won’t have deleterious effects on my other services. This also means, unless I’m mistaken, that I can’t also s
