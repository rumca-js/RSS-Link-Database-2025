I highly recommend it if you are looking for a two player cutthroat competitive game. </p> <p>There are dice in this game but don&#39;t let that scare you away, the core mechanic is I split you choose which leads to some tense decisions. &quot;How can I divide the dice in a way that my opponent won&#39;t pick the pile that I want&quot;. And then theres the reverse psychology of it: &quot;Its obvious my opponent wants me to pick this pile because of how good it is for me, but if I don&#39;t how bad will that hurt them?&quot;</p> <p>The game comes with a double sided map and double sided player board for different unlocks.</p> <p>It is also a roll &amp; write which I usually don&#39;t enjoy, but its merely the medium for how you put

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Recently, I have recently been on the hunt for adventure or dungeon-crawl-style board games that are not the traditional knights-and-wizards, strictly medieval European fantasy. Almost all were horror based with Napoleonic, Victorian or weird west settings.</p> <p>After playing Lands of Galzyr with its almost ‚Äúmusketeers-meet-anthropomorphic-animals‚Äù world, complete with guns, cannons, and unique storytelling/story saving method, it was refreshing to have early firearms and melee weapons alongside the usual magic and monsters.</p> <p>What are the community‚Äôs top choices for post medieval fantasy games? Magic, or otherworldly creatures while also featuring guns, pistols, rifles, cannons which are older than Steampunk or ‚Äúweird west‚Äù hybrids.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for all your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vinayplusj"> /u/Vinayplusj </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a weekly board game group, usually 4-7 people show up. We typically play one bigger game, about an hour long, then a few short games.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy everybody,</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for some suggestions on some co-op rpg and/or dungeon crawl style board games for my girlfriend and I to play. I prefer fantasy genre but open to anything good. Currently playing Descent 3E (the one with the app). I really enjoy the exploration aspect but the combat can sometimes be dull. </p> <p>I love Warhammer/Kill Team and the stupid amounts of die you get to throw, but my friends never want to play because of the rules and how long games takes. I love DnD character progression and the different types of die and modifiers, but don&#39;t have a schedule to play with a regular group.</p> <p>People tend to recommend Gloomhaven, I own Jaws of the Lion and I like it, but as stupid as it sounds, I like tossing dice lol. </p> <p>Thank you all for your time and suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vinnie2co"> /u/vinnie2co </a> <br/> <span><a href="https

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like a psycho, I saw and grabbed a good deal on fb marketplace for Spirit Island with all expansions (and deluxe tokens and 3d printed inserts). </p> <p>What&#39;s the best way to learn the game? Just the base game? Start with Horizons as it is meant to be easier/simpler? Should any of the expansions be thrown in straight away or wait until I&#39;ve got a good handle on the base game?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OldKingWhiter"> /u/OldKingWhiter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i7r5mw/best_way_to_learn_spirit_island_with_access_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i7r5mw/best_way_to_learn_spirit_island_with_access_to/">[comments]</a></span>
