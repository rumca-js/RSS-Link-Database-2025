<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I LOVE a series that develops over the course of several books, instead of each book having a different arc. So basically the plot over the series is always the same, just evolving (versus a different plot each book, the most common example I can think of is Harry Potter and Percy Jackson ig)</p> <p>I also love when it has romance that does the same, so the couple only gets anywhere like in the third book, yk?</p> <p>The best example of this I can think of isn’t fantasy, it’s just adult political fiction in a made up universe, and it’s the Captive Prince Trilogy. I guess you could also include The Cruel Prince trilogy (coincidence that the names are similar) but I’d say that one is YA.</p> <p>Bonus points it it features politics (both of my examples do) and a good romance (same thing).</p> <p>Sorry if this is too specific, thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/biaalmond"> /u/biaalmond </

I think George RR Martin is also good at this kind of grasp on human nature but Ursula was really ahead of her time.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently become aware of Nihei&#39;s new manga Tower Dungeon. I&#39;ve been aware awhile of a kind of trend/trope/coalescing sub-genre that this falls into and takes inspiration from other stories like Sword Art Online, where the setting is gamified, the characters are immersed in a structure or self-contained world, there are clearly delineated levels, etc.</p> <p>Often the self-contained world contains its own eco-systems, currencies, and other features. These tropes go way back, reminding me of a childhood favorite movie, Labyrinth.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t seen this talked about online but I may have missed. Was just wondering if there is a name for this trope/sub-genre yet, if it has been kind of recognized as a thing, and what other examples you might think of within this category.</p> <p>Edit: List of examples as they are mentioned/as I think of them:</p> <ul> <li>Tower Dungeon</li> <li>Sword Art Online</li> <li>Labyrinth</li> <li>Senlin

To be a TV writer, you <em>have</em> to live in LA. There&#39;s some (not much) leeway for screenwriters doing features, but for TV you legit have to live in LA in the vast majority of cases. This means the industry, for all its talk of diversity, only really accepts writers from one single nationality who live in one specific country in one specific city. This is why, to me, The Witcher felt like a high-budget LARP session. There is zero sense of culture, becaus

However, your cast are the regular fantasy crew doing regular fantasy stuff in THEIR opinion while they&#39;re discovering more of the lost civilisation and their &quot;magic&quot;. Basically, the cast has to be unaware that they&#39;re using tools.</p> <p>What I specifically liked about The Book of the Ice is understanding space as a black see that ships flow through, seeing AI as gods, robots as monsters, having their own names for technology and seeing it as magic but there&#39;s also magic of the world itself. And the entirety of understanding a race capable of space travel through the eyes of typical fantasy humans.</p> </div><!-- SC

## Looking for books/series based around Dungeons and Dragons lore with little to no romance!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there! I&#39;m a big D&amp;D fan (mainly for things like the lore, worldbuilding, the arcane pseudo-science etc etc) and I&#39;ve been really meaning to get back into reading, starting with fantasy stuff. I am looking for books and book series that are either based around the workings of Dungeons and Dragons or take great influence from that realm, such as using their classes, gods, spells, all that stuff. But a pretty big dealbreaker for me is prominent romance plotlines that consume the story when my main focus is the events, spells/fights, creatures, and characters. I know this is a huge thing in the fantasy genre for many compelling reasons, but it&#39;s just not my thing personally. I would be ok with it if it were limited to background characters or maybe even already established prior to the start of the book, but I&#39;m mostly interested in some kind of epic adventure. I am very new to the fantasy genre (for books!) so no answer is too &q

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I recently finished all 16 books in the Elderlings series by Robin Hobb. Prior to that, I’ve enjoyed a long and lustrous journey with fantasy, including Stormlight Archives by Sanderson. I admittedly struggled with Stormlight and felt out of place because it had so many amazing reviews. Flash forward to now: I’m reading Mistborn and I’m just not loving it. I don’t know if it’s BS’s writing (I admittedly prefer character vs plot-driven stories and loved how Elderlings felt like literary fiction juxtaposed on fantasy). I am once again feeling like I’m the problem because I’m not loving Mistborn and it’s so highly revered. I am afraid Hobb ruined me- but also could it just be Sanderson? Please give me your thoughts! Does anyone else struggle to live his work? I would also love book recommendations that are Hobb-esque because I’m still in Fitz &amp; The Fool mourning.</p> <p>TLDR; not loving Mistborn. Not sure if it’s a me thing or another series

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A half lifetime ago (1992) a friend and I were backpacking through Southeast Asia. I was reading a lot on that trip and could only take so many books so I would read one and drop it at the hostel we were staying at and take one of whatever was there. I picked up an Anne McCaffray book which turned out to be sci-fi, not fantasy (Pern). (I’m relatively certain it was a McCaffray book, but maybe I’m wrong).</p> <p>I read a few chapters but either lost the book, or abandoned it somewhere. The main things I remember about it was this girl, Terla, lived in a mega city a la Trantor/Coruscant with hundreds of layers. The metal used to build the layers was called “scrith”. Does anybody know what book that was? I’ve googled unsuccessfully on and off for years. </p> <p>Posting here because McCaffray’s audience is here. </p> <p>T.I.A.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yorlikyorlik"> /u/yorlikyorlik </a> <br/>

I’ve recently gotten back into reading books daily, and have been on a dark fantasy binge (other than horror, it’s my favorite genre). I finished The Blacktongue Thief in about a week and loved it, and am currently reading The Prince of Thorns, which I’m also very much enjoying and flying through.

I’m very enticed by how dark and inventive the Second Apocalypse sounds, I’m just wondering if it keeps you engaged the whole time or feels more like a struggle in parts (I have adhd and sometimes find myself rereading the same page over without processing it if the pacing is too slow).

I’ve found some real gems that way, and I’m back at it in 2025. </p> <p>This month, I’ll be looking at four magazines that are a bit under the radar in genre fiction. While one has its fair share of accolades as a publication, none of the four have ever had a story shortlisted for a Hugo Award. And it’s not for lack of quality—all four have published and continue to publish some excellent fiction. So this month, let’s take a look at <em>Mysterion</em>, <em>Metaphorosis</em>, <em>FIYAH</em>, and <em>Kaleidotrope</em>. </p> <h1>Mysterion </h1> <p><em>Mysterion</em> is a speculative magazine with a religious audience, focusing on stories with Christian themes or cosmology. But there’s a fair bit of variance among the individual stories as to whether they’re written explicitly for
