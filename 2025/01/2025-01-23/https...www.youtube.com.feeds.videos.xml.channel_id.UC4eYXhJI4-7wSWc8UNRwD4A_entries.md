The world of Portuguese fado is full of emotion that is on display within seconds of this performance by vocalist Carminho.

She came to her extraordinary talents by way of hard work, intuition and genetics, since her mom, the singer Teresa Siqueira, is considered one of the giants of her generation.

As she explains, some of the songs from this performance come from the EP Carminho at Electrical Audio, a recording she did with renowned American music engineer Steve Albini, who passed away last year before they could celebrate the success of their collaboration.

The performance is a front row seat to the joys and sorrows of the fado spirit, delivered by an artist that uses the genre as a base to explore other musical worlds, always coming back to a tradition that is centuries old.
