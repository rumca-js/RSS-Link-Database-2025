<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;m trying my best for privacy since a long time: Linux, CalyxOS on my Pixel, no Google apps, ProtonMail, uBlock, Adguard Home,... But I have seen a video telling that Google send all your notifications to goverments and it made me think on all the efforts I&#39;m doing to keep my privacy.</p> <p>What bothers me is that, as much as we try, when we send a message to other people who don&#39;t care for privacy, Gogole read this message (same for email). So we make a great effort and we get not so great reward due to others.</p> <p>I think the effort is not in vane because we reduce our exposure but with the AI and the political decisions against end to end encryption or the end of physical money (especially here in Europe) is going to be pointless eventually. The big brother is too powerful.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cullen__Bohannon"> /u/Cullen__Bohannon </a> <b
