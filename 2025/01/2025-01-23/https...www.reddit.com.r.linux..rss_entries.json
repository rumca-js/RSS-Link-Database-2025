By default PipeWire will now use MIDI 2.0 in UMP messages to transport MIDI in the graph, with conversions to/from legacy MIDI where required. This requires UMP support in the kernel.</li> <li>client-rt.conf is no longer supported. Custom changes made to this config should be moved to client.conf. Clients that try to load the client-rt.conf will emit a warning and be directed to client.conf automatically for backwards compatibility.</li> <li>The module-filter-chain code was moved to a new filter-graph plugin.

I&#39;m not a fan of guessing though, especially if it means I can brick my O.S.
