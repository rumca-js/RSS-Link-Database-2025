<p>AMD has confirmed a vulnerability in its processor lineup that leaked out early before the company had a chance to issue a patch. While the vulnerability appears to affect consumer Ryzen CPUs, AMD has yet to name them nor describe the vulnerability.</p>



<p>The vulnerability will require mitigations, however, AMD said. A security bulletin is due soon.</p>



<p>The Register <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/shopping/asus-lets-processor-security-fix-slip-out-early-amd-confirms-patch-in-progress/ar-AA1xHXVT">reported</a> that Tavis Ormandy, who works at Google’s Project Zero, had noted that Asus released a beta version of a BIOS update for its gaming motherboards with a mention of an AMD vulnerability. Ormandy edited his post to remove the reference, but not before the Register report was published.</p>

<p>Having a fast flash drive on hand can save you the pain of transferring files over slow Wi-Fi. In fact, it allows you to bypass the need for an internet connection altogether. It just so happens that one of our favorites — Samsung’s Type-C Flash Drive — is on sale right now, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Type-CTM-Transfers-Compatible-Waterproof/dp/B09WB2RPS4/">128GB model available for a mere $18 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>Besides the fact that this modern flash drive is a total steal at this price, this particular flash drive is awesome because, as the name suggests, it has a USB-C connection. That means it’s so easy to back up data from smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, and more.</p>



<p>The Samsung Type-C Flash Drive is tiny, too, making it easy to throw into a pocket or purse and take with you anywhere. It’s also built

<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1920726/1920726.html">Logitech teamed up with iFixit</a> to bring us the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/logitech-eu">Logitech Repair Hub</a>, an official resource of repair guides and spare parts for the company’s products. The hub first launched with support for just two items: the MX Master and MX Anywhere mice.</p>



<p>Today, the company has expanded the Logitech Repair Hub with many more products, now totaling 21 products. On top of the previous MX devices, there are now repair guides and spare parts for some G series mice, G series headsets, and the Zone Learn headset.</p>



<p>The idea behind the Logitech Repair Hub is to make it easier for users to repair their own products and make them last longer.</p>

<p>If you have a Chromebook, here’s an interesting development for you: Google is now making it possible to control ChromeOS using just your face, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24348966/google-chromeos-face-control-chromebooks-classroom-features-laptops">The Verge</a> reports.</p>

<p>Vivaldi has taken another slow step toward providing better sync options for users with the ability to push a tab to another device, plus a new weather widget in Vivaldi 7.1.</p>



<p>The update also adds new default search engines — Startpage, Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, and Qwant — as well as the options to adjust the background themes as well as the web widgets.</p>



<p>Many of us at PCWorld like Vivaldi, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/696762/6-reasons-to-quit-chrome-and-switch-to-vivaldi-browser.html">switched to it</a> a while back.

<p>Good lord, PC games are getting big. It’s not uncommon for a single AAA game to cross the 50GB threshold these days, which makes things kind of awkward when you don’t have a massive drive. Loading up <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> on a base model Steam Deck will eat up half the storage.</p>

<p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service is a great way to play PC games on platforms that can’t support them. But you can’t get all the bells and whistles of the PC gaming experience — mods are pretty hard to implement on those remote streaming machines.</p>



<p>Nvidia and developer Larian Studios have been working on it, though, and at least some <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> mods now work on the service. That’s according to a post on Nvidia’s official blog, which announced that “a range of curated mods” are available for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2083778/the-hardest-boss-fight-in-baldurs-gate-3-is-also-its-most-delightful.html">the smash-hit role playing game</a>, implemented through <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2450352/baldurs-gate-iii-adds-native-game-mods-on-pc.html">the official in-game system</a>.

<p>On January 21, a photo of an Nvidia GPU with code name GB202-200-A1 (see header image above) surfaced on the infamous <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2667355-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chip Hell forum</a>. The user who posted it claims that it’s a prototype of the most powerful GPU in the upcoming RTX 50 series.</p>



<p>The fully configured GPU allegedly utilizes the maximum possible number of computing units for which the chip was designed. We’re talking about an RTX 50-series chip that supports 192 streaming processors and an incredible 24,576 shader units. The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">current top model RTX 5090</a> has “only” 21,760 shader units.

What they <em>should</em> be talking about is laptop battery life!</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking for a lightweight productivity machine or a powerful gaming laptop, you shouldn’t have to settle for bad battery life. That’s never been more true than in 2025, as battery life and power consumption have dramatically improved over the last few years — to a degree, anyway. Not <em>all</em> laptops have good battery life.</p>
