<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately, I’ve been seeing more and more people turn to AI for therapy, and honestly, I’m starting to think it could be a good option for many. It’s an affordable alternative that provides a unique way to work through personal issues, especially if traditional therapy feels too expensive or intimidating.</p> <p>AI therapy offers a safe, judgment-free space where you can speak openly and without fear of stigma. For some, it’s easier to start with a non-human presence, which removes the vulnerability that comes with face-to-face therapy. And because it’s available 24/7, you can get help when you need it most, even if it’s in the middle of the night or when you can’t make it to a session.</p> <p>It’s also a great tool for self-reflection. AI doesn’t have its own biases or preconceived notions, so it can offer a fresh, non-judgmental perspective. Plus, it’s affordable—no expensive sessions or long waiting lists.</p> <p>I’m not saying it should replace trad
