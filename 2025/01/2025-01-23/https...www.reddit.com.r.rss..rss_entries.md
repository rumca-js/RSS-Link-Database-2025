<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fixing to set up a feed, but I have <em>no</em> idea what exactly a good reader is as I am a total newbie when it comes to RSS, and every search keeps giving me recommendations for crap like &quot;it can use AI to do such-and-such!&quot;, and I just want to be able to take a URL of the only feed I&#39;m particularly interested in, and plug it in, and have the feed as its own little bespoke thing.</p> <p>Taking recommendations for both Windows <em>and</em> Android. My only real caveat besides &quot;I want this to be lightweight and dumb as rocks&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m not looking at anything paid, since I&#39;m still entirely new to setting up RSS feeds in the first place&quot;.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Camwood7"> /u/Camwood7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i89lsm/whats_a_good_lightweight_rss_reader_if_i_just/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="
