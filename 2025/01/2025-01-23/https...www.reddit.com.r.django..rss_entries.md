<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;ll do my best to keep this succinct.</p> <p>Basically, I&#39;ve built a personal project with Django (ofcourse) and it currently has a basic html/css front end.</p> <p>I really want to create a mobile app/front end (android fan here) that makes use of the existing back end/will consume my API and I&#39;m leaning towards JavaScript because I&#39;ve some familiarity/confidence with basic JS already.</p> <p>Accessing device API&#39;s for the likes of offline storage is important and something I&#39;m excited to learn.</p> <p>The reason I&#39;m asking this group is because it makes sense to hear from those might have done this before or been in a similar situation and hear how they got on. I&#39;ve read about different JS frameworks already and while they give some insight - real world experience would be a great influence.</p> <p>Edit: I forgot to specifically mention if there were recommendations for frameworks that perhaps were less verb

## Rotate refresh tokens in JWT

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. If anyone has worked with JWT tokens where rotate refresh tokens is set to True, can you please explain how rotation works?</p> <p>For example, below is my simple JWT settings. </p> <p>ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME&quot;: timedelta(minutes=5), &quot;REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME&quot;: timedelta(days=1), &quot;ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS&quot;: True, &quot;BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION&quot;: True. </p> <p>Hereâ€™s how I think it works:</p> <ol> <li>when the access token expires after 5 minutes, user requests a new access token using the refresh token (let&#39;s call it RT1) . </li> <li>Along with the access token, a new refresh token (RT2) is sent to the user. RT1 is invalidated/blacklisted.</li> <li>when again this new access token expires after 5 minutes, RT2 is used for requesting the new access token. </li> </ol> <p>I believe I have understood the process correctly so far.</p> <p>My question is, what is the validity of RT2? Is it 1 day from the time RT2 was issued or 1
