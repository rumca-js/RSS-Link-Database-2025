<p>When implementing authorization in ASP.NET Core, we can adopt a declarative or an imperative approach. In a declarative authorization, you would typically use the [Authorize] attribute to restrict access to the resource. However, there are certain use cases (such as document editing) where declarative authorization using the [Authorize] attribute is not up to the task. For example, you cannot use declarative or attribute-based authorization for document editing, because the evaluation of authorization must occur after the document is retrieved from the data store. </p>



<p>In such use cases, we need to use a custom authorization method, otherwise known as an imperative approach. In this artic

Easy because hyperscale providers such as Microsoft Azure are focused on ensuring that tenant compute environments are locked down and isolated from each other. Hard because those same provider policies make it difficult to deploy and use many of the tools we use to protect our applications.</h1>
