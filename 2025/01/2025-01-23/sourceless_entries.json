Lovely UI with accessibility, simplicity, and a dash of uniqueness that would make a designer drool? Oh yes. So far my only \u201ccomplaint\u201d is that I want more (trans) people on it! The world is rough for trans folks and it\u2019s nice to have a place just for us to exist without having to justify that. This is a good little app with a good little community.
