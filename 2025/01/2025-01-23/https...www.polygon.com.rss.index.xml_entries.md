<p class="has-text-align-none">With so many games available at our fingertips — or in our backlogs — it’s sometimes hard to know what game is worth our time. Figuring out where to spend our precious free time can feel daunting, especially with more things vying for our attention. And if you’re busy with jobs, families, or other obligations, that free time shrinks even more. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Polygon is here to help. Well, actually this week I’m here to help. During our weekly open thread, everyone is welcome to comment to ask for tailored game recommendations. Want a long game to tuck into during the winter? Or some way to test out a new genre y

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo’s latest re-release, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, began its journey on the Wii, got ported to the 3DS, and is now available on the Switch. It just released for Switch on Jan. 16, but you don’t need to pay the full $59.99 price for it. That’s because Woot has <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-1">knocked $10 off</a> — or $15 off if you’re a first-time shopper at the Amazon-owned retailer. At checkout, you can enter the code <strong>GAMERFIVE </strong>to receive the extra $5 discount, which is valid through Jan. 31, or earlier if its supply of games sells out. Even at $49.99, it’s nice to save on this

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">The notion that all the best horror is deeply rooted in reality is certainly debatable. After all, sometimes it’s the alienness of a horror movie that gives it power, forcing us to fit its strangeness into our everyday lives in order to better explain the mysteries of both. But if there’s any truth to the aphorism at all, then <em>Sleep</em>, one of last year’s most underrated horror movies and a new arrival on Hulu, seems like the perfect argument for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Sleep </em>follows a young couple just on the verge of having their first child. One night, Soo-jin (Jung Yu-mi) wakes up to find her husband, Hyeon-soo (the late Lee Sun-kyun), sitt

A little unstructured time between Christmas and New Year’s? Perfect for pushing a long game over the finish line. Unless, of course, you make the rookie mistake of going on Steam and seeing some random game you’ve never heard of before with a cute name and positive reviews. That’s how you go from (maybe) finishing an 80+ hour RPG to getting sucked into <em>Rocket Rats</em>, the perfect snack-sized game to get you going in 2025.</p>
