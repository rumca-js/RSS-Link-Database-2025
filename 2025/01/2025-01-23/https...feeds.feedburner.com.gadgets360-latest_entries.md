NASA’s InSight mission has provided seismic data shedding light on the Martian dichotomy, the split between Mars’ northern lowlands and southern highlands. Findings from the mantle’s seismic wave analysis suggest the split stems from ancient tectonic activity and magma dynamics, rather than asteroid impacts. Variations in crust thickness and mantle temperature align with the internal origins theory, though further research is needed to confirm. This discovery offers valuable insights into Mars' geological past.

A new dataset developed by Japanese researchers from the University of Tokyo provides valuable insights into Earth's upper atmosphere, specifically the mesosphere. Spanning 19 years, the data sheds light on phenomena like auroras, gravity waves, and their connection to space weather. The study, published in Progress in Earth and Planetary Science, aims to fill gaps in knowledge about the "ignorosphere," a region between the stratosphere and space. By modelling atmospheric dynamics up to an altitude of 110 kilometres, the dataset offers a more comprehensive understanding of how solar storms, atmospheric waves, and other space weather effects influence Earth's climate and ionosphere. Researchers also hope to resolve long-standing mysteries such as inter-hemispheric coupling and its impact on the atmosphere.
