In a declarative authorization, you would typically use the [Authorize] attribute to restrict access to the resource. However, there are certain use cases (such as document editing) where declarative authorization using the [Authorize] attribute is not up to the task. For example, you cannot use declarative or attribute-based authorization for document editing, because the evaluation of authorization must occur after the document is retrieved from the data store. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In such use cases, we need to use a custom authorization method, otherwise known as an imperative approach.
