Ollie Rathbone scored a fine opener from range before Lyndon Dykes just about claimed an equaliser thanks to a deflection to ensure a fair result to leave the teams third and first respectively.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/23/dykes-leveller-keeps-birmingham-on-track-at-wrexham-in-hollywood-derby">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London</strong> <br>The Georgian musician was at her compelling best in Brahms and Liszt in a recital that showcased intensity, flair and poise</p><p></p><p>To judge from the large and hugely enthusiastic audience for <a href="https://www.mariam-piano.com/">Mariam Batsashvili’s</a> Wigmore appearance, the Georgia-born pianist, who was a BBC New Generation artist in 2017-19 and is now in her early 30s, has already established a faithful following in London. At initial encounter the reason for all that enthusiasm is not immediately obvious; on the platform she seems a contained, almost austere figure, and similarly her playing has no unnecessary frills. But a pianist who is just as convincing in both Brahms and Liszt, the twin poles of late Romantic piano music, clearly has something special, and as her concert went on, the more compelling an artist Batsashvili seemed to be.</p><p>She began with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/14/haydn-whe

It’s obviously not the optimum storage facility, but it’s perfectly located for access while cooking. It’s also complete chaos. Heavy-bottomed jars are stacked up one atop the other in misshapen walls, invariably hiding the one you’re looking for. There are bags of dried, friable leaves and tubs of sticky-rimmed pastes. Some I use a lot. Others were bought for just one recipe, possibly written by a lovely chap called Yotam, and haven’t been touched since. Here is asafoetida, and fennel pollen. There’s sumac and sansho peppercorns, and tamarind paste looking like a biodegradable stunt double for crude oil.</p><p>My relationship with this cupboard has long been sharply divided. On the one hand, I despair that I can’t be an organised cook; one of those fragrant, well-groomed types who has an alphabetised spice

## The Merchant of Venice review – poisonous prejudice erupts with shocking speed in a show with tech-bro touches

<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh</strong><br>John Douglas Thompson is a commanding Shylock in a vision of an apparently benign city where tolerance buckles all too quickly </p><p>He likes a bit of a laugh, this Shylock. Played with cool authority by John Douglas Thompson in a suit that blends with the grey concrete of Riccardo Hernandez’s brutalist set, he is even-tempered and jovial. Whether he is a “villain with a smiling cheek”, as Antonio characterises him, is a moot point. His darker side lies just below the genial surface, not so much a character flaw as the product of an oppressive culture.</p><p>Take Antonio. Played by Alfredo Narciso, he comes across as sensitive, generous, maybe even soulful; the kind of good guy who would stump up 3,000 ducats for a friend even when his wealth is all at sea. His look – suit and T-shirt, white sneakers, no socks – has the air of tech-bro affluence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/23/the-merchant-of-venice-review-ro

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in the cinema, and I don’t mean that in a good way. The little fellow enjoyed it enormously – we devoured a half bucket of pick’n’mix and cheered at the spidey-dino – and then, right at the climax, decided he needed to go to the loo. We rushed out, did the thing as fast as a seven-year-old can, rushed back – and everyone was leaving. “It finished just after you left,” said a sympathetic fellow parent, as the cinema staff vacuumed up popcorn. “I think there’s going to be a sequel.”</p><p>Maybe I’m an idiot – I definitely still don’t understand how a multiverse works – but I sort of think this ought to be illegal, or at least a matter for trading standards. As far as I can remember, it was heavily implied that this was going to be a self-contained

<p>He repaired his car with Sellotape and kept his trousers up with rope. But Eric Tucker had a hidden life – painting drinkers, smokers and factory-workers without saccharine or sentiment. Now a book celebrates his extraordinary life</p><p>Perhaps nothing captures the many paradoxes of Eric Tucker’s extraordinary life more succinctly than his choice of bookmark for all the art history books he secretly devoured. “Betting slips,” reveals his nephew Joe Tucker, with a grin. “They were falling out of his art books when we found them. They were everywhere.”</p><p>To the outsider, and also to most of his close family, Tucker was more generally a man of the bookies than of books: a chap who liked a daily bet and a pint of bitter; an unskilled labourer who had tried his hand at gravedigging and boxing; an unassuming grafter who lived all his life with his mother in a council terrace in Warrington, Cheshire, trying to make ends meet. He Sellotaped his broken car window and sometimes made do

<p>Aside from legal challenges, those who didn’t vote for the man have little means of resisting – and are frankly still in shock</p><p>It is a strange effect of the second Trump presidency that, where Donald Trump and his allies know the ropes this time round and have grown in assertiveness, their opposition seems paralysed, rather than emboldened, by experience. After Trump’s inauguration in 2017, millions of people took to the streets. This week, a lot of Trump-haters in Washington simply skipped town for the inauguration weekend.

<p>Dug out of the vault for a 40th anniversary version of Private Dancer, this glossy rock track gains much-needed rawness from Turner</p><p>In a world where august artists’ back catalogues <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/21/investors-boost-musicians-wealth-with-back-catalogue-buys">have become big business</a>, the music industry has become impressively adept at convincing people to shell out for yet another version of albums they already own.

<p>The short, blazing life of Italian philosopher Pico della Mirandola</p><p>Of all the great intellectuals of the Renaissance, Pico della Mirandola is surely the most personally captivating. “He wins one on,” as the Victorian essayist Walter Pater put it, his life having “some touch of sweetness in it”. An Italian aristocrat who dabbled in magic and escaped from prison after eloping with the wife of a Medici lord, his books were burned on the orders of the pope. Edward Wilson-Lee’s new biography brings us the events of Pico’s short, blazing life, but also what is most strange and attractive about him: the wonder of a&nbsp;scholar who felt himself on the verge of being able to commune with angels.</p><p>The basic facts are straightforward. Born in northern Italy in 1463, he was a&nbsp;child prodigy with astonishing powers of memory. (He is said to have been able to recite the whole of Dante’s Divine Comedy backwards.) The story of Pico’s education has something of the feel of a&nbsp;

Around the edges of the reactionary culture war nonsense were occasional good-faith attempts to grapple with how best to talk and think about these large, static objects that pepper what is left of the public realm. Lumps of stone and brass; often representational, often hagiographic, often stately, often decaying, and often deeply, unnervingly strange.</p><p>It is precisely this sense of strangeness – of statues hovering somewhere between architecture and painting, and between repose and movement – that animates the latest novel by the Irish artist and writer Adrian Duncan.

<p><strong>Holburne Museum, Bath</strong><br>This compact yet brilliant show looks at how painters responded to the subjugation of real life in the 1960s media age, with its explosion of photos, film and mass reproduction</p><p>When Peter Blake painted a portrait of his friend David Hockney in 1965, he based it on a photograph. Why? He got on with his fellow Royal College of Art graduate and could have got him to pose. In fact, their relationship was relaxed enough for Hockney to suggest Blake include the male youth in Austrian jacket and shorts who stands behind him – also taken from a photograph.</p><p>Hockney, with his round spectacles and bleached hair, looks right at us – or rather at a camera. Blake tries to capture in paint the photo’s harsh light and shadows, contrasting the secondhand, reproduced, even two-dimensional figures of Hockney and the youth with a bunch of balloons that are given a shiny, robust three-dimensional force. By painting a photo of the artist, instead of
