## Brian De Palma's Blow Out (1981) is incredible and a true example of "they don't make 'em like they used to"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First off, what an incredibly beautiful and stylish film. The cinematography, heavy saturation and overuse (in a good way) of split diopter shots really pull you into this one. </p> <p>The script uses one of my favorite writing techniques, which is to show you glimpses of the wider story <span class="md-spoiler-text">like the opposing politicians who ordered the expose on McRyan, Burke&#39;s meetings with them (the very concept of a meeting with a pro-assassin is hilarious), Jack&#39;s backstory with the cops, how the death is impacting the presidential race, Manny &amp; Sally&#39;s schemes and so on</span>, but never letting you get distracted from the fact that <em>this</em> is the main storyline. It makes the world of the movie feel so real.</p> <p>Also, and I said this in the past about Serpico (1973), I love how grimy and &quot;un-movie-like&quot; the setting is. Manny&#39;s apartment, the train station, the streets, everything is very much as-i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Say what you want about the movie or Polanski, but I watch a lot of film and realized that the scene when Brody’s character plays for the German officer is one of my favorite scenes ever. It is incredible. The way the lighting switches from illuminating the Germans face to the face of Brody as he plays Chopin perfectly, and the face of the German realizing how he has been part of a force that has possibly taken away talent such as this. You see him realize the horror of the Nazi regime as the song plays. I just came here to say that I always loved that scene but the recent rewatch cements that as an all timer for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/airmen5"> /u/airmen5 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8axgy/the_pianist_rewatched_recently_and_realized/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8axgy/the_pianist_rewatched_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some movies affect you so deeply that you can’t deny how powerful they are, even if you know they’re not for everyone. Maybe they’re emotionally draining, uncomfortably dark, painfully slow, or so abstract and experimental that most people wouldn’t connect with them. These are the kinds of films that stay with you for days—sometimes even weeks—but you wouldn’t call watching them an easy experience. </p> <p>For me, one of those movies is Synecdoche, New York. Charlie Kaufman created something that’s so layered and thought-provoking, exploring life, death, creativity, and regret in a way that feels almost overwhelming. Every time I watch it, I notice something new, but I can’t recommend it casually. It’s heavy and deeply existential, the kind of film that leaves you emotionally drained. Honestly, I think most people wouldn’t want to feel that way after a movie, and I can’t blame them. </p> <p>Another one for me is Come and See. It’s one of the most int

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For one example, there&#39;s a lot of reasons to dislike the &quot;Twilight&quot; films (as well as the books), but what I find especially annoying is that not only does it focus on the least interesting characters of the story, but Stephanie Meyer also created all of these side characters with backstories that sound like they&#39;d make much better movies. In particular, there&#39;s the scene in &quot;Eclipse&quot; where Nikki Reed&#39;s Rosalie describes her backstory; she was gang-raped by her financee and his cronies and left for dead, was turned into a vampire to save her and then proceeded to go on a spree of vengeance against her attackers, leaving her financee for last. Frankly, a vampire mix of &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot; sounds a lot more interesting to watch than anything around Bella, Edward or Jacob.</p> <p>Your example?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was watching the finale to Lost the other day and was reminded on the movie trope where the main character is deep into the villains lair or in the center of some massive machine fighting to restore the balance between light and dark. There might be one supporting character joining along for the ride, but the rest is usually off fighting a horde elsewhere.</p> <p>So many movies do this, but what is your favorite? Obviously Return of the King takes the crown i’d say? Or maybe inception in a way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/F33DBACK__"> /u/F33DBACK__ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i859mv/best_movie_finale_where_main_character_heroically/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i859mv/best_movie_finale_where_main_character_heroically/">[comments]</a></span>

She had this spunk and comedic timing. I would have liked to have seen her develop outside of her usual quirky characters and if she tried dramas. But, it looks like she&#39;d rather stick with fashion.
