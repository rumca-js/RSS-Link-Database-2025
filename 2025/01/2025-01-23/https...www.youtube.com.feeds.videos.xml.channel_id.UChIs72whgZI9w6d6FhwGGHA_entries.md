The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPUs launch next week, but reviews can go up today. This benchmark and review of the RTX 5090 Founders Edition video card evaluates the gaming performance vs. the RTX 4090, RX 7900 XTX, RTX 3090 Ti & 3090, RTX 2080 Ti, and more. AMD has an RX 9070 and 9070 XT coming up, which will likely aim to compete in some capacity with NVIDIA's Blackwell RTX 5070 and/or 5070 Ti. For launch though, NVIDIA will ship the RTX 5080 and 5090 on the same day. These benchmarks look at rasterized gaming performance, ray tracing, power consumption and efficiency, thermal testing, acoustics, and Schlieren imaging of the 5090 Founders Edition cooler.

We have a ton more content coming up on this card, so check back regularly over the next few days and subscribe!
