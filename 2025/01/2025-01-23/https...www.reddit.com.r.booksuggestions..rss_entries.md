I recently started picking up reading again and started with the carpathians....I forgot how much I loved to read, and the story is okay... but it&#39;s not capturing me like a good book used to. To be fair, it was written in 1999...and I&#39;m sure it was great in it&#39;s day....but it&#39;s 2025.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’m guessing as the majority of us, I was a huge reader when I was younger. I read all the HP book, The Hunger Games, Divergent, and also some novels here and there.</p> <p>The thing is: my university major was very reading-heavy, and with social media and technology, I fell out of the habit and it’s been probably over 7 years since I read a full book. </p> <p>I got a kindle for Christmas in hopes of getting back into the habit of reading and so far, I tried reading The Handmaid’s Tale, but couldn’t get through it (love the show, the book was very boring to me). I am currently reading a book called Sapiens about the history of mankind.</p> <p>I’ve tried searching for novels on kindle but all I see are romance novels with shirtless men on the cover and that is definitely not the type of book I’d want.</p> <p>So can anyone recommend novels or fiction books that are engaging and fun? I dont think I’d enjoy authors like Paulo Coelho or Colleen Hoover

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love sci-fi with romance. Not the 5/5 spicy, something like maze runner and the fifth wave. Or The 100 or The giver. I loved those sci-fi&#39;s! And the romance was perfect. Do you guys have any I can read that are like those?</p> <p>My kind of romance is kind of on the side of them starting off as rivals. If you guys have ever read any of those books you would probably understand. Maybe not The giver all to much but still. Also, Im not the biggest fan of on of the love interests dying. That just doesn’t go up my alley. </p> <p>I love novels, if the book is too good I would rather read novels. And if the love interest had a lover before their main interest, I’m okay with that too! But nothing cheesy. I tried reading Matched or Evermore (which were more fantasy and full on romance) but they were just too cheesy and predictable. </p> <p>So if you guys have any suggestions, I’m all ears. I’m dying for a good sci-fi book with a side of romance. </p> <p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry for typos, a bit sleep deprived. To make it clear, I need something with a discreet cover because I often read in public. I&#39;m looking for any good fantasy romance books that also have some plot, and it can be any type of relationship (MLM, WLW, MLW, anything!!). The only thing I ask is that I&#39;m not a big fan of &quot;rough&quot; romance. I would prefer for it to be gentle if they ever get beyond kissing (I&#39;m okay with smut). Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sunny_Days_1017"> /u/Sunny_Days_1017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i7tpvh/book_reccomendations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i7tpvh/book_reccomendations/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the past year I’ve read books like 101 Essays that will Change the way You Think, Stoicism by Jason Hemlock, a book on Game Theory, and Philosophy for the Masses by David Bruce. </p> <p>I’ve always wanted to get into reading fiction as a hobby and I’d love some recommendations. </p> <p>Months ago I picked up some Frieda McFadden books and cranked through Never Lie, The Housemaid, and The Inmate. </p> <p>I understand her writing style is controversial but I enjoyed the fast paced read and her ability to draw you in quickly. The thriller experience and twists and turns can be corny…nonetheless I found this entertaining and relaxing. </p> <p>What are some other authors and books you’d recommend for someone like me looking to enjoy that type of read? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_readingreddit"> /u/_readingreddit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i7tj

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My best friend&#39;s birthday is coming up and she is a book lover. I&#39;m making a blind date with a book gift for her. Every time I ask what book she wants she buys it soon after so I just want to surprise her with one. I know the covers of some of her books, but not the titles, unfortunately</p> <p>While we were out the other day she told me she was looking for books with dramatic twists or drama. She doesn&#39;t want a simple falling-in-love story. Some of the examples she gave were cheating, love triangles, attempted murder, major lies, etc. She likes both normal and supernatural romances. She&#39;d be okay with that if it&#39;s part of a series.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Usually_Tired_Ugh"> /u/Usually_Tired_Ugh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i7td6s/romance_with_drama_or_dramatic_twists/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently got back into reading and I thought hey a great place to start would be a series I would read sparingly in a bookstore when I was a kid. Could never buy one of the books so would sit in a corner of the store( was like books a million maybe it was) and guess where I left off and just read. I thought I found the series but as I read it I remembered more about it (made me very confused because I thought it was the same series big big big small brain). The series I found was the inheritance games. I was very wrong because this series came out in 2020 and the series I read was early 2000s prob around 2009-2010. The books were thinner and were about (I THINK THIS WAS AWHILE AGO AND NEVER GOT TO READ TOO MUCH) a group of people competing for a prize and solving riddles and games while traveling around the world. I wish I could remember more and it’s bugging me now that I can’t remember it after thinking I found it(very wrong lol feel dumb af). Th
