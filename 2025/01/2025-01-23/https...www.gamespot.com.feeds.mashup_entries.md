<p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages releases on May 15, Bethesda announced during a segment in today's Xbox Developer Direct showcase. The lengthy look at the upcoming prequel to Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal also showed much more detail about the weaponry, mission structure, and the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Calling this entry a "return to form," Bethesda said that it aimed to shift the feeling of Doom again. Whereas Doom Eternal wanted to make you fight like a fighter jet, Dark Ages makes you an iron tank who can stand your ground. That's thanks largely to the versatility of the new Shield Saw. This piece of equipment lets you block, parry, and attack, with each function complementing your array of firearms. And, Bethesda noted, this means strafing is a viable strategy again. There's also a revised Glory Kill that's more contextual and varied based on your weapons and the angle you're facing the enemy demons.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you'll be spending most of your time killing demons on foot

<p dir="ltr">People who are into games today generally know the term "walking sim." It seems to have cropped up around the time of Dear Esther in 2012, a first-person adventure game in which you explore the Scottish countryside on foot, triggering memories of your lost loved one. To be fair, the game <em>does</em> mostly involve walking around, but there was a time when calling a game a "walking sim" was meant by some as a dig against it. That was true of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dear-esther/">Dear Esther</a> and many games since then. One would use it to say, "This game lacks gameplay." To an extent, that's not the case anymore, as walking sim is now a genre label on Steam so fans of them can easily find more, and many games are built to attract an audience that enjoys this kind of game.</p><p dir="ltr">I like them, too, though I've always had something of an asterisk attached to my enjoyment. They didn't work as horror games, despite many attempts. I find this pairin

<p>Dark Horse has announced two new figures in its line of Mass Effect statues, as fans of the sci-fi series will soon be able to add Jack and Legion to their collection.

Jack is priced at $60 and is eight inches tall, while Legion is almost ten inches tall and will retail for $70.</p><p>Jack--the powerful biotic introduced in Mass Effect 2--is modeled after her appearance in Mass Effect 3 and her statue features all of her signature tattoos, updated hairstyle, and punk-rock jacket. As for Legion, the free-thinking Geth unit looks quite imposing thanks to its mechanical design and weapon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4432419-dark-horse-mass-effect.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432419" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a
