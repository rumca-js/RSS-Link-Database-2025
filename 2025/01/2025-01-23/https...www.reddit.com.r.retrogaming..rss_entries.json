My pre-schooler son always wants to play Thomas &amp; Friends for Sega Genisis. He\u2019s not allowed to play with mine if I\u2019m not around. So, I decided to mod a paw patrol arcade 1up jr cabinet so he can play it when ever he likes. Along with a bunch of other 8 bit and 16 bit and even some GBA games. He mostly likes the coloring part of the game. Fine with me. It sure saves a lot of mess and clean up. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",
