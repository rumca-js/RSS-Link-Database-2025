<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings all. I don&#39;t normally post at all but figured why not. I currently have a quest 3. And the default controller&#39;s stick drift is diabolical. Here&#39;s my question. Do I buy the valve index controllers for my quest 3? (Yes I have 2 lighthouses already for my trackers) or do I buy the quest pro controllers? I know the quest pro controllers will have sticker drift but I&#39;ve seen some products that is a dusk cover to (hopefully) prevent the stick drift (reviews did say it prevented it). Which is the better choice? </p> <p>For those who have the quest pro controllers, besides the stick drift (if you have it) is it worth upgrading/replacing? Thanks for the help y&#39;all.

I‚Äôm wondering if I should pull the trigger or not. I love games and movies, and knowing you can expand your viewing screen by so much for the latter excites me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, here&#39;s my idea : two cubes are placed in every corner of the room you play VR in (one on the ceiling and floor) which act as markers with specific coordinates. These coordinates would then be turned into a 3d graph with your headset as it&#39;s only data point which would be tracked in real time.</p> <p>Benefits : could make body/hand tracking a lot easier, you can play VR in the dark, safe zone in a room can be defined using more cubes</p> <p>Con : you need cubes</p> <p>Has anyone had this idea before?
