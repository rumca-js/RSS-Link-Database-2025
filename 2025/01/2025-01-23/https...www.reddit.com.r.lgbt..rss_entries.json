I&#39;m at the point in my transition where i pass about 50% of the time, somepeople see me as a cis man and others as a masc lesbian, I was on t for a year but had to stop because I lost health insurance, and I haven&#39;t changed my name legally. I&#39;ve been worried about all the anti-trans reterhic floating around since the election. Part of me wants to stay out and proud to show that nothing can stop us... but another part of me worries for my safety. I have been seriously considering going back in the closet and pretending to be a cis woman before things get &quot;Germany 1940&#39;s&quot; level crazy here. My straight cis sister thinks I&#39;m over reacting but I can help but wonder if this is where we&#39;re heading, and if it&#39;s just safer to hide until it&#39;s safe to come out",
