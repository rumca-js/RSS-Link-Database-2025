The company touted its major advantages \u2014 and now that <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/\">RTX 5090 reviews are live</a>, we can confirm that DLSS 4 indeed feels like black magic, supercharging frame rates and making games feel just as snappy as the beloved <em>Doom 2016</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because DLSS 4 now supports Multi Frame Generation (MFG), an AI-based multiple intermediate frame calculation that can artificially generate up to three images and insert them between two \u201creal\u201d frames, thus quadrupling the frame rate. Of course, this feature only works on new Blackwell-based RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But are the AI",
