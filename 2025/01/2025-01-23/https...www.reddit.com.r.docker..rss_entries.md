<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently started to use the remote context feature, allowing me to build my local project on a remote docker server via SSH. I played around with it, and from the way it behaved I assumed it automatically interpreted my Dockerfile to only upload files that are actually used via <code>COPY</code>, <code>ADD</code>, <code>--mount</code> etc.</p> <p>Then I started reading up on it, and it turns out that a lot of quite recent blog posts state the opposite, claiming that when building via <code>docker build .</code>, the whole local directory is included in the build context and transferred to the (remote) engine, so you need to manually prune it via <code>.dockerignore</code>. The Docker docs also sound like that, explaining that the build context is the local directory and includes all its files and directories, recursively.</p> <p>Confused, I did another test and added a large 6GB file to my local directory – the remote build (with <code>--no-

Normally i use sabnzbd to download media files, but sometimes the really difficult stuff to find is only available through torrents. Therefore I set up a docker container through Portainer that utilizing NordVPN protects qbitttorrent and prowlarr. Everything works as expected except there is no way for the Prowlarr app to connect to the normally bridged sabnzbd container.</p> <p>I am enclosing a copy of the configs from the appropriate containers as I am sure that I am missing something, other than duplicating containers for VPN and non-VPN arr functions.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RelativeAstronaut407"> /u/RelativeAstronaut407 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1i81vqm/trying_to_con

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I’m pretty new to learning Docker and I’m fooling around with making a website. So far it’s just been a static site, but I wanted to add a feature that requires a persistent database, so I have been using the postgresql official Docker image. This works completely fine when I run the app normally, but when I run the new built image, it’s not able to connect to the database. I’ve tried a bunch of things, and I can’t figure out how to allow the container to access the database, even though it works when run traditionally. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
