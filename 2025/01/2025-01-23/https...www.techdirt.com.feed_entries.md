Trump&#8217;s first administration was jam packed with the rubber stamping of plenty of terrible mergers. Streaming, media, and telecom companies are very [&#8230;]

The government&#8217;s next-best argument (after &#8220;Third Party Doctrine yo!&#8221;) in support of its bulk collection of US persons&#8217; phone metadata via the (now partly-dead) Section 215 surveillance program was this: hey, it&#8217;s just metadata.
