<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Learning Cybersecurity, I have found a lot of tools that are available outside to be learned or in books. However, I have been taught that maybe in real life, only a few of these tools are actually used. Thus, I must not learn all the tools and codes to be proficient in Cybersecurity.</p> <p>That being said, what are your recommendations based solely on the tools or OS you use every day?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious_Boss2947"> /u/Illustrious_Boss2947 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i8f39l/what_are_the_everyday_os_or_tools_do_you_use_as/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i8f39l/what_are_the_everyday_os_or_tools_do_you_use_as/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m frankly baffled that there are not publicly available tools to get around this. One would think given that it is both from Google and affects everyone it would be.</p> <p>I mean I see a lot of tools that promise to do it, for a price. But I very much doubt that they are not either malware or just a scam.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ceriden"> /u/Ceriden </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i7ucsl/why_is_frp_seemingly_so_hard_to_bypass/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i7ucsl/why_is_frp_seemingly_so_hard_to_bypass/">[comments]</a></span>
