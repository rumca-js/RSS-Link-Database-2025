Back to Basics: Functional Programming and Monads in C++ - Jonathan Müller - CppCon 2024
---

Functional programming is a declarative way of writing programs by composing functions.
In many situations, this can lead to code that is easier to write and understand and less error-prone.
However, it requires a shift to a more functional mindset.
This talk gives an introduction to functional programming in C++ using the modern standard library.
We will cover algorithms using `std::ranges`, composable error handling with `std::optional` and `std::expected`, algebraic data types, and separating IO from computation.
In the end, we'll even cover the M-word.
