## What does Zorin add as a distro other than pre-installed gnome extensions and apps?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok i know this might be a really hot take, and i am a beginner so i might be stupid (most likely).</p> <p>However, things i firstly thought were features that were added by Zorin&#39;s developpers are apparently just some gnome extensions. Probably any other distro will be able to achieve the same UI with these extensions.</p> <p>So, does Zorin actually add more features that i don&#39;t know about (that are native to Zorin) or are most of the sub-distros (the ones that are based on larger ones like any Ubuntu-based distro or Arch-based distro) just bunch of pre-utilized Linux with little to no additional features? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mustafa_Shazlie"> /u/Mustafa_Shazlie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i881xz/what_does_zorin_add_as_a_distro_other_than/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i881xz/what_does_

## I am surprised none of the distros making a Linux OS have joined together to build a proper music player.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I understand in general computing is moving away from local storage and local libraries, and tons of people are happy using Spotify to listen to music - but some of us still collect our music on computers.

But the disconnect in there being no good music player on the Linux system is surprising! </p> <p>To be fair, there isn&#39;t multiple alternatives on Windows. For the most part everyone agrees MusicBee is the best. But I am just surprised there&#39;s never been a movement or a decision to replicate or port MusicBee natively to Linux.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a Google Pixel 4a, which I bought quite a few years ago. Over the time I&#39;ve had it, I have taken it apart twice: Once to replace a broken screen, and once to replace the battery and the USB-C port. I also run GrapheneOS on it. I&#39;ve been using this phone daily and I am quite happy with it.</p> <p>This is where the good story ends however. Today I woke up to the unfortunate notification that GrapheneOS reached end of life for the Google Pixel 4a. I am thinking of either continuing to use my phone, or convert it to a sole MP3 player and switch to a Fairphone. Either way, GrapheneOS is not supported and I need to look into alternatives.</p> <p>Now, a while ago I&#39;ve got myself a Thinkpad, on which I installed Arch (btw) and KDE Plasma. I am quite happy with my setup. And since I am confident in my Linux skills, I got the idea to just install Linux on my phone.</p> <p>After 5 minutes of googling I&#39;ve found that there exists Arc

The new metrics collector tracks detailed compression and memory usage statistics over time.</p> <p>The rationale is pretty simple: I hardcoded a &quot;3&quot; multiplier on my version of zramd because that&#39;s what my manual tests said zstd could compress to. I&#39;m not a fan of guessing though, especially if it means I can brick my O.S.
