We&#39;re a group of 10-12 guys between the ages of 30-25. </p> <p>Most of them play League of Legends, so I guess this will be the &quot;main&quot; game we&#39;ll play, but I&#39;m looking into other alternatives to avoid burnout.</p> <p>A few years ago we played Project Zomboid for a good while and it worked pretty well, so I think that this kind of games where you can host a server should be in the list.</p> <p>Also I know that a bunch of them play Age of Empires, so other titles like this could be a good addition because we could organize a small tournament or so.</p> <p>Could you recommend some games that you think would work well in a LAN party?
