With TikTok back in the spotlight, supposedly getting "saved" (by the same administration that championed its ban...) I wanted to look back at the road that led us to now celebrating the continuation of a destructive service, once rightly on track to be removed from public consumption.

Apparently now TikTok is fine, despite inflicting deep psychological damage, and being targeted across three separate administrations. Scoring cheap political points is clearly more important now than protecting the nation. The TikTok ban demonstrates with perfect clarity how dysfunctional the United States leadership has become.
