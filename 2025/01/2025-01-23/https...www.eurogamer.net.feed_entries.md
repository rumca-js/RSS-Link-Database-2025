First rumoured to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-infinity-is-a-live-service-platform-connecting-future-games">live-service Assassin's Creed</a> connecting games past and present, Ubisoft later said the project would act more like a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">hub-style platform</a> that groups those games together rather than a game in the more traditional sense. It's still a bit of an unknown, however, especially since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-assassins-creed-shadows-leak-showing-free-battle-pass-rewards">sudden rebrand</a> last summer.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eur

As part of my preview, I was able to get to grips with all sorts of new features and systems in the game, and chief among them was its customisable Hideout base. This is where dual protagonists Yasuke and Naoe will retreat to between missions, and on the surface it functions in a very similar way to Valhalla's homestead of Ravensthorpe.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-turned-my-assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-into-a-personal-cat-and-tanuki-sanctuary-human-allies-be-damned">Read more</a></p>

Having played around six hours of it at developer Ubisoft Quebec's offices last week, Shadows doesn't just look the part of a next-gen Assassin's Creed game, but everything - from its revamped combat, customisable base-building, and its effective use of having two very different protagonists to play as - all comes together to make this feel like a tangible step forward from what's come before. If you're a long-term fan of the series, don't worry - this is fundamentally

At $2000/&pound;1940, this is an extremely expensive proposition, but it makes some alluring promises in return: best-ever gaming performance from the GB202 GPU, 32GB of high-speed GDDR7 memory for games or content creation, and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation to max out almost any monitor's maximum refresh rate in supported games.
