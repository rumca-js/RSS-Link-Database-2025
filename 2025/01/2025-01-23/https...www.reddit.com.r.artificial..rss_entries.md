## Chinese propaganda accounts are blatantly spamming Reddit with Deepseek nonsense, and it’s happening here too. The truth is, it’s a censored model that isn’t nearly as good as o1.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been noticing these random, throwaway accounts popping up and pushing something called “Deepseek” all over Reddit lately. They talk about it like it’s the second coming of AI or something, but if you dig a bit deeper, it’s basically a closed-source, heavily censored tool that refuses to acknowledge anything remotely critical of China. It won’t even engage in a normal conversation about current events or human rights when it comes to China—it just skirts around the topic or flat-out censors it. And honestly, it’s nowhere near as good as o1 or other open solutions that at least try to address all kinds of questions.</p> <p>What really gets me is how these accounts act like Deepseek is shattering every benchmark with 99% accuracy, but then they never share any actual proof. It’s all their own “internal” tests, which magically confirm how amazing they claim the model is. No outside reviewers, no transparency, nothing. They want us to take their word
