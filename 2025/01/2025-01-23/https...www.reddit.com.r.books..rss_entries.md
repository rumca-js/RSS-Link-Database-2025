<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m conflicted about this book. I heard great things about it, i got it and yeah I liked it, it was fun. The more i think about it, though, the less I think it&#39;s a well written book. The things I want to discuss will be listed by number, so I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on my thoughts. you can reference the number to make it easy.</p> <p>1 - It&#39;s not a horror book, it&#39;s a love story tyring to be edgy. Yeah, there&#39;s some murder, but, to me, it didn&#39;t have &quot;horror.&quot; Detailing over the top murder doesn&#39;t make it horror. Setting it during Halloween doesn&#39;t make it horror either. </p> <p>2 - When asked what she did, she replies &quot;murders and executions.&quot; I thought &quot;oh, nice reference/nod to American Psycho. Later, Gideon uses the same reply. Then, she brings it home with &quot;hello Mr. Bateman.&quot; So, at first i thought this was a cool subtle refernce, then it became kind of heavy handed, an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>James Ellroy is a great American crime novelist.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read pretty much everything he has written. His early novels like Brown&#39;s Requiem and Killer on the Road are tight, standard LA crime novels.</p> <p>He really broke through with The Black Dahlia, a crime novel set during the pre-WWII struggles in LA - the Zoot Suit Riot opens the book. The conceptual basis for his later work is inherent here - EVERYONE is corrupt and corruptible. Mainly cops. Even the innocent have something to hide and there are no innocents here. (It&#39;s a realistic view of the world.)</p> <p>The Big Nowhere is the second novel in the loose LA Quartet series and a bleaker vision.</p> <p>LA Confidential, his most well-known book and basis for the Academy Award winning film, continues that grand vision with a few of the same characters and deeper and darker conspiracies. Brilliant writing - terse and hard. Ellroy doesn&#39;t pull punches. His characters live in th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just curious what my fellow readers opinions are on an author clearly breaking “out of character” and making a comment directly to the audience?</p> <p>For example saying “…(if you know you know)…” mid sentence. I just read a novel where the author referenced something super specific and then gave a quick thanks to the subreddit she got her intel from. </p> <p>Personally, it kind of breaks me out of the storyline a little. It doesn’t ruin a book (if it isn’t done excessively), but I wouldn’t say it’s my favorite thing. I’d much rather they put a reference number or asterisks and add it to the end of the page or the back of the book than just throw it into the middle of the prose. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/everybeateverybreath"> /u/everybeateverybreath </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i80op8/what_is_your_opinion_on_authors_breaking_the/">[link]</a></span> &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read It Can&#39;t Happen Here, by Sinclair Lewis, in 2023. Now, I&#39;m not from the USA, but my country, Brazil, had its alt-right experience. I know the book had a ressurgence during 2016 because of the first Trump election, but I read it because I was reading nobel prize winners at the time. It was a good book, if a little e exagerated. That said, since the last events, mainly Musk&#39;s nazi salute, It Can&#39;t Happen Here jumped to mind again, the story has more in commom with reality than ever. Seeing Trump and Musk together, on stage, remind me of the plot, and it fills me with dread. For those who didn&#39;t read the book, maybe you should give it a try, but only if you have the stomach now; it does make the future so, so bleak. For those who did read it, how do you feel about it?
