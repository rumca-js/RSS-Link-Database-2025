The cinematography, heavy saturation and overuse (in a good way) of split diopter shots really pull you into this one. </p> <p>The script uses one of my favorite writing techniques, which is to show you glimpses of the wider story <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">like the opposing politicians who ordered the expose on McRyan, Burke&#39;s meetings with them (the very concept of a meeting with a pro-assassin is hilarious), Jack&#39;s backstory with the cops, how the death is impacting the presidential race, Manny &amp; Sally&#39;s schemes and so on</span>, but never letting you get distracted from the fact that <em>this</em> is the main storyline. It makes the world of the movie feel so real.</p> <p>Also, and I said this in the past about Serpico (1973), I love how grimy and &quot;un-movie-like&quot; the setting is.

It is incredible. The way the lighting switches from illuminating the Germans face to the face of Brody as he plays Chopin perfectly, and the face of the German realizing how he has been part of a force that has possibly taken away talent such as this. You see him realize the horror of the Nazi regime as the song plays.

Charlie Kaufman created something that\u2019s so layered and thought-provoking, exploring life, death, creativity, and regret in a way that feels almost overwhelming. Every time I watch it, I notice something new, but I can\u2019t recommend it casually. It\u2019s heavy and deeply existential, the kind of film that leaves you emotionally drained. Honestly, I think most people wouldn\u2019t want to feel that way after a movie, and I can\u2019t blame them. </p> <p>Another one for me is Come and See. It\u2019s one of the most int",

In particular, there&#39;s the scene in &quot;Eclipse&quot; where Nikki Reed&#39;s Rosalie describes her backstory; she was gang-raped by her financee and his cronies and left for dead, was turned into a vampire to save her and then proceeded to go on a spree of vengeance against her attackers, leaving her financee for last.

I get that Hollywood somehow messed her up, but she was just so good at acting. She had this spunk and comedic timing. I would have liked to have seen her develop outside of her usual quirky characters and if she tried dramas. But, it looks like she&#39;d rather stick with fashion. Just hopefully her mental health is a priority to her because she still doesn&#39;t look so good right now. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sudden-Message5234\"> /u/Sudden-Message5234 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i7rful/i_miss_amanda_bynes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i7rful/i_miss_amanda_bynes/\">[comments]</a></span>",
