I got my hands on NVIDIA's monster $2,000 RTX 5090 GPU and things got weird when we decided to build it into a Roboraptor case. Beyond the jokes though, this card is pushing some serious boundaries with DLSS 4 Super Resolution and Multi Frame Generation that took Cyberpunk 2077 from 32 FPS to a mind-bending 370 FPS. Whether that's worth two grand is another story, but the tech here is absolutely wild.
