<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey ya’ll!</p> <p>I am a teacher at a high school. I just got a bunch of Pi 4s that I’m going to use for projects in class. I can image them fine at home, but I would rather my students do it in class. Unfortunately something on our network is blocking it.</p> <p>I’m getting “Error downloading: schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: Unknown error (0x80092012) - The revocation function was unable to check revocation for the certificate. - Server 127.0.0.1”</p> <p>I have admin access on the computer running the imager, so that shouldn’t be the issue.</p> <p>I’ve checked through documentation, but I’m not seeing the flat out list saying “all these ports are required”.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions for the ports and network locations I need to share with IT so they can unblock it? I’m guessing there’s really a certificate issue, but that’ll be even harder for them to fix, haha.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b
