I’m trying to lower my stress levels and would like something to have on that I can glance at and listen to. No ASMR, please. For example, I’m a fan of the BBC/ruth Goodman videos where they repair medieval farms and buildings and live as if they were in that time, Townsends, also these videos of people in the countryside of the Caucasus like Dagestan I randomly found, just going about their daily routine in the countryside? etc. Not really video games or anything AI generated. </p> <p>I’d also prefer something without THAT much talking since I have a tendency to get easily irritated by YouTubers (the usual cadence bothers me). If there’s anything in French (but NOT with a quebecois accent) I’d also appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prestigious-Art-9758"> /u/Prestigious-Art-9758

Similarly, if I don&#39;t have the app open and tell Firestick something like &quot;YouTube - Lofi Beats&quot;, instead of opening directly on the search for my criteria, it now only opens on that login screen and I have to search again. </p> <p>I have tried turning the Firestick on and off, clearing cache/
