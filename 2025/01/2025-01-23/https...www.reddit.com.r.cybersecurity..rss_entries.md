It&#39;s been two years since I started my IT career, and I would love to be a cloud security engineer. I have been trying to pivot from my current role and have received a lot of rejections and fewer interviews. For the last two years, I&#39;ve been put on projects thrown at me (even talking with my manager), so I haven&#39;t been honing on the skills needed in Cloud sec; I did achieve multiple certifications but haven&#39;t done any personal projects. I am pursuing a WGU degree in cloud computing for personal reasons, so that&#39;s my main focus. I want to do a personal project (s) this year, but I have also picked up learning pen-testing on the side for hobby reasons. I am doing TryHackMe&#39;s red team path, and afterward, I want to do HackTheBox&#39;s pen-testing course, which is the question I wanted to ask. Did anyone ever take these certificatio

Obviously it&#39;s my job to translate business requirements and risks into IT operational needs and codify such in our standards, but I have no authority (nor should I) to actually direct process changes. We have a a natural tension...which is perfect and expected, but it feels like they can&#39;t even handle the ITIL basics most of them time...I&#39;ll keep on reporting and doing my gig as the cyber guy, I have no operational responsibilities outside of leading IR basically, but has anyone else had this frustration? </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m an L1 SOC analyst, and I’ve been tasked with giving a presentation this month. I want to use this opportunity to get my team thinking beyond reporting and responding to pre-defined alerts. My core idea is to introduce the concept of threat hunting and how it can transform our SOC practices.</p> <p>The key topics I plan to cover are:</p> <ol> <li><p>Threat Hunting – What it is and why it’s important in a SOC.</p></li> <li><p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework – Using it as a guide to hunt for adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).</p></li> <li><p>Pyramid of Pain – Explaining why targeting behaviors (TTPs) is more effective than focusing on low-level indicators like hashes and IPs.</p></li> </ol> <p>I’d like to tie these together and show my team how we can use MITRE ATT&amp;CK and the Pyramid of Pain to structure our threat-hunting efforts and improve detection. The main points I’m thinking of:</p> <p>Using MITRE ATT&amp;CK to map threat ac

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently a CSIRT analyst working in France for a public institution and I think about relocating in SEA. But I don&#39;t know what can be the best approach/strategy to do it regarding my job. Should I specialize into pentesting and become freelance so that I can find some pentesting contracts with foreign companies and work remotely? But the competition on this freelance market seems really fierce. Should I specialize into a specific blue team role (DFIR, GRC...) and try to find a company willing to hire me in SEA, or let me work me remotely from SEA? I wonder about clearance and citizenship too because it&#39;s cyber... Where should I look? Where should I start? If some people did it your tips are very well welcomed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Warm-Smoke-3357"> /u/Warm-Smoke-3357 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i7sjhb/looking_for_the_best_
