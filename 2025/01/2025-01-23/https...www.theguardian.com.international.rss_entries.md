When the Women’s Ashes schedule was announced there was understandable criticism that it was far too short, with the whole thing squashed into a 24-day period. Now it feels too long. Australia retained the Ashes on the 10th day, which means the last fortnight of the series – containing two T20s and the Test in Melbourne – is one big anti-climax.</p><p>Still, this is the Ashes, and there’s always something to play for. Marsellus Wallace can say what he likes about pride but he clearly wasn’t a cricket fan. A number of the England players, and the coach Jon Lewis, are fighting for their future prospects. Australia’s future looks almost as bright as their coruscating recent past. The present

<p>When it gets going, the Netflix show is a pleasingly fraught watch about an Iranian mole, packed with risky missions and heroic acts. Breathtaking stuff</p><p>The Night Agent started life as a determined little underdog. Uncool, old-fashioned and on the wrong side of Netflix’s tendency to hype some shows while leaving others unloved, it had to fight its way into the streaming platform’s most-viewed section and critics’ best-of-2023 lists, which it did simply by being a sturdily constructed, twist-packed conspiracy thriller.

<p>We see untrammelled power with fawning courtiers. George Washington would have recognised the new system at the White House</p><p>Donald Trump’s triumphal return to the White House was American political theatre on steroids. This was, of course, exactly the returning president’s intention. “Shock and awe” was the en vogue phrase in the Trump camp to describe it, as the president sought to obliterate the Biden era in a blizzard of executive presidential orders and day-one Maga movement payoffs.</p><p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/">second inauguration</a> was exceptionally well worked. Where or whether it all lands in the form of delivered policy is a different issue. To some, it may feel petty to note that the last US “shock and awe” exercise – the Iraq invasion of 2003 – also generated a feast of indelible images of American power.
