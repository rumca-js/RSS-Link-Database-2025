<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just stumbled over BluerayNZB.</p> <p>This is what they state on their site:<br/> Our platform is new! We started this comparison on 20/12/2024. Here, you&#39;ll see we are the fastest in posting across all Usenet indexers. Pure scene, the fastest releases! Pay Attention: Sections we do is BLURAY, BLURAY-UHD &amp; TV-BLURAY only. If is scene release, we post!</p> <p>It seems that they emphasize on fast availability on Usenet.<br/> I did not check against others yet.</p> <p>Currently, only manual download is possible.<br/> They are working on RSS feed integration (SABnzbd / NZBget) and also on Radarr / Sonarr integration.</p> <p>If you want to check it out (I do not know if I am allowed to share full URL):<br/> www[dot]bluraynzb[dot]org/login[dot]php</p> <p>Maybe one of the mods wants to add this to the indexer wiki?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/usenet_information"> /u/usenet_information </a>

When I saw this my curiosity sparked again, like it did several times before. Just how big is the amount of data Highwinds stores to offer 6000+ days of Usenet retention? </p> <p>This time I got motivated enough to calculate it based on existing public data, and I want to share my calculations. As a site note: My last Uni Math Lessons are a few years in the past, and while I passed, I won&#39;t guarantee the accuracy of my calculations. Consider the numbers very rough app

## Why is nothing allowed in this forum anymore?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can not post anything to help anyone without getting my post removed. What is this forum for anymore? Everything I post to help someone I get this..</p> <p>&quot;This has been removed.</p> <p>&quot;Posts about Usenet-related software (e.g., edited to not get removed) are prohibited. Support requests, troubleshooting, and detailed discussions are not allowed.&quot;</p> <p>This does not align with the 6 Rules on the sidebar. I am legitimately asking why this Sub is even around anymore. We can not help anyone anymore. This is a Sub for Usenet, but we can not discuss it here. I get we can not talk about releases or point people to where to find things, but you all remove so many posts that do not break the 6 Rules. It&#39;s Usenet, we all know what we are using it for. This sub used to be a great place.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jericko"> /u/jericko </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddi
