This breakthrough, facilitated by an enhanced heating system, surpasses its previous record and marks a critical step towards sustainable fusion energy. Nuclear fusion aims to replicate the sun's energy production process, offering a potential clean energy solution. EAST's progress supports global fusion initiatives, including the ITER project, with hopes of achieving practical power generation in the coming decades.",

Variations in crust thickness and mantle temperature align with the internal origins theory, though further research is needed to confirm.

Spanning 19 years, the data sheds light on phenomena like auroras, gravity waves, and their connection to space weather. The study, published in Progress in Earth and Planetary Science, aims to fill gaps in knowledge about the \"ignorosphere,\" a region between the stratosphere and space. By modelling atmospheric dynamics up to an altitude of 110 kilometres, the dataset offers a more comprehensive understanding of how solar storms, atmospheric waves, and other space weather effects influence Earth's climate and ionosphere. Researchers also hope to resolve long-standing mysteries such as inter-hemispheric coupling and its impact on the atmosphere.",
