It\u2019s obviously not the optimum storage facility, but it\u2019s perfectly located for access while cooking. It\u2019s also complete chaos. Heavy-bottomed jars are stacked up one atop the other in misshapen walls, invariably hiding the one you\u2019re looking for. There are bags of dried, friable leaves and tubs of sticky-rimmed pastes. Some I use a lot. Others were bought for just one recipe, possibly written by a lovely chap called Yotam, and haven\u2019t been touched since. Here is asafoetida, and fennel pollen. There\u2019s sumac and sansho peppercorns, and tamarind paste looking like a biodegradable stunt double for crude oil.</p><p>My relationship with this cupboard has long been sharply divided.
