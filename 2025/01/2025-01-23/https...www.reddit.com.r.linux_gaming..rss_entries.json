I have a modern AMD CPU and GPU and I made sure Ubuntu is up to date and I checked for additional drivers. I even made a clean install to test and I am still getting this issue. It is occurring when playing Steam copies of both Balder&#39;s Gate III and Crusader Kings III. After playing for maybe 30 minutes, the games just get really laggy and clippy. Restarting the game temporarily fixes the issue, so maybe some sort of memory leak? I also tried turning my swappiness to 0 since I have 32 gigs or RAM, but this did not help. (For more context, I am running Steam from apt-get and I am using Proton Hotfix.)</p> <p>Does anyone have any tips?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jimbohostetler\"> /u/jimbohostetler </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i8b7bv/games_get",
