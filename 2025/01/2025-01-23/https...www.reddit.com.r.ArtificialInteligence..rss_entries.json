But I run a business in a space that is not particularly tech savvy and we have about 150 employees. I use chat gtp and bunch of other ai apps but I want to hire someone to build stuff that can benefit my companies or at least project manage the building of it. Thinking a chat bot employees can talk to for questions that&#39;s trained in company processes, etc, as well as AI to analyze data, help build AI for sales and marketing, etc</p> <p>This person needs to be able to help me analyze all the ways AI can help my businesses, and then help me get the apps, integrations, etc built and ultimately rolled out within the businesses. I would love any ideas on where to find a person with these skills and what role to post for etc, as well as what pay range is competitive.
