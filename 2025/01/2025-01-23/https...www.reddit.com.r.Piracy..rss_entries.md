<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the megathread, booflix is listed as a safe and/or preferable site. It redirects to wooflix now. Wooflix works, shockingly well actually, but it&#39;s riddled with overlays and aggressive/malicious ads. In terms of sketchiness and usability it&#39;s very low. </p> <p>But it almost never has any problems with buffering. I&#39;ll try a show or movie on there different sites and get the same lag and buffering on all three. But when I watch it on wooflix, it just works. Well, when it doesn&#39;t redirect me to google randomly. </p> <p>What&#39;s going on here? Do they have their own servers they host this stuff on? How is the streaming so solid compared to other sites? And why is it both the best and the worst at the same time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/betahax"> /u/betahax </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1i7spjb/wooflix/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h
