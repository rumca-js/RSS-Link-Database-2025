<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A websites domain registrar is public information that you can find out really easy if you just have the domain name. With this info we can see that they for example might use goddady.com. With this information we can craft a really custom email to suite this specific attack. Usually we will find the websites email just by looking in the footer or trying to find basic email usernames like <a href="mailto:info@website.com">info@website.com</a> etc. This usually works for more regular websites like hotels, Resturants, Salons, Just where the webadmin is a normal person. </p> <p>Social engineering is crucial, So for example you make a custom phishing email that says that they have an DMCA complaint that needs to be resolved otherwise if the email is not answered in 48 hours their domain will get suspended. We use services like <a href="http://Brevo.com">Brevo.com</a> to make the email reach their inbox. </p> <p>The phishing website we can make with chatg

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Most compromised accounts are not a result of bruteforce or hacking, Yes phishing is a huge part of it. But tools like leakpeak is a major one!. With leakpeak you can litteraly all the time find something if you provide an username, Email, Phone number, Heck even IP adress. I have a friend who uses it daily and its actually scary how much stuff can be connected just to 1 username, We are talking a bunch of emails, Passwords etc. And almost no email is protected. Even law enforcment use these kind of tools to find out more about an username or email. If a site doesnt have 2fa its game over. You can probably hack around 1/3 of all the users just by their nickname. Not promoting anything illegal, Use this tool for osint not for password finding.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eliasse123"> /u/eliasse123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1i2dvcz/osint_tool_
