        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I know that someone did a similar post earlier today but it was about the best movie theater experience that they had so I am doing one for the worst theater experience as of right now. Whether it had to do with the crowd, who you were with, the film itself, the theater, or another reason, there is occasionally a movie theater experience that goes bad or sometimes crazy. For me, it was Avengers: Endgame with the power outage and someone on the phone during the movie but I already talked about this a few times in the past.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative-Cake-833\"> /u/Alternative-Cake-833 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i2ey3w/what_was_your_worst_movie_theater_experience/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i2ey3w/what_was_your_worst_movie_theater_experience/\">[comments]</a></span>",
