        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, first post ever on reddit. I (24m) am a single dad with 1/2 custody of my 3 yr old. I have been out of my dad&#39;s house for 5 years but I have never lived by myself, I always lived with my (now ex) girlfriend. I recently moved back in with my parents while I get through this breakup and find a new apartment. I feel very empty on the days I don&#39;t have my son and the only thing that cheers me up is hanging out with my parent and especially my brother who still lives at home. My brother will be leaving for the army in 2 weeks and I will be moving out hopefully shortly after. I am horrified to live by myself especially now that my brother is leaving and I only have my son 3 or 4 days a week. I am asking this community for book recommendations to help with loneliness. Both literally speaking, like guides to live by yourself, and comfort books to keep me some company whenever I&#39;m by myself.</p> <p>Thanks to all who can help.</p> </di",

However I\u2019m a little tired of the historical fiction genre now and don\u2019t know where to go next. For me the writing style is more important than the subject. Other books I have liked were Circe and Piranesi. I prefer women authors but not 100% required. I\u2019m also trying to avoid media that\u2019s very dark or gory.

I know a murder mystery book would be one she might be most interested in but that genre isn\u2019t something I like.
