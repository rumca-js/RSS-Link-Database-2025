<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo has finally revealed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/449283/switch-2-announced-2025-release-date-price">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a successor to its wildly popular Switch. The new console has a few significant changes, including a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/509745/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-image">mysterious square-shaped button</a> and a second USB-C port. It’s bigger. It’s almost entirely black (very Microsoft-y of Nintendo to do this, by the way). But the weirdest part of the reveal video, in my opinion, is the implication that the Joy-Cons can be used as a mouse.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Angry Kirby was once an unlikely poster child for the difference between Japanese and American sensibilities. When home in Japan, Kirby’s joyful, round face was rarely seen <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2020/3/2/21158187/unraveled-the-truth-of-kirby">without a welcoming smile</a>. In the U.S., something was different: Kirby, the epitome of kawaii with a puffy pink marshmallow face, had a dangerous mean streak. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It began with an infamous 1994 print ad (embedded below) where Kirby posed for a mugshot: covered in bruises, eyes full of uncontrollable rage, cheeks covered in stubble. Then after a decade of altered but undeniably happy

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Nintendo Switch 2, the successor to the Nintendo Switch, is Nintendo’s upcoming console. Announced on Jan. 16, the upgraded console promises backward compatibility with Switch cartridges; a sleeker design with a new Joy-Con connection feature; and, most importantly, a release date within 2025. With hands-on previews starting in April 2025, there’s a lot to unpack about the new handheld. Dig in below.</p>

Today, Nintendo did reveal the Switch 2 with a new button on the right joycon… but not much more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The button doesn’t have a “C” labeling it like the previous controllers did. The video didn’t explain what the button does — rumor has it the button opens an in-game text or video chat system. Presuma
