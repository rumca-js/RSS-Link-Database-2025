<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As you may already know, things went down with Proton&#39;s CEO yesterday, so I&#39;m looking for alternatives to Proton Mail.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for good, yet cheap alternatives that ARE NOT Tuta or Posteo. The main reason I don&#39;t like Posteo is because they recycle email adresses, and the main reason I don&#39;t trust Tuta is because (when I was doing my research months ago, trying to degoogle before opting for Proton Mail) I&#39;ve seen that they sometimes delete accounts out of nowhere plus they had a really bad period of time where Tuta was DDoS attacked constantly and the mail was down for long periods of time.</p> <p>So, has Tuta become better than it used to? If not, what other alternatives do you recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xtsutsu"> /u/xtsutsu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1i2x14k/alternatives_for_mail/">[link]</a></span> &#3

## Why was the founder and CEO of Proton tweeting for Trump's approval?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Proton CEO <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/1i1zjgn/so_that_happened">tweeted</a> at Trump that Republicans stand for the little guys and not big business. If the selling point of Proton is that the governance is not financially motivated and is just a privacy focused Swiss non-profit, then why is the CEO desperately seeking Trump&#39;s approval around the time the new administration starts? What does he expect to gain from toadying to an external government entity? This wasn&#39;t addressed at all in their statement. Why did he tweet it and what pressure is the administration able to put on Proton? The statement was exaggerated to the point of being sycophantic, and he tagged Trump and used Proton&#39;s Twitter account to try to get his attention.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paesco"> /u/paesco </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1i2t3

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, there are many of these topics already but investigating each suggestion for the simple features I need is quite exhausting, so I&#39;m hoping to get some suggestions directly.</p> <p>I just need a cloud documents app to write and edit on my Windows PC and then access later on my Android phone. I don&#39;t care about collaboration, and I only need simple formatting options. My only requirements are that it has an Android app and has dark mode natively on every platform.</p> <p>The main reason I&#39;m moving away from Google Docs is simply because I have to use extensions for dark mode, they look bad and keep breaking. Many alternatives either don&#39;t have dark mode or don&#39;t have apps for both Android and Windows. Dropbox does but the interface is utterly awful.</p> <p>Many thanks for any suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/izlusion"> /u/izlusion </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About 2 years ago, at least for me, YouTube/Google changed the comments section so the &quot;Most Relevant&quot; comments went from the simple <em>most liked</em>, changing into a weird new algorithmically based selection.</p> <p>The &quot;Most Relevant&quot; comments can go from one with zero likes that is literally and intentionally totally irrelevant to the video, and the next one has 5000 likes.
