But after finishing my first squad of Legionaries, i know chaos trim is terrible work. I did the Legionaries with Black base, off-white zenital and it was painful. Will not do it on that one, thats for sure. </p> <p>So now i wonder what my options are? Paint it all black, give the armor parts a red (I&#39;m doing word bearers) drybrush and then paint the rest? Or prime it all in Red for the final armour colour and then paint the rest? Which would result in having to paint a lot of stuff black again, i think? Or even prime it all in silver and work with a lot of contrast? </p> <p>Any ideas are welcome. I prefer priming with a can but also can borrow a cheap airbrush from my club.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt
