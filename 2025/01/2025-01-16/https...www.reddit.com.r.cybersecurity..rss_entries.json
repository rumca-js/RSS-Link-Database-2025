The idea is that when you insert the USB into any device, it will boot up, ensuring your digital footprint is erased and providing a secure browsing environment, no matter where you use it.</p> <p>In addition, the system would allow you to store your passwords and credentials securely, similar to how browsers store them, but with the added benefit of being portable. Even if the USB drive is lost or damaged, there would be a backup mechanism in place, enabling you to recover your credentials from another secure location.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Most_Juggernaut7540\"> /u/Most_Juggernaut7540 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i2n92t/is_this_a_good_idea_for_cybersecurity/\">[link]</a></",
