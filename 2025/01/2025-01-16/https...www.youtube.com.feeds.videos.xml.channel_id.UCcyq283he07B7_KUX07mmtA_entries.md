Synthetic food dyes add a burst of color to many beloved American foods, such as candy, cereal, and even bacon. But some dyes — like Red No. 3 — have links to cancer, behavioral disorders, and other health issues.

Now, after more than 30 years, the FDA is banning Red No. 3 in cereals and other food products. The move comes as California is poised to ban synthetic dyes in schools and as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushes for a nationwide ban on artificial dyes.

But how did synthetic dyes take over America's food system in the first place? And how will the FDA's new policy change how food giants formulate their products? Health editor Mia de Graaf breaks it down.
