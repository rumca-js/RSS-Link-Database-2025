<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a raspberrypi zero w, one waveshare PM532 NFC Reader, and one waveshare WM8960 sound card. I need them both connected via I2C but only the soundcard works. I have got both working individually but when they are both connected, only the sound card works. I have confirmed that they have different addresses so, as far as I have learned, they should work on the same bus. Any guidance on how to get these working together?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Qlmmy"> /u/Qlmmy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1i2uxga/zero_w_with_two_i2c_devices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1i2uxga/zero_w_with_two_i2c_devices/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I have a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. It&#39;s already setup with OS Lite x64. I intended to run it headless though SSH and USB.</p> <p>I have added all the necessary lines to the configs:</p> <p>dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=peripheral (or without dr_mode) to the config and</p> <p>modules-load=dwc2,g_ether to cmdline. I have enabled SSH.</p> <p>I&#39;m testing this on two Windows 11 PCs - personal and laptop.</p> <p>When the Pi is connected through USB, it shows up as a COM device. I then install the RNDIS driver. This adds the Pi into network adapters as a gadget. The main issue is that when I go to network adapter settings, it says that &quot;Network cable unplugged&quot;. No matter what I do, I cannot create a connection to the Pi through USB. I can&#39;t ping the Pi at raspberrypi.local either (Bonjour is installed).<br/> I have tried reinstalling the OS and reconfiguring the SD probably a dozen times already. I have two Zero 2W&#39;s.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I&#39;ve enabled VNC on my Pi and installed Tiger VNC on my Mac. The connection seems ok in that I don&#39;t get an error message but all I&#39;m seeing is a blank grey screen. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried various methods to try and solve but none seem to work ie one site advises changing screen configuration via the Audi config command but I can&#39;t even see VNC display options on there. </p> <p>Does anyone have any advice please? Ideally I&#39;d like to be able to VNC direct from my Mac via screen sharing app but that doesn&#39;t even connect at all - I just get a message saying connection refused. </p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fast_Speaker8694"> /u/Fast_Speaker8694 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1i2nml3/help_re_vnc_from_macbook_to_headless_pi_5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. </p> <p>I have a Pi4, on which I run Homebridge (Bare metal) and Home Assistant + Scrypted in docker containers (managed with Portainer). I’ve being doing this for a few years, mainly for Homebridge, and all works well. However I’m no Pi/Linux expert so I muddle through following guides online etc. </p> <p>Anyhow, I recently bought a USB Bluetooth adapter, as I have a few BLE devices (Switchbot) and using the Pi’s own Bluetooth was unreliable and had poor range. The USB one has improved things and was automatically recognised by the Pi. </p> <p>I have two questions;</p> <p>1) Is there any value is disabling the onboard Bluetooth? I’m not sure how it works exactly in terms of which controller works when there is two. Can there be conflicts? bluetoothctl shows me both controllers and scanning shows all the dev is in my house, but I can’t see which controller is doing which. </p> <p>2) How to I disable just the Pi’s Bluetooth, leaving the USB do

I installed Raspberry Pi OS the first time with no issues. However, I was experimenting and decided I wanted a fresh OS install. I was trying to boot from a USB so I could wipe the partitions on the NVME drive and install fresh. The problem was I couldn&#39;t seem to hit the spacebar quick enough (so I could change the boot device) when the bootloader started because the NVME was too quick. So using `raspi-config` I changed the boot priority to network and disconnected ever
