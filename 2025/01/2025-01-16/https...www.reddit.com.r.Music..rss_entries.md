<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Who are some popular artists who were not raised or brought up playing/performing music and later in life got into the scene and grew to be big? What are their stories? I watched A Complete Unknown earlier this week in theaters and it got me thinking. Bob Dylan, and many artists like him, have roots in music, whether they began playing at a young age by teaching themselves, or if they were brought up classically trained/taking lessons. So, who are the artists that only got into playing music later in life either as young adults or older, and got big? What are their stories?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/youolddog"> /u/youolddog </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i2zgw9/popular_artists_who_got_into_music_later_in_life/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i2zgw9/popular_artists_who_got_into_music_later_in_life/">[comment

## I’m sick of knowing absolutely nothing about music

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I only just got into music. I especially like indie music and some soft rock, some pop and soft hip hop. </p> <p>But it’s just so frustrating to me how I barely know anything about my favourite music or anything about genres. The world of music is so overwhelming to me. My friends can name every song in an album and know when the album was released whereas I struggle to name 3 or 4 songs. How do people just know these things?</p> <p>My interactions about music with people always end the same way. </p> <p>“Have you listened to (insert artist)‘s album?”</p> <p>Me - “No, who’s that?”</p> <p>“What you don’t know who (insert artist) is?”</p> <p>It’s like everyone around me just assumes everyone knows these sorts of things.</p> <p>I guess what I’m wondering is how can I become better at understanding music. Does all that knowledge come with just listening to more music?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/
