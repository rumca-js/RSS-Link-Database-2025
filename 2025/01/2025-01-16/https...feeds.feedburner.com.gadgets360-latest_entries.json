Researchers suggest that nearly 30%-50% of these black holes could be concealed behind dense gas and dust, making them invisible to standard telescopes. The study, based on infrared observations, sheds light on how these entities influence star formation and galactic evolution. Jets emitted by these black holes are found to expel material needed for star birth, playing a critical role in shaping their host galaxies",

Evidence of private wealth, varied diets, and possible warfare challenges previous notions about ancient urban societies. The site may be the historically significant city of Qabra, referenced in Old Babylonian records. Continued research in 2025 aims to reveal more about this ancient city's identity and its place in history",

        "description": "NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of frozen sand dunes in Mars' northern hemisphere, revealing unique formations halted by carbon dioxide frost during winter. Unlike Earth's desert dunes, which shift with wind, these Martian dunes remain stationary until spring thaw releases their icy grip. Scientists study these features to understand whether Mars once had conditions suitable for liquid water, a key ingredient for life as we know it. Mars' axial tilt variations suggest significant shifts in seasonal patterns over millions of years, potentially impacting its habitability. Current research focuses on deciphering Mars' climatic history through frost cycles, aiming to uncover its past and present potential for microbial life",

Exposure to intense sunlight and micrometeoroid impacts likely caused the degradation of the flags. Although they may be brittle and faded, these flags remain powerful symbols of the achievements of the Apollo missions. Experts have speculated on the potential effects of prolonged exposure, including \"sun rot\" and the flags' eventual disintegration over time. The legacy of these historic symbols remains intact despite their physical state",
