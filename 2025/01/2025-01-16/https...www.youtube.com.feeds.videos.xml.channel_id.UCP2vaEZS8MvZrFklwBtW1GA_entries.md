Drywall repair tips‚Ä¶I have to remove an old towel bar. This leaves a hole in the wall. I use a drywall patch that has 3 inches of paper on all sides. I then use Easy Sand 45 to speed up the repair. I set a timer on my watch and that allows me to apply multiple coats in one day. Many thanks to @gshockus for sponsoring this tutorial and sharing my passion for craftsmanship üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è#drywall #drywallrepair #bathroomremodeling #gshock #brandpartner
