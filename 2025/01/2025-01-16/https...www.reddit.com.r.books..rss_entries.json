I had only read his short erotica comedy stuff and got the book when he came to my town on a tour. I finally got around to reading it and just had so much fun! It felt very personal/vulnerable, mysterious, unique, and all around just an awesome easyread book that touched on a lot of topics (it&#39;s about an LA horror script writer who begins having some strange horrific stuff happen to him, while also dealing with his childhood closeted trauma/coming out).</p> <p>Maybe it liked it so much because I had ZERO thoughts about it or expectations so it could only go up! But wondering if any other people have had that experience and if so what book did it for you.

I have read all the books in the Three Musketeers series and loved them, making Dumas my favourite author. But I certainly didn&#39;t expect any book of his to beat that series. Chicot the Jester unlike the first one is very paced, there is intrigue and plot twist in almost every chapter. Narrations of fight scenes is well done to the point that I could visualize it whilst reading. All in all a 5 star read for me. His books need to be more popular. In my local bookstore which holds many old books as well, there are many of Victor Hugo&#39;s books but only 2 of Dumas - Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers </p> <p>PS: I have read somewhere that Dumas didn&#39;t write entirety of some of his books. Honestly I have never wanted to look under that stone but I hope fervently this book is not one of them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

I know that the book is widely considered as the best Western in literature and I imagine that many people will still say it&#39;s worth reading, but I&#39;m not sure.
