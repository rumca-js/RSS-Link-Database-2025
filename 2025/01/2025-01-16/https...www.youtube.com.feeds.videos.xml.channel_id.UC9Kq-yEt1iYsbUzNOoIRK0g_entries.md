Despite the lifeless expressions of its main characters, the 2019 “Live-Action” Lion King remake made over 1.6 billion dollars at the box office, which means some kind of follow-up was inevitable. That obligatory follow-up is here, in the form of prequel centered around everyone’s favorite cloud lion: Mufasa.

Mufasa: The Lion King does raise some questions. Like why doesn’t Mufasa even try to get back to his parents. Wasn’t it established that Mufasa and Scar were actually brothers? Did we really need origin stories for a stick and a rock? Why do Timon and Pumbaa keep interrupting?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for Mufasa: The Lion King!
