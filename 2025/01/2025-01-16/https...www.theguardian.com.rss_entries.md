<p><strong>King’s Head theatre, London<br></strong>Cesca Echlin’s debut of three vignettes explores sadomasochistic dynamics, virtual romance and masturbatory pleasure</p><p>Some people leave “invisible marks on your body which only you know are there,” the narrator tells us. She is speaking about men she meets and to whom she gives a fantasy life, to give an erotic charge to her own existence. They “stride across your mental landscape” and you puff them up “like balloons”. You wish they weren’t so big, but they keep you company. There are so many elegant lines in <a href="https://www.cescaechlin.com/">Cesca Echlin</a>’s debut play, which was staged at the Edinburgh fringe in 2023.</p><p>Directed by Echlin, it comprises three vignettes about the erotic potential of solo fantasy and projection.

It will be out later in 2025.</p><p>The first Nintendo Switch debuted on 3 March 2017, and pioneered the hybrid console: it can be played both on the move, with its snap-on controllers, and at home, connected to a TV.

Each one had its own onomatopoeic name and in combination they evoked more a diagnostic toolkit for gastroenterologists than a set of musical instruments: there was the rumbler (or <em>rombatore</em>), the gurgler (<em>gorgogliatore</em>), and, most disturbingly of all, the howler (<em>ululatore</em>).

But 21 years after his last appearance for Union as a player, Baumgart made his home debut as head coach on Wednesday evening, and given the anticipation on all sides, this was probably even more deflating than Saturday’s comprehensive 2-0 away defeat. He had spoken about how he had never really had the Union job in his career plan as his feeling for the club would just make it mean too much. The 53-year-

These streets were in Zagreb, late one evening in the 1980s, well into Yugoslavia’s last decade. I was a teenager, being driven home from dinner somewhere by a friend of my mum’s, a chap in his 30s, which felt like an old and wise age to me at the time. His name was Radovan. As we crawled past the wielders of the hoses, he said something that struck me as unusual and rather sweet, the significance of which I’ve been mulling over ever since. Nodding approvingly at the street cleaners beavering away, he said words that roughly translate to: “Our boys are doing a good job here.”</p><p>Where I lived in the UK, neither then nor now could I imagine anyone saying something like that, unless perhaps they were in charge of street cleaning at the counci

<p>The British MC has amassed millions of streams for his careworn catalogue, recorded on a prison phone. Now, his new single addresses prisoners’ mental health</p><p>In November 2022, one year into an 11-year prison sentence for firearm charges, Birmingham rapper Marnz Malone was hanging out with his friends during “sosh”, or association time, on his wing. One of them, a boxer, was preaching the benefits of fitness training, explaining how he’d improvised an exercise using some equipment he had. Malone noticed the man living in the cell next to him showing a keen interest and asking questions. At the time, he thought little of it.</p><p>“We didn’t know that he’d just shown the man how to kill himself,” Malone says on a Skype call. “It traumatised so many of us.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/16/prison-is-not-a-place-for-rehabilitation-jailed-rapper-marnz-malone-on-confronting-inmate-suicide">Continue reading...</a>
