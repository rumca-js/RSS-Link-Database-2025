<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a friend that has the seamless 1.8.9 with codex version of ER with DLC. They are able to launch the game and get to the point of using the Tiny Great Pot. That is when they get the steam data gram relay error.<br/> How can they make it SEAMLESS co-op work at that point? They tried doing it offline but that generates the same issue and the point is to play in co-op.<br/> Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YeLlOw-SnOw3_14"> /u/YeLlOw-SnOw3_14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1i32idq/elden_ring_seamless_189/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1i32idq/elden_ring_seamless_189/">[comments]</a></span>

I AM sure its a 24H2 issue, How do i fix it, and its really hard for me to Roll back now because the deadline is up and i don&#39;t have means to backup my data anywhere for a clean windows installation.</p> <p>The exact problem I&#39;m facing is that the games just refuse to launch, When i click on the shortcut or the original exe file it doesn&#39;t do anything, appears in the task manager for a second and its gone, sometimes it doesn&#39;t even appear in the manager.</p> <p>Is anyone else facing it? I need a solution to this, i am going crazy almost every game I downloaded does this now since the update.</p> <p>I also noticed it seems to be a issue with Empress cracks.</p> <p>My laptop: Lenovo LOQ 14th Gen, i7
