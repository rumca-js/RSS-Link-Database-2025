## Mitoma and Rutter sink Ipswich to end Brighton’s barren Premier League run

<p>A first league win in nine for Brighton and the latest hard truth for Ipswich. The home side had been under little serious threat until Kaoru Mitoma, profiting from loose defending, scored just before the hour but were never in the game after that. They were smothered by visitors who chose to do anything but sit back on their lead, Georginio Rutter doubling the advantage and ensuring a swift return to the relegation zone for Kieran McKenna’s team. Brighton cruised home and, with players newly fit, will hope to have drawn breath for a march up the table.</p><p>The pre-match levels of respect between McKenna and Fabian Hürzeler had been considerable: two of the best young managers around oversee teams to be proud of, and there was another clear point in common. Both sides might wonder how their seasons would look if draws more regularly became victories; Brighton had tied six of their winless run while Ipswich, freshly out of the bottom three on goal difference, could point to the r

But if you haven’t, then I’ve got great news: the president-elect’s official portrait has now been released.

<p>The latest in the Like a Dragon series of Japanese crime drama is taking an improbably nautical turn – but its makers want you to know that it’s still got heart</p><p>In May last year, an anonymous forum poster shared details of what they claimed would be the next game in the Like a Dragon series, the Japanese gangster drama with a unique spirit of melodrama and ridiculousness. It would star the series’ most theatrical, violent villain, Goro “Mad Dog” Majima, as a pirate with amnesia, and it was called Project Madlantis. This leak went under the radar, quite possibly because it sounded so silly that nobody would believe it. But then, at 2024’s Tokyo Game Show in September, Sega surprised everyone by announcing exactly this. It is called Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. That’s it. That’s the game.</p><p>Madlantis sounds like a theme night at a noughties student bar, but is in fact the game’s pirate hub, a nautical Vegas where captains battle and bet on each other in coliseum face-offs.

<p>Jeans are a classic, but aren’t always the most comfortable thing to wear.

<p> It’s called a shared path for a reason, but a peaceful walkway can turn into something more like a racetrack      </p><p><br><br>
 My family recently moved house (still unpacking those last non-priority boxes) to a spot near a shared pedestrian/cyclist pathway and a few suburbs further from the CBD. We’re enjoying an easy hour’s walk most mornings. We pass wetland reserves full of bird calls and flowering trees and shrubs, eventually reaching the beach, and never needing to cross a road to get there.</p><p>However another wheeled threat can spoil the serenity – the subset of cyclists who fly past pedestrians as if the shared pathway is a velodrome. It’s especially alarming when a cycling group whoosh-whoosh-whooshes past <a href="https://bicyclensw.org.au/to-ring-or-not-to-ring/">with never a bell sounded beforehand</a> nor a slowing of speed.

<p>For a while I lost my sense of self and dressed in void-core black. Finally I’m finding myself again in a new, colour-filled wardrobe</p><p>First my dad died, followed by my gran, the resulting trauma forced me to quit my job, the love of my life left and before I knew it I was an only child who didn’t know who they were any more. All inside 18 months. I didn’t recognise the person who showed up at social gatherings, spoke for me or stared back from the mirror. That vanished person really enjoyed playfully dressing up but the new me only felt comfortable wearing black – an unconscious tonal shift to match life’s darkness.</p><p>As a kid I’d often be deep in my puppeteer mum’s dress-up box, and she gave me a small clothing allowance from an early age (which I’m sure she sacrificed her own needs to provide) that gave me autonomy over my image. I was the only boy in my high school sewing class and for a time I wanted to be a tailor. I’m straight but my choice of clothing became a tar

<p>This powerful debut plunges the reader into a raging battle between a young Afghan woman’s cultural identity and desire for freedom </p><p>Nila is the wild, rebellious daughter of Afghan doctors who fled their home before she was born and settled in a brutalist social housing block in Berlin. After 9/11, the family learned to lie (“To resent ourselves with precision”), to&nbsp;hide parts of themselves that seemed&nbsp;too much like “those people”; Muslims in a city where Nazis were alive and well. Then her mother died, and Nila began looking for a way out. Venturing out of her neighbourhood, she saw “people drinking mulled wine at Christmas markets, and between them, everywhere, there was a Mohammed or an Ali or an Aisha trying to get by”. And she hated them, “hated everyone who had the same fate as I did … I was ravaged by the hunger to ruin my life.”</p><p>Poet Aria Aber’s debut novel, Good Girl, follows the grieving Nila as she comes of age in the nightclubs of Berlin.

<p>A bracing conteporary account of the philosopher’s age-old prescription for living</p><p>I<strong> </strong>beseech you,” wrote Oliver Cromwell, in his letter to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, “in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.” Cromwell’s pungent entreaty is often cited in conversations about the importance of self‑enquiry and the perils of overconfidence. It’s an odd but telling choice, given that he was asking others to question their assumptions, while leaving his own unexamined. He had just purged parliament, overseen the execution of Charles I, and was in Scotland leading an army in a pre-emptive strike. Naturally, he wanted the Scottish forces massing for battle to think again. The obvious retort is: “No. You.”</p><p>This is one of several thorny problems philosopher Agnes Callard tackles in Open Socrates, an exploration of Socrates’ “substantive ethics of enquiry”; an approach to knowledge that, she argues, can’t merely be tos

<p>This acutely portrayed reckoning with contemporary Indian sociopolitics traces the faultlines of caste, class and religion</p><p>Devika Rege’s debut is not a definitive state-of-the-nation novel. Nor can it be characterised as the next “great Indian novel”, although it holds greatness within its pages. This chorus of the collective contains a multitude of ideologies and perspectives.</p><p>It is 2014, and the Bharat party – a thinly veiled version of the Hindu nationalist party, the BJP – is newly in power. It was a choice between “the weak governance” of the preceding ruling party, synonymous with decades of corruption, “and fascism”, and India has voted in favour of the rightwing party promising to clean the Ganga river, holy to the Hindu majority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/16/quarterlife-by-devika-rege-review-an-ambitious-debut-of-the-new-india">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beset by colonial controversy, difficult finances and the discovery of a thief on the inside, Britain’s No 1 museum is in deep trouble. Can it restore its reputation?</p><p>The British Museum is everybody’s idea of a museum, but at the same time, it is hardly like a museum at all. It is more like a little state. The rooms you visit on a day out are the least of it: the museum is not the contents of its display cases. It is an embassy, a university, a police station, a science lab, a customs house, a base for archaeological excavations, a place of asylum, a retail business, a publisher, a morgue, a detective agency. “We’re not a warehouse, [or] a mausoleum,” its chair, the UK’s former chancellor George Osborne, told guests at the museum’s annual trustees’ dinner in November. On the contrary, it is both these things, and others beside.</p><p>It is a sprawling, chaotic reflection of Britain’s psyche over 300 years: its voracious curiosity and cultural relativism; its pugnacious super
