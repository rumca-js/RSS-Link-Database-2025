<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just picked up a Toshiba MW20F52 to dip my toes into CRT gaming. I recently unboxed all my old systems and inventoried the games and wanted the old look and feeling. I know everybody searches out Sonys but so far so good on this; not too big or heavy either. DVD player works but haven’t tried out the VHS. I was told it was broken but we’ll see.</p> <p>I’m thinking of getting a rolling cart so I can move it out of the way when needed. Does anybody have a slick looking setup on something that rolls? Any recommendations?</p> <p>Can’t wait to try out the old SNES, N64, Gamecube, PS1, TurboDuo, Genesis, Dreamcast, Coleco, and Jaguar! Might be time to finally hunt down an NES.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dakutororu"> /u/dakutororu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i31ojj/toshiba_20_crt_mw20f52_and_cart_recommendations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="h

## Captain Novolin is a really bizarre way to educate people for its time

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I mean, I was just looking back at the game as I get that the point of the game was to teach young kids at the time about diabetes as the game “attempted” to be fun and educational and fun at the same time, but it backfired.</p> <p>But if I know why the game had failed, then why do I bring it up in here? I hear you ask, well simply because I was looking at the era of educational games from back then to see if they could have been good as again, I understand why games like Captain Novolin get heavily ridiculed, but it’s for that reason that I start to wonder if it’s possible to design a video game that is not only educational, but also fun to play as I found that game fascinating for its aforementioned failure status.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i2jd11/captain_novolin_is_a_really_bizar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LHi everyone, I’m trying to find a childhood game I’ve been searching for years without success. It’s not a famous game, but here are the key details I remember:</p> <p>It’s a 2.5D platformer for PC, released sometime between 1980 and 2005.</p> <p>The game has co-op mode (up to two players).</p> <p>The main character is a wizard/magician wearing a pointy hat and a cape. He’s flat, with a cartoonish appearance and pointy shoes.</p> <p>In single-player mode, the wizard is purple. In co-op, the second player’s wizard is pink.</p> <p>The setting is always indoors, likely inside a castle or dungeon. Each level feels like you&#39;re progressing upward (maybe floor by floor).</p> <p>The HUD shows hearts (health) and rings you collect from defeating enemies or exploring the map.</p> <p>The enemies and challenges include things like barrels, wasps, and metal spikes. I don’t recall puzzles, but it felt like an arcade-style game.</p> <p>I don’t remember much ab

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve all seen the state of reteo gaming. Old NES games going for $15 for even the non-first party games. OoT and Majora&#39;s Mask for $90+ at retro stores. Paying that premium for supposedly making sure the games are in working condition.</p> <p>The allure of having authentic versions of the games is very real and very valid. I can attest to this as I get excited when I go on ebay or FB Marketplace or local garage sales and spotting any games.</p> <p>But with how resellers scalp us to the point of absurdity, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if the future of retro gaming can&#39;t survive without Repoduction copies.</p> <p>I&#39;m very aware of the ethics of this. It&#39;s piracy. No way around that with this topic. But when I see Minish Cap for $20 on marketplace...and see how it&#39;s $80 on ebay...It certainly tests my ethics and what I&#39;m willing to pay on original hardware.</p> <p>The only console I don&#39;t see this working well is the Game
