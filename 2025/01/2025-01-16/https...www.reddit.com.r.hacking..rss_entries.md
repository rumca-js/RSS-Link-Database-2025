## How often do criminal hackers actually get traced, arrested & prosecuted?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read a lot of <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/">Dark Reading</a> and thus articles about data breaches, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/green-bay-packers-online-pro-shop-payment-skimmer">credit card skims</a> and so on. In addition, the consensus right now seems to be that almost all remote digital activity is traceable with the right tools. So it follows that petty criminal hackers (i.e. those who aren&#39;t hacking for a govt agency) will get traced and arrested.</p> <p>How often does this actually happen? Cause it seems to me that if it&#39;s such a high-risk crime people would rarely do it. Is it actually quite resource-intensive to trace and arrest hackers, is it actually quite common so resource is spread thin, or is it just a low priority for law enforcement (until a &quot;big target&quot; is hit)?</p> <p>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not hoping for a low answer and then changing career.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Checked some emails on haveibeenpwned and they showed up. Anyway I guess my question is if you&#39;re targeting someone why can&#39;t you go to HIBP lookup their email and then just get whatever leek they were a part of? Idk how hard it is to get these leeks though. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NewDogOldDog"> /u/NewDogOldDog </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i2kunu/can_someone_use_hibp_as_a_kinda_lookup/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i2kunu/can_someone_use_hibp_as_a_kinda_lookup/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Might be too much, I&#39;m just feeling hopeless. A friend is getting blackmailed by their ex. The ex already sent the images, videos, and fake stories to everyone my friend knows (including our neighbors and even the friends of their coworkers with no connection at all). We tried submitting to the police all the fake accounts, messages, emails. Basically got told that they can&#39;t do anything about it unless the criminal admits to it face to face. I&#39;m really feeling devastated about that. They won&#39;t even give any assistance to us. Maybe I can at least show that everything is coming from the same IP address? I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just desperate for anything that can be done about this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/florian_159"> /u/florian_159 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i2gv1o/is_it_possible_to_get_ip_address_from_messenger/">[link]</a></spa
