But his final address to America was last night, and be honest... part of you is going to miss him. Or, miss the fun had at his expense.</p><p>So, once more, for old-time's sake, here is Mumbles McGee stumbling his way through explaining why America needs to blow up the institution of the Supreme Court because his ideology isn't in control anymore.
