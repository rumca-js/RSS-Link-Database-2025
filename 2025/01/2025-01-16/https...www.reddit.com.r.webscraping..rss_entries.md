<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I have a python code that checks a http site I browse to using selinum. I use webdriver.Chrome and browse to a site using driver.get with a http url. For some reason it opens the chrome browser but changes the url to https, when I change the url in the search bar to http it works well but why can&#39;t selinum open the http site? Is there a work around to force it to use http?</p> <p>Note: for some http sites I check it is not happening and they work open with http.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IsraeliBoy69"> /u/IsraeliBoy69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i2pn4c/python_selenium_issue/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i2pn4c/python_selenium_issue/">[comments]</a></span>

I want to validate if it is expired, and if it is, then relogin, or load the saved cookies from the past. </p> <p>I have been trying to use PyJwt Python lib to decode the auth_token and fetch the &#39;exp&#39; attribute, but it needs a secret_key.
