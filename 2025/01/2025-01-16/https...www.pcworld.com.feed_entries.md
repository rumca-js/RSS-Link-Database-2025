<p>If you’re tired of laptops and large desktop towers, a mini PC is the solution for you. And right now, you can score a powerful configuration for not much money at all — the value here is crazy.</p>



<p>I’m talking about this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KAMRUI-Windows-Computer-Desktop-Supports/dp/B0DK6VVHDG/">Kamrui E3B mini PC for $280 on Amazon</a>, solidly discounted by 30 percent from its $400 MSRP. You’ll need Prime for this special price, but not a problem if you don’t have Prime because you can just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">sign up for a free 30-day trial</a> and still score the deal.</p>



<p>With an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U CPU and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, this mini PC is perfect for taking on all you need to do, from work tasks to media streaming and even some gaming. With the AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 integrated GPU, this thing can handl

<p>Obsbot has launched two new webcams today, with a feature you won’t often see: 100fps recording, for ultra-smooth video.</p>



<p>Obsbot launched the Tiny SE and the Meet SE, both 1080p webcams for less than $100. In fact, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OBSBOT-Meet-SE-Streaming-Grey/dp/B0DQ196WLW">Meet SE is $69 on Amazon</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OBSBOT-Tiny-SE-Microphone-Streaming/dp/B0DMF4GLR8">Tiny SE sells for $99 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, Obsbot is offering you a choice: The Meet SE perches upon your display or laptop like a traditional webcam, while the Tiny SE uses a pair of gimbals to track you around the room. Compared to the price of the $299 Tiny PTZ 4K — <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2013947/obsbot-tiny-2-4k-webcam-review.html">which I loved</a>, and is our pick for the best premium 4K webcam in ou

<p>If you’re on Windows 11, there’s a good chance you’re using BitLocker to protect your system files and personal data. BitLocker is enabled on most Windows 11 PCs by default, and that’s a good thing because <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2550614/windows-bitlocker-newbie-guide-why-you-need-it-how-to-set-it-up.html">BitLocker ensures only you can access your own data</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s a new BitLocker bug that throws up a cryptic error message when you try to adjust the settings, reports <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/01/16/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-bitlocker-bug-causes-settings-are-managed-by-administrator-error/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/01/16/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-bitlocker-bug-causes-settings-are-managed-by-administrator-error/">Windows Latest</a>.

<p>I’d almost stopped believing it’d happen, but the highly anticipated announcement has finally hit. Today, on January 16, 2025, Nintendo has officially announced the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The successor to the Nintendo Switch looks very similar but comes with a bigger display, upgraded internal hardware, and larger Joy-Cons that attach and detach magnetically (instead of sliding on rails).</p>



<p>Here’s the first-look trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2:</p>

<p>Matter may be the big new thing in the smart home arena, but the old Zigbee protocol still has some tricks up its sleeves, and this one’s pretty cool: The ability to transform Zigbee devices, such as Philips Hue lights, into motion sensors. </p>



<p>It’s called Ambient Sensing and apparently it works with a simple firmware upgrade and without additional hardware. Even better, all the motion sensing happens locally, no cloud required. </p>



<p>The news was teased Wednesday in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2beZO4xAUDw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube video posted by the Connectivity Standards Alliance</a>, the group that’s behind both the Zigbee and Matter protocols. </p>



<p>Ambient Sensing works with both new and existing Zigbee devices, according to the video, which demonstrates how Zigbee mesh networks can be divvied

<p>If you want to be adequately prepared for any emergency situation, you can’t overlook the importance of a portable power station, especially one that lasts a long time and supports all your vital devices.</p>



<p>Here’s a solid pick from Anker, one of our favorite power accessory brands. Right now, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Generator-Traveling-Emergencies/dp/B0D62P85ZR/">Anker Solix C200 power station is just about $100 on Amazon</a>, a whopping 41 percent off.

<p>More than a year has passed since <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2055373/asus-takes-over-intels-nuc-tiny-pc-business.html">Asus’ acquisition of the NUC brand</a> from Intel, which marked the first major change the brand had seen since Intel launched it back in 2013.</p>



<p>After more than a decade of continuity — including last year’s transition year where Intel still had a say on design — this will be the real first year in which Asus has done most of the groundwork, fronting up with its own designs and innovations. So how is the NUC different now in this new era? I spoke to Kuo Wei Chao, general manager of Asus IoT business unit, to find out.</p>

<p>DirecTV has made good on its plans to launch a sports and broadcast streaming package for less than its standard TV plans, but the savings aren’t enormous.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://streamtv.directv.com/mysports">DirecTV Stream MySports plan</a> costs $70 per month (with an extra $20 off for the first three months) and includes a mix of local broadcast channels, national sports networks, league-specific channels such as NFL Network, and access to ESPN+. This is uncharted territory for pay TV service, which typically requires paying for a big bundle of news, entertainment, and family programming just to access live sports (and vice versa).</p>



<p>Still, DirecTV’s new sports package is missing some major sources of sports—notably CBS and regional sports networks—and is not even available yet in every U.S. market. It can save money in some scenarios,
