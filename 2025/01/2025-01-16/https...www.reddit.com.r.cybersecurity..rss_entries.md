Im customizing an open source File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to flag files located in unauthorized or unexpected directories. The idea is when a security tool generates an alert it will read the file path on the alert only and flag the file if it’s in the wrong directory on the alert. Has anyone done something like this? What are the challenges? Are there better technologies to meet this objective?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Powerful_Film_9409"> /u/Powerful_Film_9409 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i2zyxb/file_integrity_monitoring_capability/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i2zyxb/file_integrity_monitoring_capability/">[comments]</a></span>

I&#39;m a noob, so I may not fully understand the intricacies here, but I wanted to put my thoughts out there and see if this idea already exists, isn’t feasible (because of costs, scalability, etc.), or simply hasn’t been implemented for good reason I hadn&#39;t considered.</p> <p>My thought is, why isn&#39;t there a master key (not related to KMS managed keys)? Managed/held by the bucket owner&#39;s CISO/security team? I know this means changing encryption from the whole bucket to the data itself. Essentially, each object could have its own key, encrypted so that there&#39;s a user key and a master key. But would allow for two/dual encryptions, one for the UMK and another for the MK. If the UMK was unavailable/compromised, MK (IAM) approval would be required.

The idea is that when you insert the USB into any device, it will boot up, ensuring your digital footprint is erased and providing a secure browsing environment, no matter where you use it.</p> <p>In addition, the system would allow you to store your passwords and credentials securely, similar to how browsers store them, but with the added benefit of being portable. Even if the USB drive is lost or damaged, there would be a backup mechanism in place, enabling you to recover your credentials from another secure location.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Most_Juggernaut7540"> /u/Most_Juggernaut7540 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1i2n92t/is_this_a_good_idea_for_cybersecurity/">[link]</a></
