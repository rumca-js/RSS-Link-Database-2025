<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I wanted to share a bit about the difficulties and issues transgender women face in Russia, maybe it will be interesting to someone:</p> <ol> <li>In general, transgender transitions have been banned here, and changing documents to reflect the correct gender marker is not possible. I am one of those who didn’t manage to change my documents 😔</li> <li>Discrimination is something we often face. I had to go through the military commission and prove that I can’t serve in the army. I can’t go to the gym because they either try to ignore me or don’t let me into the women’s locker room, but they also can’t let me into the men’s locker room. This is just a small part of everything.</li> <li>I often have to come out and face strange looks and judgment.</li> <li>Medicine is probably the hardest part. It’s very difficult to get help without facing issues and phobias. I have to go to private clinics almost blindly, but I’m thankful to those who remai

I have a 13 year old brother, and my siblings and I have always kind of suspected he might not be fully straight. My other siblings joke about it a lot, and I think it can hurt his self esteem. But they’re still young and don’t really understand why that kind of stuff can be harmful.</p> <p>I’ve always tried to support him and have open conversations about things like this in our family (i guess i was always preparing them). That said, he hasn’t told me anything yet, so I don’t know if he’s gay, bi, trans, or something else. He did say he’d let me know when he’s ready, and that’s totally up to him. I honestly don’t care what his sexuality is, I just want him to feel safe and supported. I also know that even though the rest of our family can be ignorant and make hurtful jokes, they will accept him once he comes out. I’ve asked them about it, and they’re not actually against it, they just don’

The final nail in the coffin was him telling me that he&#39;s definitely only attracted to girls or rather femme-presenting people. We&#39;ve decided to not pursue this connection any further and to just remain friends.</p> <p>On paper, this is great. We ended it before we actually started dating, I know a little more about what I am looking for in a partner and I don&#39;t have to wonder if me and him could have ever been a thing. I am also insanely proud for going after him (I was making the first move and being generally more open about my feelings). </p> <p>But on the other
