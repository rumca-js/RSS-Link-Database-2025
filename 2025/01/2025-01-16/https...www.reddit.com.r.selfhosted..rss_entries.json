My reverse proxy setup is Nginx, and I use a Cloudflare domain.</p> <p>Everything works fine in Brave browser, but when I try accessing my reverse-proxied sites on browsers like Safari or Zen Browser, the pages load as blank. No error messages or timeouts, just a blank screen.</p> <p>I&#39;ve ensured DNS and Cloudflare settings seem correct and SSL/TLS settings are active and valid.

I\u2019d like it to use SSL and be reachable with a domain like <code>homepage.domain.com</code>. In Cloudflare, I\u2019ve added the necessary DNS record and set it to &quot;DNS Only&quot; (proxying is turned off).</p> <p>The problem is that when I try accessing the domain via <a href=\"https://homepage.domain.com\"><code>https://homepage.domain.com</code></a>, it doesn\u2019t work. However, if I use <code>http://homepage.domain.com:port</code>, it works just fine.</p> <p>What am I missing, and how can I fix this?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently I decided to make my music collection available online. And at first I was looking at online storage services with ftp or webdav access. The price was around $60-80 per year. Not much, but it felt wrong to pay this money just for the storage service. I pay less for my email provider and I use it actively. Much more actively that I listen to my music.</p> <p>Anyway, in the end my choice was to have Raspberry Pi with 1TB SSD exposed online. And I did it using Apache + DDNS. Took me ~$200 and 3 evenings to put everything together and make it work.</p> <p>WebDAV was my choice for the sake of simplicity. My collection is organised and I dont need fancy UI or whatever, just having an access to it is enough.</p> <p>I had zero experience running a server and I&#39;m super happy with the result. I&#39;m happy to answer any question you might have if the topic is of interest.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
