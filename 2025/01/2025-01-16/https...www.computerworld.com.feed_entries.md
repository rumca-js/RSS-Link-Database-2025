<p>When you think about your smartphone, apps and interfaces are probably the first things that come to mind. Beneath all that surface-level stuff, though, our modern mobile devices are filled with files — folders upon folders of ’em! — just like the clunky ol’ computers we’ve relied upon for ages.</p>



<p>We may not come face to face with our phones’ file systems too often, but it’s valuable to know they’re there — and to know how they can work for us when the need arises. Whether you’re looking to dig up downloaded PDFs and presentations, open up ZIP files that a client emailed you, or move files from your phone to a computer, tablet, or even another Android phone or an iPhone, you’ve got all

<p>File management may not be the most <em>exciting </em>subject surrounding smartphone ownership — but if you use your device for productivity, my goodness, is it ever worth your while to chew over.</p>



<p>Your phone, after all, is your on-the-go connection to the world. It’s the always-available PC of our modern computing era. And whether your work involves presentations, PDFs, documents, or images, you’re bound to find yourself fumbling around with files on your pocket-sized screen sooner or later.</p>



<p>With the right tool for the job, though, managing files on your phone doesn’t <em>have </em>to be a hassle. Android’s got some outstanding file manager options, and best of all? You almo
