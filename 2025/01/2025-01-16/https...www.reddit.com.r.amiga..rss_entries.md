<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Iâ€™m new to Amigas, but I am very interested in the video toaster because I love old analog video and the effects and everything alongside it. I am interested in getting an amiga just for this.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just asked a seller if they would mind including the workbench disc they have used to demo a working A500 on eBay, their response was:</p> <p>&quot;we cannot include floppy disks because we can&#39;t guarantee that they don&#39;t contain personal data&quot;</p> <p>Has anyone else on this planet experienced this when dealing with ANYONE selling an Amiga.</p> <p>Please tell me this is an isolated incident and the seller just wanted to keep them for themselves, I can&#39;t bare to think of the alternative... or for that matter.. a reality where hackers are buying old amigas just for their floppy discs in an effort to extract and extort that juicy personal data... I mean, how desperate, low down the food chain, or lame would a hacker have to be in 2025 to resort to these tactics to get personal data, when the health services security fails are are enabling them to practically giving it away for free! ðŸ˜³</p> <p>This is a genuine question btw ðŸ™ˆ</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, i&#39;m a newbie here and to amiga emulation - I&#39;m using FS-UAE.</p> <p>Annoyingly I have ADF and LHC images for Arkanoid 2, but neither of these work. I don&#39;t have issues with any other games so i think the images might be bad. </p> <p>Does anyone have a working ROM of this game please?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drifter129"> /u/drifter129 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i2rput/arkanoid_2_rom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i2rput/arkanoid_2_rom/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;ve long been interested in Amiga, I love retro computers. At some point I&#39;d like to get an A500 or something to work with the actual hardware and get familiar with it, and as I&#39;ve seen in some posts here, plan to do some emulation to get familiar with the OS. Is there a version of Amiga workbench that&#39;s good to work with to get the definitive experience on an Amiga, especially that the A500 could run? </p> <p>I actually found this community while researching for a friend how to connect her 286 PC to her network using PLIP and found the plipbox which does just that for an Amiga. She actually has one for an Amiga she&#39;s working on, and we&#39;d like to find out if it can be used with a PC as well (while hopefully remaining compatible with the Amiga). If anyone has done this, I would like to hear, Thanks everyone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LazuliSkyy"> /u/LazuliSkyy <
