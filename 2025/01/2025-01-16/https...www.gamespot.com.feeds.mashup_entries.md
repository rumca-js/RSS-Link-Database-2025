<p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1601/16018044/4428694-switch2%2831%29.jpg" /><br /><h3><p>After months of leaks and speculation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Nintendo finally lifted the curtain on its Switch successor, the Switch 2</a>. Compared to its previous generations of game consoles, Nintendo appears to be building on the foundation of its wildly successful hybrid console with visual and technical tweaks to the system instead of launching a device that's wildly different from what came before.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions that'll need to be answered--and you'll have to wait until April for that Nintendo Direct--as we still don't know how much the Switch 2 will cost, its exact release date in 2025, or if the Switch 2 carts will be coated in a vile substance that'll encourage kids not to chew on them. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2

<p dir="ltr">Sony has had no problem remastering games for PS5, whether that's Demon's Souls at launch or even The Last of Us: Part II Remastered last year. However, Bloodborne continues to go untouched and still hasn't received a PC port. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida</a> has a theory about why that might be.</p><p dir="ltr">Appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes">the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, Yoshida admitted that he gets more questions about Bloodbourne on social media than almost any other game.

<p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida left the company recently, and he has been sharing some thoughts on the game industry and the PlayStation brand, such as why the PlayStation Vita trailed behind in popularity with competitors like the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In a new interview, he said that there was a combination of factors that lead the Vita to sell poorly. One reason was its proprietary memory cards. They were incredibly expensive and just added more costs for the consumer. While the PSP had the proprietary memory sticks, players were also able to use micro SD cards with an adapter.</p><p>In addition to the beautiful OLED screen, the Vita also had a back touchpad. While it provided some clever mechanics and gimmicks for some games, it was ultimately unnecessary. Both the OLED screen and touchpad further contributed to costs. One feature that was removed from the final product was a video-out option, which was present in the development kit version.</p><a href="https://www

<p>Nintendo finally, formally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">took the wraps off the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, giving us our first official look at the new Joy-Con controllers, a new Mario Kart game, and more. But the company also gave us a glimpse at how the size compares to the older Switch system.</p><p>A comparison on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html">official site</a> shows the two consoles side-by-side, and sure enough, the Switch 2 looks noticeably larger, but still approximately the same size as other handheld devices like the original Switch or Steam Deck. The bezel also appears smaller, which increases the screen real estate. A recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/">recent leak</a> from accessory manufacturer Genki suggested the Switch 2 would be about one inch wider and a half-inch taller, wi

<p>Nintendo has seemingly revealed what looks like a brand-new Mario Kart game for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> in the console's trailer.</p><p>Near the end of the Switch 2's reveal trailer, Mario Kart footage of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Peach, and Toad driving through a desert track can be seen with a sign that says "Yoshi," which looks to be some sort of restaurant or gas station.</p><p>While the trailer didn't confirm whether this is an entirely original Mario Kart game as opposed to another expanded port of Mario Kart 8, there's some new details that people have picked up on. It looks like Donkey Kong's character model in this game was inspired by the character's look in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-the-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512972/">Super Mario Bros. movie</a>.
