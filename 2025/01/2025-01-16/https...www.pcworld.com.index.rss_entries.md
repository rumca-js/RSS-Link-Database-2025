<p>One of the best ways to make your room look awesome without completely remodeling is to get some gorgeous LED strip lights that can shift to nearly whatever color you want them to be.</p>



<p>Govee’s 100-feet RGBIC LED strip is a fantastic pick for that, and right now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Assistant-Segmented-Multiple-Changing/dp/B09VBZC2CX/">it’s on sale for $44 on Amazon</a>, a solid discount from its $73 MSRP. Note this is a lightning deal, so it ends as soon as stock is claimed.</p>



<p>Given how long this LED strip is, and given that it has RBGIC capabilities, and given that it’s by a reputable brand like Govee, this is a fantastic price worth jumping on. In fact, it’s what I wish I’d paid for it when I got one for my kid’s room a few weeks ago.</p>



<p>Not only does this light strip look gorgeous, but it’s so fun to play with. Y

<p>Duolingo <a href="https://x.com/duolingo/status/1879582775055176008">reports</a> that interest in learning Chinese (Mandarin) on the language learning app has increased by a whopping 216 percent among Americans compared to this time last year.</p>



<p>This surge in interest comes as TikTok faces a ban in the US that will take place on Sunday, January 19. With TikTok potentially shutting its doors, American users are turning to a similar app called RedNote (also known as Xiaohongshu), a Chinese social media platform.</p>



<p>Because the app is dominated by Chinese users, many of whom are overseas, most of its content is in Chinese — so American TikTok refugees  are learning the language to better participate in the community.</p>



<p>The US government previously decided to ban TikTok because the video-sharing app allegedly collects data to be shared w

## Here are 20 YouTube Shorts creators I love, as TikTok’s ban looms

<p>There’s a lot of stuff happening right now. Here in the US, it seems kind of inescapable. And it surely doesn’t help that a <em>lot </em>of people might be without their short-form social video fix very soon. TikTok, for all its many, many faults, is something millions of people use in the US. That said, a TikTok ban <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2317334/could-a-vpn-circumvent-the-tiktok-ban.html">seems increasingly likely</a>.</p>



<p>But there is another. There are a lot of others, actually, all initially trying to ape TikTok’s success, now poised to try and fully replace it. My personal poison (only slightly joking) is YouTube Shorts, perhaps because it happens to be built into the thing I already use. I have <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419276/i-block-every-ad-on-youtube-and-im-not-ashamed-to-admit-it.html">a lot of beef with

<p>For nearly as long as we’ve had smartphones, there have been attempts to turn them into something “more.” Motorola tried with the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/499862/article-2515.html">Atrix 4G and Webtop</a> chassis back in 2011, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/407805/razers-project-linda-turns-the-razer-phone-into-a-laptop.html">Razer’s Project Linda</a> gave the concept another whirl in 2018.</p>



<p>But the dream of taking a smartphone, plugging in peripherals, and using it like a laptop never <em>quite</em> came to life. The closest thing we ever got to a success is Samsung’s DeX, but even that hasn’t truly taken off.</p>



<p>With the latest rumblings in Android devices, the concept might be ready for another go. More devices now support display output over USB, plus desktop-style interfaces, plus serious leaps in performa
