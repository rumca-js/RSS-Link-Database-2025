## Looking for Modern Fantasy with a Classic Feel

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks</p> <p>I feel like the above is the right way to phrase what I&#39;m looking for, but I&#39;ll explain a bit further.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something that has all the typical stuff you&#39;d come to expect from a fantasy novel: plucky heroes, magic swords, monsters, maybe some elves and dwarves, and generally a good time.</p> <p>The problem is, I tend to bounce off a lot of older fantasy titles. I don&#39;t know why, I just do, so preferably something written in the last 15 years or so.</p> <p>So I&#39;d love something newer that ticks a lot of the above boxes! Much appreciated! Bonus points if it&#39;s under 500 pages, but I understand that can be a big ask for what I&#39;m looking for.</p> <p>Books I&#39;ve read that sort of fit the vibe; <em>Kings of the Wyld</em> and <em>Bloody Rose</em> by Nicolas Eames, <em>The Blacktongue Thief</em> by Christopher Beuhlman, and <em>The Sword Defiant</em> by Gareth Hanrahan</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t tell you how many times I will mention that I didn&#39;t like an aspect of a book, or a character in a book, to have someone tell me that my opinion is wrong because &quot;it&#39;s realistic isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p> <p>I think a lot of readers do indeed have this viewpoint that &quot;realistic&quot; and &quot;good/enjoyable&quot; are synonyms in a way. A lot of this comes from the rise of grimdark and a pushback on classic fantasy tropes where characters and situations are more black/white.</p> <p>For example, If I&#39;m reading a book that features female characters constantly being assaulted, having no autonomy, and being victimized all the time, then that&#39;s a NO for me. Some might say &quot;that is realistic for medieval times though!&quot; And while that&#39;s maybe true, I still don&#39;t want it.

I enjoyed occasional SF picnics, but found it&#39;s not really my groove. Grimdark I love, but didn&#39;t read enough of it I think. I didn&#39;t really enjoy Abercrombie. I enjoyed Mark Lawrence, if his books are grimdark. I love me some good heist books like The Thief or The Palace Job. Lynch&#39;s books too, of course. </p> <p>I love magic. Dragons. Witches. Necromancers. Talking animals. Nice magic systems, good world building, humor to go along with. Books with maps and good old-fashioned violence.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can I get a book recommendation where the protagonist wins against the villain because they are smart and not just because they’re the protagonist and “good always triumphs over evil” bs. I’d love to see a book where the protagonist wins because they know more about magic, are generally clever or are willing to make necessary sacrifices. I’d love to see a victory that feels earned versus the trope where the character has to sacrifice the world to save their friend but somehow both get saved anyway because you know, plot armour or whatever. Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gold_Writer_8039"> /u/Gold_Writer_8039 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i2g2ey/books_where_the_protagonist_wins_because_they_are/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i2g2ey/books_where_the_protagonist_wins_because_they_are/">[comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for a book rec for my husband. He LOVED Name of the Wind. Also a fan of the Wheel of Time series, and (so far) the Witcher series. </p> <p>And then Harry Potter, LOTR, the hobbit, those classics. He has also enjoyed Leigh Bardugo (six of crows and ninth house, not so much S&amp;B). </p> <p>Looking for a book or series that is really well written, fantasy focused, similar to the above - and hopefully one recommended by multiple people on here. Too many different suggestions in the other threads I saw.</p> <p>TIA!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NervousEmployee"> /u/NervousEmployee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i2dzzy/need_a_recommendation_similar_to_these_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i2dzzy/need_a_recommendation_similar_to_these_books/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve just started book 3 and I feel like I’ve missed exposition at some point. I was under the impression that everyone could use ONE type of fury per person. (For example, Amara is Air and Isana is Water) I vaguely remember Bernard being unique because he could kind of do two?? And I remember that the First Lord could do all of them.</p> <p>But now in book 3 we have Max using all of them, and I’m just confused.</p> <p>1) Can people use all of the furies? (If so, why have I not seen Amara or Isana use other types?)</p> <p>2) Do some choose to only specialize in one?</p> <p>3) Also, why do some have actual furies (like Pokémon) but others simply use the power without the help of a creature?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kooky_County9569"> /u/Kooky_County9569 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i2cm68/codex_alera_furycrafting_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp

## What is your particular brand of archetypal fantasy?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me it&#39;s David Gemmell. I read him at a formative age in the late 80&#39;s, and his particular brand of antihero struggling to do the right thing against a backdrop of a world that cares naught for humanity&#39;s struggles left an indelible mark on my psyche. Such that I wrote my college application essay about the role of nihilism in his Drenai novels.</p> <p>That&#39;s not to say that other series weren&#39;t also formative: Feist and Wurts&#39; Empire trilogy, The Fionavar Tapestry by GGK, and the Fighting Fantasy books all left their mark when I was young. But when I think archetypal fantasy, I think Gemmell.</p> <p>Who played that formative role for you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Phil_Tucker"> /u/Phil_Tucker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i2ceso/what_is_your_particular_brand_of_archetypal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.
