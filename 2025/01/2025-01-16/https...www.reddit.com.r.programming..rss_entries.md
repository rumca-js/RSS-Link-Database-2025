<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>5 months ago when i was looking for a playlist about javascript i came across a playlist by a channel Steve Griffith . It was 180 videos playlist looking at views and how 3,4 years old content i skipped it But after some days a video from that channel named the last fetch tutorial you need : came across and luckily i was also struggling in that . Which encouraged me to watch 2 hours playlist . I bet i have never ever seen a fetch tutorial with that much detailing and the topics that no one taught me . Never does even in paid online courses . then I checked that playlist of js and it was like i found a Hidden treasure on YouTube . That js playlist is the best ever ja playlist i have ever seen every single topic is best . When i checked other videos it was amazing . That guy is posting for years and the channel itself has content of whole degree of Cs.</p> <p>I also want you to must check it once . He deserves a gold for his work <a href="https://youtu
