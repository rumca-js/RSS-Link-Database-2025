<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I got a laptop that has AMD E2-7110 APU with like 4GB RAM and a small SSD. Both storage and RAM can be upgraded but I doubt it would help much knowing that I will be using this machine for programming. I plan to program some C/C++, python and Gleam on NixOS. I am kinda new to linux but am not afraid to get things done with terminal and overcoming any obstacles. I have prior experience with Debian. Should I continue with this venture or get like another old laptop but like slightly better specs? Thank you for giving me your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Automatic_Revenue421"> /u/Automatic_Revenue421 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i2v12l/is_this_cpu_too_old_for_linux_and_programming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i2v12l/is_this_cpu_too_old_for_linux_and_programming/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I am currently a senior in my final semester of my network administration degree. I am taking a class this semester called advanced topics in networking which is essentially a guided self study class where we need to create a project based on things we haven’t learned directly through our curriculum. While Linux was covered in my degree, it was definitely not gone into with very much detail outside of an Introduction to Linux course. For my project I’d like to create an entire network environment in Linux(DNS, DHCP, AD DS, email server, etc) and eventually connecting windows machines to the domain. Are there any specific programs or applications I should be looking at? Any advice for this project would obviously be appreciated but just wanted to try and cut down on some research time by making a post here. TIA for any insight.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mgamer327"> /u/Mgamer327 </a>

I was getting tired of managing the destination of new data, so I decided to take everything off the drives and put them in a RAID5 array. I&#39;m running Ubuntu v24, so MDADM is included and the online tutorials are plentiful. I followed one tutorial and everything was fine. The RAID5 assembly took more than 24 hours, but I wasn&#39;t surprised. One conflicting piece of information was the initial state of the drives: most of the tutorials said nothing about creating a partition first (just /dev/sd&lt;n&gt;), while others said to create linux raid autodetect partitions (so /dev/sd&lt;n&gt;1). I could even get fdisk to make that partition type...</p> <p>I verified the process had compeleted. Formatted the array (/dev/md0) in ext4, mounted it and I had one big drive (as I wanted). I put data on the drive as a test and it work. I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a High School Computer Science teacher. I am interested in turning several old Apple powerbooks into Linux machines and managing them in a lab in my classroom as a learning project for me and for students. I have been using Linux on and off for many years but would not call myself an expert. I love learning new stuff though. </p> <p>Our district uses Google everything so would love google logins to system at boot. Have been really impressed with the integration of Google on POP_OS Gnome. That would be my first choice for a distro. Mostly K12 lab management is done at the district level these days and is very highly controlled. I want to try the other way around. Low control but easy recovery. </p> <p>Anyone have any suggestions for where to start my journey. My research has lead me to topics like virtualization, containers, LDAP, etc. Thank you for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/
