This time I knew the laptop is sufficient to play Alyx in high resolutions. I have 1Gb fiber connection, but only 60Mb upload... After month of various tweaking I finally turned off Automatically Adjust Bitrate in Virtual Desktop (with setting bitrate manually below 60) and bam! Stutters gone! Setting it with same values manually, but with Automatic Bitrate on before, had almost constant 1-3 frame drops. Too bad that bespoke VD option doesn&#39;t work as intended and in addition has a warning saying turning it off can negatively affect performance.

The way that I view this, is AR glasses, which show Pokemon in real time in natural/woodsy settings. You would have actual Pokeballs, which are connected to the AR interface through bluetooth, and actually open up and catch the Pokemon. The information for that Pokemon gets stored, and then you keep it as time goes on.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey i have amis tier pc with a r7 5700x3d and a 7600xt with 16gb and was looking for an optimal vr headset for iracing. I tried out a hp reverb g2 and was really concerned by the discomfort of the headset along with very poor software i just sent it back straight away. I now went back to my single monitor buck can\u2019t get passed the immersion i got with vr and i want more of that. What headset would you recommend that is not overly expensive, comfortable and with decent software and that is good for simracing ? I don\u2019t really care to much about the specs as my pc was just able to run the reverb g2 at 90fps so i don\u2019t bother a bit older headset. i am very worried about the compressed connections using the quest 3 or pico 4 and also the weight of the older pimax headsets i was looking at. Help me i have no idea what choice i should make. Thank you </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Redk_vision\"> /u/Red",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently got my hands on a Varjo XR-4, and I foolishly thought that integrating it with Unity would be straightforward, as per <a href=\"https://developer.varjo.com/docs/unity-xr-sdk/getting-started-with-varjo-xr-plugin-for-unity\">this </a>tutorial and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuPlruceIRc\">this</a> video (I know, it&#39;s for XR-3 but the steps seem the same). I set up everything that is listed <a href=\"https://developer.varjo.com/docs/unity-xr-sdk/unity-xr-sdk\">here</a> in the official docs for Varjo XR-4 Unity XR SDK, but when I go into Play Mode, nothing happens. I&#39;ve been able to run the SteamVR Plugin on the headset (get into the SteamVR environment), but no luck with the Varjo Unity XR Plugin.</p> <p>Has anyone been able to run a Unity project in Play Mode directly on Varjo XR-4? Any help would be appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
