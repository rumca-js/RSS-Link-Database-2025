The penguin should be facing towards the right side of the picture. Make the landscape and moon realistic, with the penguin in a more cartoon style. the border should fade to the same blue color on all sides.</p> <p>I‚Äôve tried all the top AI image generation apps that I could find which had good reviews (the free trial for the pro versions). None of them are able to understand more than half of what I put in the prompt, and most can‚Äôt even get the simple stuff right like the direction the penguin is supposed to face and where the moon goes. It also doesn‚Äôt help much to try and explain or correct them. The two hardest parts that none of the models did right

This made me wonder: could AI become a more groundbreaking technology than blockchain? Or is their synergy capable of creating something entirely new?</p> <p>AI helps analyze data and automate processes, while blockchain ensures transparency, decentralization, and security. For instance, the Runtime Offchain Logic Framework (<a href="https://docs.oasis.io/rofl/">ROFL</a>) enables complex computations to run off-chain while maintaining verifiability and confidentiality through trusted execution environments (TEE).
