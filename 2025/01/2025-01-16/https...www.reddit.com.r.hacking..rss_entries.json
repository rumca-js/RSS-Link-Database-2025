In addition, the consensus right now seems to be that almost all remote digital activity is traceable with the right tools. So it follows that petty criminal hackers (i.e. those who aren&#39;t hacking for a govt agency) will get traced and arrested.</p> <p>How often does this actually happen? Cause it seems to me that if it&#39;s such a high-risk crime people would rarely do it. Is it actually quite resource-intensive to trace and arrest hackers, is it actually quite common so resource is spread thin, or is it just a low priority for law enforcement (until a &quot;big target&quot; is hit)?</p> <p>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not hoping for a low answer and then changing career.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",
