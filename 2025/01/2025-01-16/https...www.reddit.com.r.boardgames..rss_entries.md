## Train board game in the U.S./Western U.S. where you don't play as a "baron"?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently taken an interest in Leaving Earth (great space race game for those unaware, would def recommend) and want to buy it, however in most places it&#39;s $100+ for the core game. The official website has the core game for $40 which is much more reasonable, however the site itself looks extremely sketchy. They have the board game, but zero reviews, and everything else they sell is craft supplies and other non-tabletop related products. The link is on the games BGG page, but I still don&#39;t entirely trust it. If anyone has purchased from the website, please let me know how it went!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve recently started playing Ark Nova in solo mode. I&#39;ve tried it three times so far, and have not won yet. I&#39;m not looking for strategy, but rather asking a rules question. The solo game ended, but I was below five conservation points. I did, however, have a lot of appeal. As I was counting up my endgame points, I realized that the conservation points I was earning from my brown cards, pushed me past five and eight. My question is, do I pick up the bonuses from the five spot and the eight spot during end of game scoring? Since I did not know what the rules were, I went ahead and picked up those bonuses and they just happened to push me up another two conservation points by covering up an association and a university on my map. Would I then discard one of my three brown cards (I put out an early elephant to get a third brown card)? Could I have counted my three brown cards in a different order and then discarded one that I already sco

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey wingspan lovers. My girlfriend and I have been playing Wingspan for around 6 months (its the game that got her into the hobby as she loves birds) The Oceana expansion arrived in the mail today and we love it. We have some experience with the Oceana expansion due to playing it on holiday with my family. Long story short, we are wondering if the other two expansions (Europe and Asia) enhance the gameplay experience or should we stick to just playing the Oceana expansion. We are after any advice from people who own those expansions and weather you enjoy them or not. Cheers. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JakeSyd3"> /u/JakeSyd3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i2girp/are_the_wingspan_expansions_beyond_oceana_worth_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i2girp/are_the_wingspan_expansions_beyond_oceana_worth

## When does a board game stop being fun and become more like work?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As passionate gamers, we’ve likely all encountered a board game that, while clever and well-designed, feels more like a job than a joy. It seems like some designers get so focused on blending intricate mechanisms strategic depth, or perfect balance that the simple essence of fun gets left behind.</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong—I love heavier games with complex strategies and layered gameplay. I don’t mind having to mastering tough systems and navigating intricate rules. But even in the heaviest games, there needs to be a sense of satisfaction and purpose that keeps us coming back.

How do designers create something that challenges us without feeling too procedural? What separates a “heavy but fun” game from one that feels like a chore?</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts:</p> <p>• Have you played a game that felt more like work than
