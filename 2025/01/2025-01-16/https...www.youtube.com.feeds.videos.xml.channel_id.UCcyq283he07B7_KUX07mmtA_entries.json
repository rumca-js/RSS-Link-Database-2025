        "description": "Synthetic food dyes add a burst of color to many beloved American foods, such as candy, cereal, and even bacon. But some dyes \u2014 like Red No. 3 \u2014 have links to cancer, behavioral disorders, and other health issues.\n\nNow, after more than 30 years, the FDA is banning Red No. 3 in cereals and other food products. The move comes as California is poised to ban synthetic dyes in schools and as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushes for a nationwide ban on artificial dyes.\n\nBut how did synthetic dyes take over America's food system in the first place? And how will the FDA's new policy change how food giants formulate their products? Health editor Mia de Graaf breaks it down.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:43 - The History Of Dyes\n01:35 - Synthetic Food Dyes In America\n02:50 - Health Impacts Of Synthetic Food Dyes\n04:31 - Initial Bans On Artificial Food Dyes\n04:39 - FDA's Ban On Red No. 3\n05:30 - RFK's Battle On Dyes\n06:04 - Behavioral Disorders And Synthetic Dyes\n06:49 - The Temporary Removal Of Dyes In Cereals\n07",
