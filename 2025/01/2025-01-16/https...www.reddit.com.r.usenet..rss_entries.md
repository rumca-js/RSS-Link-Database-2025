<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies for the noob-ish question.</p> <p>If indexers catalog usenet groups wouldn&#39;t the backbone they elect to fill their NZB database with vary from backbone to backbone? I don&#39;t know the answer. I&#39;m just curious if we classify providers (resellers) according to the backbone they&#39;re on, wouldn&#39;t there also be a difference between indexers depending on the backbone they&#39;re indexing?</p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/i_am_fear_itself"> /u/i_am_fear_itself </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i2q4gx/meta_question_about_indexers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i2q4gx/meta_question_about_indexers/">[comments]</a></span>
