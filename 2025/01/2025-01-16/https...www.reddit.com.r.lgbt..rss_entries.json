I wanted to share a bit about the difficulties and issues transgender women face in Russia, maybe it will be interesting to someone:</p> <ol> <li>In general, transgender transitions have been banned here, and changing documents to reflect the correct gender marker is not possible. I am one of those who didn\u2019t manage to change my documents \ud83d\ude14</li> <li>Discrimination is something we often face. I had to go through the military commission and prove that I can\u2019t serve in the army. I can\u2019t go to the gym because they either try to ignore me or don\u2019t let me into the women\u2019s locker room, but they also can\u2019t let me into the men\u2019s locker room. This is just a small part of everything.</li> <li>I often have to come out and face strange looks and judgment.</li> <li>Medicine is probably the hardest part. It\u2019s very difficult to get help without facing issues and phobias. I have to go to private clinics almost blindly, but I\u2019m thankful to those who remai",
