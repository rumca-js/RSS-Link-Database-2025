Nintendo has finally revealed the Switch 2 and it's looking great. Besides revealing its design, Nintendo has also confirmed a couple of new things for the hybrid gaming console. A new console feature and perhaps, a new game.

Blade Chimera puts players in the shoes of a demon hunter, called named Shin. While on a routine mission to kill demons, Shin comes across a shapeshifting demon that can turn into a magical floating sword. The two then team up to figure out what happened to his loved ones in a world where even just the suspicion of someone being a demon is enough to warrant killing them.

While its main plot hook is quite interesting, the highlight of Blade Chimera is definitely its gameplay. It features incredibly tight gameplay thanks to responsive controls and great enemy design where just about every demon you face tends to have its own quirks that you have to deal with. The game also features fantastic boss fights that, while not too difficult, still manage to feel incredibly satisfying to take down.

This video aims to unpack all there is to know about Kingdom Come: Deliverance II’s immersive systems, and there’s plenty here to get excited over before the sequel releases proper on 4th February.
