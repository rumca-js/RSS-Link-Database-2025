It begins as the sun sets over Antarctica and the over-winter crew at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station settle in for a long six months of night. However, upon intercepting two Chinese vehicles on a 700 mile traverse across the continent to the South Pole, our crew discover a grisly scene with far-reaching ramifications; the first murder in Antarctica. In this near-future, America and China are at a stalemate in the third World War.
