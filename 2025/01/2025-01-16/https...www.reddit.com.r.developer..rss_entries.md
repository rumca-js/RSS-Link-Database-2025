<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently working as engineering manager. my last working day is next week.</p> <p>Today i noticed that my job title was changed from engineering manager to software engineer without any prior notice. I actually donâ€™t care since it is my last week but experience letter show which last position i was holding at the time of release. My manager is toxic and i think he must have done it intentionally.</p> <p>Is this change going to affect me in anyway in future. What should i do ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mean_Razzmatazz_8014"> /u/Mean_Razzmatazz_8014 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i2xh3p/last_working_day_is_next_week_and_my_job_title/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i2xh3p/last_working_day_is_next_week_and_my_job_title/">[comments]</a></span>
