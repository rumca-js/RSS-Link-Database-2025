In today's Daily Fix:
It's finally here, the announcement we've all been waiting for: the Nintendo Switch 2 is real...and that's about all we know for sure. A trailer for the new console didn't have anything in the way of specs, price, or release date, but did confirm a few things: the Joy-Con will be magnetic and can be used like a mouse, it will have two USB-C ports, and Switch 1 cartridges will fit in the system. Want to try it for yourself? We have details on a preview event Nintendo will hold later this year in select cities. In related news, the new Switch 2 trailer did show off what looks like a new Mario Kart, and we have a few details on that. And finally, a popular mod to bring GTA 4-era Liberty City into the modern age has been taken down. Maybe this means an official remaster (or maybe remake?) of GTA 4 could be in the works.

Wolf Man, reviewed by Katie Rife. Narrated by Erik Adams.
Leigh Whannell’s Wolf Man is impeccably made, with a unique take on werewolf lore. But the emphasis is on craft over storytelling. Universal has updated its most famous lycanthrope for the 2020s with some very successful camera wizardry and stylish lighting and sound design. But the storytelling is less successful, sacrificing tension for muddy commentary on gender.

In today's Daily Fix:
January is already half over, but Sony is still adding games to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue. New additions include God of War: Ragnarök, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand, and more. Retro titles Medieval 2 and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings (hopefully this can hold PS5 players over until the excellent The Great Circle arrives). In other news, Microsoft has been hit with even more layoffs across several divisions including gaming. The number of affected staff is currently unknown. And finally, the last content update for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is out, adding new weapons and cosmetics and a true ending to the game. And just like most of the story, the ending is proving to already be controversial.
