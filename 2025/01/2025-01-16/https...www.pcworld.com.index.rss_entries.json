Note this is a lightning deal, so it ends as soon as stock is claimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given how long this LED strip is, and given that it has RBGIC capabilities, and given that it\u2019s by a reputable brand like Govee, this is a fantastic price worth jumping on. In fact, it\u2019s what I wish I\u2019d paid for it when I got one for my kid\u2019s room a few weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does this light strip look gorgeous, but it\u2019s so fun to play with.

Here in the US, it seems kind of inescapable. And it surely doesn\u2019t help that a <em>lot </em>of people might be without their short-form social video fix very soon. TikTok, for all its many, many faults, is something millions of people use in the US. That said, a TikTok ban <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2317334/could-a-vpn-circumvent-the-tiktok-ban.html\">seems increasingly likely</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is another. There are a lot of others, actually, all initially trying to ape TikTok\u2019s success, now poised to try and fully replace it. My personal poison (only slightly joking) is YouTube Shorts, perhaps because it happens to be built into the thing I already use. I have <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2419276/i-block-every-ad-on-youtube-and-im-not-ashamed-to-admit-it.html\">a lot of beef with ",
