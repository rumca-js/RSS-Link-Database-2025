<p>From handing over the Chagos Islands to compensating Gerry Adams, Starmer's decisions owe more to human rights lawyers than sound politics. He needs to sack his chum Lord Hermer before he shipwrecks his Government.</p>

<p>One figure that has been repeatedly cited in the grooming gangs debate is that 1 in 73 Muslim men in the town of Rotherham has been prosecuted for grooming gang offences. However, this figure is slightly misleading.</p>

<p>Keir Starmer wants Britain to be both an "AI superpower" and a "clean energy superpower". He can't have it both ways, says Ben Pile. AI is hugely energy intensive and inconsistent with the path Net Zero is leading us down.</p>
