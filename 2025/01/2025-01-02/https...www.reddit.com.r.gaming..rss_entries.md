There was the science classroom where one section you went under like some laser which made you microscopic, and then under a microscope and the scene changed to like a Petri dish. Amazing.<br/> The kitchen one - you would drive into the microwave I think and it would make you miniature or teleport you elsewhere or something.<br/> Every level had something fun like this.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone. Happy new year. </p> <p>I am a big fan of games where you fight with a sword. I have played all dark souls and elden ring. Although parry is part of the game mechanics I&#39;ve never dived into it. Therefore... I suck big time. I have thought for a while of doing a only parry run in elden ring and use that as excuse for learning, but after the DLC, im taking a break from elden ring. There is also two games I dream of playing, Sekiro and Lies of P, because the story and visuals are so damn interesting, but yeah... I feel I will get overwhelmed with a parry mechanics that I am yet to master. So it occurred to me, what about playing a few games where parry is easy, and then pump up the level to more challenging parry mechanics. What would be a beginner, intermediate and challenging game? And where do you place Elden Ring, Sekiro and Lies of P in terms of parry difficulty? Feel free to give any suggestion. Of course some games I will dig

She used to love baldurs gate.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Happy 2025 everyone! As we start off the new year I was curious to see what people’s approaches are to completing their backlog this year. Especially with all these winter sales wrapping up. </p> <p>As someone with a really bad spending habit and buying deals for multiple systems I’ve decided to dedicate myself to one console only this year. This year I’m picking the Switch because I’ve owned the console for 5 almost 6 years now and have only completed 2 games. Now with the Switch 2 estimated releasing this year I want to focus on my backlog on that and actually complete the games I spent good money on. It’s probably the smallest library I have but still months and months worth of games. </p> <p>What’s everyone else plans? Or are you going to go full gremlin mode and keep stacking up the games? (No judgement, I’m the same way lmao) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PatrickHasAReddit"> /u/PatrickHa
