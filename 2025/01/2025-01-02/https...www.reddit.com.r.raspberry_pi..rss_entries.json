Got a UPS HAT at the bottom (fits perfectly in my 3D-printed case, running on two 18650 batteries), and slapped on an aluminium case with a built-in heatsink + PWM fan. Works great for both passive and active cooling. The best part is Plug-and-play KVM control over USB to my Android phone or tablet. It\u2019s like VNC but no WiFi or LAN needed. Just plug it in and boom\u2014full control :D Especially I love throwing it in my backpack, for on-the-go tasks without worrying to look for power supply and network. Your thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",
