<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Folks, Just wanted to share my experience/thoughts and see if anyone has done similar.</p> <p>I&#39;ve just used my Turkish FUPS debit card to pay the a lifetime VIP membership on a Usenet indexer without issue. I haven&#39;t used my FUPS account card in about 6-9 months since I left Turkish Netflix after the account sharing clampdown. I had some money left on my my FUPS bank account that was going unused so I just used it to get the VIP account, it worked fine as you would expect from an official visa card.</p> <p>Going forward it&#39;s seems to me to be a pretty safe/secure way of paying for a Usenet provider for uploading too. I know not many people have a FUPS account and going forward new FUPS account can&#39;t be open without an actually Turkish ID cards but for those of us in the EU and USA who beat that restriction it seems like a nice alternative to using bitcoin.</p> <p>Just wondering any Usenet users here have done similar ? Any pitfall

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all - appreciate your support !</p> <p>I&#39;m using SunnyUsenet as my main provider, but currently I&#39;m only getting 93% of what I&#39;m looking for. I have tried to add both NewsHosting and BulkNews EU as additional providers, but I&#39;m not seeing any improvement - any suggestions to what I&#39;m doing wrong and what might help?</p> <p>I use NZBGeek as indexer. I find most of what I&#39;m looking for here, but am considering a second indexer to improve my setup. Any suggestions here would be appeciated as well.</p> <p>Many thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NotThe3nd"> /u/NotThe3nd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hruwl7/too_many_blocklisted_results_what_am_i_doing_wrong/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hruwl7/too_many_blocklisted_results_what_am_i_doing_wrong/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TLDR at the bottom if you just want the question without the backstory/context.</strong></p> <p>I&#39;ve hit the point of wanting to tear my hair out and I figured I should ask here to see if anyone has advice.</p> <p>I got an Eweka account years ago. It was throttled to 300 megabits/sec - their &quot;high speed&quot; account, i think it was called.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I upgraded it to the new &quot;Unlimited Speed&quot; tier when I re-subbed for the year. I noticed I didn&#39;t get faster speed, but chalked it up to the fact that I&#39;m in the US and they&#39;re in the EU, plus 300mbit is good enough, and I had another provider carrying a lot of my load. (I have gigabit fiber as my internet.) Note, I am not saying I get &quot;around 300 megabits/sec,&quot; I get <strong>precisely</strong> 300. Downloads start off a little above and quickly throttle down to exactly 300mbit over a 2-5 second period.</p> <p>Back in November, I helped
