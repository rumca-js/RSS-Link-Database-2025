<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, this might be a longshot but I was playing around with random select on my Anbernic the other day and came across a certain game, but now I forget what it was called and I can&#39;t find it again to go back to it.</p> <p>I&#39;m about 90% sure that it was an Amstrad CPC game, but it&#39;s possible I&#39;m wrong about that. You play as a ball or balloon of some kind flying around a level that looked and played a lot like Joust, made of various platforms that you fly around trying to bump into other balls from a slightly higher elevation in order to destroy them. If you bump into a ball that&#39;s higher up than you are then it sends you straight down, and if you&#39;re already close to a floor then it will send you through it possibly to your death. Once you destroy all the balls you move on to the next level, each level has different platforms on it, and after 5 lives it&#39;s game over.</p> <p>I want to say it was something with &quot;ball&quot;

## Is it better to set 7th gen consoles video output at 720p or 1080p for a 4kTV

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m getting a 4k TV but I still play with xbox360 and ps3. I&#39;d like to know whether is better to have the video output of those consoles at 720p or 1080p in a 4k TV. </p> <p>I know most games are either 720p or sub HD, and scaled to 1080p you get an uneven pixel distribution. That&#39;s how I played in a full hd tv. Otherwise in 4k each pixel from a 720p resolution can be multiplied by 3x3, which should produce a crispier image. </p> <p>But I&#39;m not sure if this is noticeable, and in case it isn&#39;t, i dont know if setting consoles to 720p would even make the console UI look worse. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/raver01"> /u/raver01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hrgylb/is_it_better_to_set_7th_gen_consoles_video_output/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hrgylb/is_it_better_to_set_7th_

## Last old school game you beat in 2024? Mine was Capcom’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit for Game Boy. Much, much better than the NES game by Rareware/LJN and an early Shinji Mikami game.
