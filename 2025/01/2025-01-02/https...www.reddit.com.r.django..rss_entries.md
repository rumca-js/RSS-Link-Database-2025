<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, how are you? </p> <p>What is the best approach to a folder structure in a Django project? </p> <p>The project will grow gradually and I would like a concise structure that allows for this growth, while not being a mess and making it easy for other people to start coding in this structure if necessary. </p> <p>The project will be a system for schools, with two &quot;fronts&quot;, basically a class management system, where teachers will be able to publish classes. There are more things regarding the application, but this is its core.</p> <p>This would be the first &quot;front&quot;, the second &quot;front&quot; is the part of the students, who will enter the portal and be able to see these classes. </p> <p>I&#39;m using Django as FullStack, with Templates and using Bootstrap for styling, PostgreSQL as database.</p> <p>Could anyone tell me a good folder structure for a project like this that will grow? </p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_O

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try and ask this question as clearly as I can, apologies if it is not clear.</p> <p>I am working on an app which has django, django-allauth and vue. I am implementing django-allauth in headless mode.</p> <p>Everything works fine, but:</p> <p>Let&#39;s say I sign up with email/password, and activate 2FA.<br/> Later I link my google account via SSO.</p> <p>In theory, I should now be able to log in via email/password + 2fa, or SSO via Google.</p> <p>However, the user session is lost when Google redirects me back to my app after logging in on my Google account.</p> <p>The compounding issue is that if everything is the same, but there is no 2FA activated on the account, then the Google redirect/login works perfectly.</p> <p>Also, everything, including the 2FA element works when testing not via headless (It asks for the 2FA code after redirecting back from Google), but for the life of me I can not track down where, or where to look, to see why it 

## Why my tests are failing because of LOGGING configuration?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After I added LOGGING configuration to my settings.py and then separate settings into base, local, production environments, my tests started to fail. I thought it was because of some settings on base file were not correct, and I forgot to get some in my settings.py. Going back and forth on my commit history for some time, I noticed that the change I did was on LOGGING configuration I included, causing my tests to fail. When I delete LOGGING configuration completely, the tests are passing. This leads to my CI on GitHub Action to also fail. Anyone explain to me why the LOGGING causing such an issue? If is not then why my tests are failing because they were all wrong from beginning and LOGGING just showed it to me?</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/berkaykrc/task-manager-api/tree/feature/data-population">https://github.com/berkaykrc/task-manager-api/tree/feature/data-population</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>i have a Django project where i started using HTMX and django-template-paritals. It works great so far. Now i have the problem, that I trigger a htmx get after some iteraction of the user and want to show the response at multiple locations. How can i do this? Everything I tested did only update the first occurence of the element, lets say i specified a css class in the target. </p> <p>Is there a best practice how to solve these issues? Its a common problem to me. Since I need to display elements of the page at different positions for different screens, I want htmx to update all the targeted elements.</p> <p>Hope you guys can follow/understand my problem.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bruecksen"> /u/bruecksen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hrxmm7/best_practice_django_htmx_djangotemplatepartials/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><

## Django replacing all top-level single quotes in template with double quotes

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So Django refuses to render my templates with single quotes. I&#39;m passing a dictionary into an <code>hx-headers</code> attribute on an element, which necessitates I wrap the dictionary in single quotes and have the JSON dict items in double quotes. For some reason, Django doesn&#39;t like this. Take for example the following element:</p> <p><code>&lt;div id=&#39;page-wrapper&#39; hx-headers=&#39;{&quot;code&quot;: &quot;{{ quiz.course.code }}&quot;, &quot;number&quot;:{{ quiz.number }}}&#39;&gt;</code></p> <p>That is how it&#39;s formatted in my template. But whenever I run the dev server and go to the url, all of the single quotes are replaced with double quotes, resulting in the following:</p> <p><code>&lt;div id=&quot;page-wrapper&quot; hx-headers=&quot;{&quot;code&quot;: &quot;RBT&quot;, &quot;number&quot;: 1}&quot;&gt;</code></p> <p>Obviously, the nested double quotes borks things. I have no idea how to change the behavior. It happens on ever
