        "description": "In May of 2024, Koei Tecmo announced\u00a0Dynasty Warriors: Origins,\u00a0a game billed as a return to the roots outing for the long-running series, and each time we have seen more of it, as we get closer and closer to its looming release, each time, it has looked like an increasingly exciting prospect- especially for\u00a0Dynasty Warriors\u00a0fans who are longing for a return to the series' golden days.\n\nEschewing its predecessor's open world structure,\u00a0Dynasty Warriors: Origins\u00a0is instead going to adopt a world map structure, with players being allowed to travel to and mess about in maps of varying sizes, both big and large, both linear and more open ended.",

But though many of them have been well received and widely recognized, several have flown under the radar and got less attention than they deserve. \n\nWith the year winding down, here, we're going to turn the spotlight on a few such gems.",
