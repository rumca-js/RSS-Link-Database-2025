Without going into details, it&#39;s a FOSS project with a few users, and I&#39;d like to have some &quot;data&quot; about most used features and how many people are actually using it - with possibility to opt-in or out of course. </p> <p>This is not a web-based app, but an app running directly on user&#39;s machine using Typescript (NodeJS). </p> <p>I bumped upon a few solutions such as PostHog, Mixpanel and Segment, I wonder if anyone has experience with these or similar tools? Or are they overkill for my use case ? </p> <p>Thanks for your help and happy new year :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pbeucher\"> /u/pbeucher </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hrralx/tool_or_sdk_to_get_analytics_on_app_usage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comment",
