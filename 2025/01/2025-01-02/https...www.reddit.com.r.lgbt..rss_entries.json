It seems to apply to everyone regardless of what they were assigned at birth, and variants of Aidan, Alice, Andre, Anthony, and Avery were the most common names overall. I\u2019ve also noticed that on name suggestion posts the most popular suggestions also tend to start with the letter A, or that the person in question just has A-name vibes.

A different aunt (not blood related) told my mum that my dads sister (the aunt in question) is seeing a woman. Now, this might not sound like a lot, but it genuinly made me tear up with joy. I&#39;ve always been compared to that aunt growing up, and now the fact that we both might be gay makes me so happy.
