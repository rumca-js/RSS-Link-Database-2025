So, I set out to design a 3D printable yarn winder. I challenged myself with two design constraints: 1: No additional hardware needed: I wanted the yarn winder to be fully 3Dprintable, so you do not need to go out and get extra hardware. The project is also fully glue free (I really dislike glue) 2: Sub 200g filament usage: The yarn winder should not cost too much filament. Sub 200 grams was a realistic goal. The result is a print of around 150 grams. (If you would use Bambu basic PLA refill the print would cost €3,50

This also gives some more sustain for the guitar. Although, the metal plate makes the bottom strings sound a bit &quot;ringy&quot;.
