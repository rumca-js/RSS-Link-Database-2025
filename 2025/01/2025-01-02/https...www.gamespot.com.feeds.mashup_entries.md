<p>Veteran game developer Ken Levine has shared his thoughts on generative AI, his latest game and it having high stakes, and why he believes we still don't really know what video games are.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine">GI.biz</a>, Levine said he believes generative AI is a "very powerful" tool that he doesn't want to underestimate. But he said it has many limitations in its current state, including persistence.</p><p>"You look at Sora, the ChatGPT video generator, you see a woman walking down the street and the street scene is beautiful--but if she were to turn around and walk backwards, it wouldn't remember where she has been," he said. "It doesn't currently understand persistence, although that may change."</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creator-thinks-we-still-dont-really-know-what-games-are-after-50-years/1100-6528614/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

<p>Prime Video's video game anthology series Secret Level debuted in December, featuring episodes inspired by all manner of video game franchises, but not Halo or Doom. It appears this wasn't for lack of trying, however. Supervising director Dave Wilson and creator Tim Miller recently discussed how they tried to work out a deal with Microsoft for Master Chief and the Doom Slayer, but it didn't work out.</p><p>Wilson told <a href="https://collider.com/secret-level-season-2-tim-miller-dave-wilson/">Collider</a> that because Secret Level was a brand-new idea, some of the development executives struggled to get on board because they had existing deals with other companies. He said what he heard from these executives was, "This is going to get in the way of everything we're doing."</p><p>Miller, meanwhile, pushed back against the idea that his team didn't try to get a franchise like Halo. They did, but Microsoft apparently decided to pass, though it's unclear why.</p><a href="https://www.

<p>Russia is looking to enter the video game console space by creating its own systems, and the country is reportedly planning on making two different kinds as it continues to feel the economic impact of its illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106133-russia-admits-domestic-consoles-cant-match-ps5-or.html">TechSpot</a>, one of them is reportedly a traditional console using the Elbrus processor, which is developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies. This processor is mainly used for applications such as critical infrastructure and defense. It's also reportedly going to use a domestic OS--either Aurora or Alt Linux.</p><p>In a statement on <a href="https://t.me/webstrangler/3937">Telegram</a>, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on information policy Anton Gorelkin confirmed that Elbrus processors aren't as powerful as the ones used in PS5 or Xbox, so Russia will have to take a unique approach to its consoles.</p><a href

Scanning and filming for OD was suspended due to the strike, however. For Physint, which is being published by Sony, Kojima said casting was suspended due to the strike. "We hope to resume [in 2025]," Kojima said.</p><p>As for Death Stranding 2, Kojima said, "We started to play and build up the game."

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> was one of 2024's biggest games, and while support remains ongoing, many are wondering what developer Arrowhead Studios might make next. We still don't know, but COO Johan Pilestedt has now confirmed he has an idea for what the team may make next.</p><p>Posting on social media, Pilestedt said, "What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept..."</p><p>The executive then invited people to share their "speculation" as to what Arrowhead could build next. One person said they'd like to see Arrowhead make a Star Fox-style game where players zip around on aircraft during on-rails missions before a level becomes open-world during a boss fight. Pilestedt said this matches up with the concept for a game Arrowhead wanted to make, "Eagles of Democracy." He even shared some images of this title--check them out below.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/art
