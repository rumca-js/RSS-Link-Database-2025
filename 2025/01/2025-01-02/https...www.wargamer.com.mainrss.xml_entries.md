								<p>What’s the point of playing a non-human character in <strong>DnD</strong>? No shade if you want to play an Orc or Elf just for the vibes - the concept of non-human sentient species is packed with storytelling potential, after all - but regular Dungeons and Dragons now plays the issue of fantasy races <em>so</em> safe that there's very little players can do with it.</p>

								<p>Buying singles can be a cheap way to expand your Magic: The Gathering collection, but not when it comes to the <strong>most expensive MTG cards</strong> of all time. We don’t recommend paying tens of thousands of dollars for a small cardboard rectangle, no matter its prestige, but it is fun to gawk at those who will.</p>
