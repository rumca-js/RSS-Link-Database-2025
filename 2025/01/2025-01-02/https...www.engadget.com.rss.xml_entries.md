(After all, Samsung is also the biggest <em>supplier</em> of OLED gaming monitor panels.) Sure enough, MSI followed suit the same day at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2025/">CES 2025</a> with two monitors with familiar specs: a 27-inch 4K QD-OLED display and a 27-inch QD-OLED one with a crazy-smooth 500Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>First up: the 27-inch 4K QD-OLED one, marketed to perfection as the… MPG 272URX QD-OLED. (Sure, why not!)

<p>The best thing about the start of a new year isn't the goal-setting or the aspirational self-improvement — it's watching Awesome Games Done Quick.

<p>The 8Bitdo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is on sale via Amazon for just $29. This is a record low price and represents a discount of 36 percent. That’s a pretty good deal, especially when considering that first-party Xbox controllers are around $60.</p>

<p>You can now play <em>Jeopardy!</em> on your Fire TV Stick. Volley, the developer of the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-09-amazon-echo-jeopardy.html">Alexa version</a> of the game show, launched a new edition for Amazon’s streaming device on Thursday. Unlike the voice assistant edition, this one lets you see the clues onscreen, which I have to imagine makes it much more enjoyable. Of course, you also get a familiar view of the 60-year-old show’s iconic game board.</p> 
<p>The game is only available through the developer’s new Volley Games app for Fire OS, which requires a $13 monthly subscription. <em>Jeopardy!</em> is exclusively voice-powered, apart from holding the voice button on the Alexa Voice Remote when you want to answer (in the form of a question, of course).</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>At 4K and 27 inches, pixel density clocks in at 165 pixels per inch, meaning the G81SF should produce an incredibly sharp image.

<p>Individuals or groups that want to be able to verify others must already have an official bot verified by Telegram. Once that happens, they can apply to become a third-party verifier on Telegram. They&#39;re also required to have a unique icon (simple and. minimalistic in a solid color) that will appear next of the names of accounts they verify.&nbsp;</p>

Picking our favorite villains in 2024 was challenging when it simply wasn’t a great time for tech. With the depressing spiral that is social media, the will-they-or-won’t-they dance of banning TikTok in the US and the neverending edited and deepfaked content, it’s just so noisy. Is it the internet of slop? Is it exhaustion? Is it AIs talking to AIs about AIs? In between all that, there’s the obsolescence of connectors past, Intel’s major struggles to turn around its fortunes, and, ugh, those AI assistants.</p>
