## Why Did The Nice Guys (2016) Not Become An Iconic Comedy?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Nice Guys (2016) is by far the funniest movie I’ve seen released in the last 10 years. The movie is well reviewed, had an immensely popular lead (Gosling) along with a familiar Hollywood legend (Crowe) yet it doesn’t seem to have reached the fame or icon status of a Superbad or The Hangover. In fact, it sold so poorly that they didn’t even make a sequel. I guess my question is why? And is the transcendent, blockbuster comedy movie dead?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Top_Use2413"> /u/Top_Use2413 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hs6jew/why_did_the_nice_guys_2016_not_become_an_iconic/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hs6jew/why_did_the_nice_guys_2016_not_become_an_iconic/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I rewatched <em>A Bug&#39;s Life</em> recently. I haven&#39;t seen it in literally over twenty years. It has a story about being true to yourself, finding your way, worker explotation, bullying, etc but it&#39;s nothing too deep for a film, especially a family film.</p> <p>It felt refreshing. It&#39;s not a tearjerker. It doesn&#39;t have a super strong commentary about life. It&#39;s just a fun film to watch.</p> <p>As a kid, I always wanted a sequel. I would think &quot;Why did Toy Story get so many sequels and not it?&quot;. As an adult, I realize there&#39;s really no need for a sequel. It&#39;s self-contained. Pixar could do stuff set in the bug&#39;s world or make shorts about the circus bugs, but there&#39;s no need.</p> <p>Pixar struggles with the weight of their success. Everyone expects their films to be top-tier, 10/10. They have a reputation for some of the best CGI animation in the industry, and some of the sweetest family geared films a

However, I am always questioning my ability to tell if Nicolas Cage movies are good or not, because he is so hit or miss...

In the first, the man of the family is standing in front of a mirror, and after a few seconds, his reflection moves differently, with a sinister grin. At the end of this scene, the reflection tries to trap the man inside the mirror.</p> <p>The second scene is the finale (spoiler), where the father of the family is shown being taken away in an ambulance because he’s dead. However, as the ambulance drives away, the camera focuses on the family, and you can see the same man with the same sinister grin from the previous scene, hinting that the spirit had managed to escape from the ho

Genuinely the best drama about relationships I’ve seen in a while. Watching two extremely flawed characters, people from broken homes, fall in and out of love with each other was just heartbreaking yet completely understandable. It was inevitable, it was never going to work but it still was painful to watch. Familiar to so many people whether through first hand or second hand experience. Childhood trauma, different communication styles, different styles for dealing with emotions, different outlooks on life, ambitions and love that just could never last.
