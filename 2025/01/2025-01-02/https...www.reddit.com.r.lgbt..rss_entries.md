To the point where I wrote down everyone I could think of and asked my friends who they knew and it applied to 19/31, with R and T names being tied for second with two people each. It seems to apply to everyone regardless of what they were assigned at birth, and variants of Aidan, Alice, Andre, Anthony, and Avery were the most common names overall. I‚Äôve also noticed that on name suggestion posts the most popular suggestions also tend to start with the letter A, or that the person in question just has A-name vibes. Is there any particular reason for this, or is it just complete happenstance? Or have I (21F in the Midwest) just somehow managed to locate and befriend every A-named person in a 30 miles radius? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Professional-Milk204"> /u/Professional-Milk204 </a> <br/> <

Only my mum knows out of my family, and she was alright with it, but i know my dad&#39;s side is not particularly allies, to put it lightly. A different aunt (not blood related) told my mum that my dads sister (the aunt in question) is seeing a woman. Now, this might not sound like a lot, but it genuinly made me tear up with joy. I&#39;ve always been compared to that aunt growing up, and now the fact that we both might be gay makes me so happy. For years I always felt a bit alone in the family considering I never thought I&#39;d tell anyone, but now that someone else might actually be part of the lgbt it feels like we&#39;re in it together? I doubt she would know that I know, and I don&#39;t know if she will ever know I am bi either. Either way, this still felt like some very special news to me. I don&#39;t even know how to describe it. Anyone else have similar stories/experiences?</p> </
