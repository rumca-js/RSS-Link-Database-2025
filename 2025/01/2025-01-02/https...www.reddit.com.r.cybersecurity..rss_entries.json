We have sensitive secrets within our business, and we need a robust access control mechanism.</p> <p>Ideally, users with a specific &quot;leader&quot; role should be able to request access to these secrets. However, access should only be granted if <em>at least two other authorized users</em> approve the request. This is essentially a delegated permission system with a mandatory approval step.</p> <p>Currently, our organization uses Bitwarden, Infisical, and AWS Secrets Manager. Unfortunately, none of these seem to natively support this specific workflow.</p> <p>Does anyone have recommendations for secrets management tools that offer this kind of approval-based access control? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",

Right now, they have to log in every time they move to a new workstation, which is super inefficient.</p> <p>We\u2019re exploring options like YubiKeys, smart cards, or something similar that allows them to log in quickly on any computer. We looked into Windows Hello, but it doesn\u2019t seem to support multiple users logging into shared devices well.</p> <p>Has anyone tackled this before? Would love any recommendations or advice on tools that are secure, easy to use, and good for a healthcare setting.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PlayfulVirus3771\"> /u/PlayfulVirus3771 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hrhqsm/best_way_to_simplify_physician_logins_across/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/",
