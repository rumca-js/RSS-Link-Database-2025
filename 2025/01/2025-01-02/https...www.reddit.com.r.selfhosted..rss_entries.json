In the event, one node goes down, one of the other 2 nodes will take over routing traffic, then defer back to the &#39;master&#39; node when it comes back online. Is this accurate and achievable?</p> <p>With this in mind, would PFSense, or OpnSense handle this high availability config better?

Whether you\u2019re using Overseerr, Jellyseerr, Radarr, or Sonarr, ListSync is here to save you a bit of hassle. </p> <hr/> <h3><strong>Why ListSync?</strong></h3> <p>Like a few others, I ran into a frustrating issue with Radarr, Sonarr, Jellyseerr &amp; Overseerr. The ability to simply import third party lists of content. Be it IMDB or Trakt lists etc.</p> <p>ListSync automates the process of fetching your watchlists, searching for media on your server, and requesting anything that\u2019s missing. This fills in a big gap in the jellyfin pipeline, it\u2019s designed to be straightforward, flexible, and a bit of a time-saver. </p> <hr/> <h3><strong>\u2728 Key Features</strong></h3> <p>Here\u2019s what makes ListSync worth a look",
