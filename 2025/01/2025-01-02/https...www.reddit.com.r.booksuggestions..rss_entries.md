I started my reading journey last year with a lot of romantasy books which I really really enjoyed at the time (and was totally gripped by them!) but now when I read similar books I&#39;m bored and finding myself rolling my eyes at the constant tropes. </p> <p>I enjoy fantasy (and sci-fi to a lesser degree), the last books that totally had me were the Red Rising books. I loved how there was always something happening, how you really got to know and love the characters and the story was really interesting. I found myself pulled in by the real feeling consequences that the characters had and found myself really rooting for them and getting emotional throughout. I&#39;m currently trying to get through Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Cosmere and I&#39;m enjoying them but I find them really slow going and finding them a bit of a slog at times. </p> <p>Any b

It seemed like one of those futuristic ideas that belonged more to science fiction than to reality. However, as I immersed myself in the world of technology, I began to understand that it wasn&#39;t just a dream: AI was already here, and it was changing the way we lived and worked.</p> <p>I remember the day I opened my smartphone and noticed how much the voice assistant had improved. &quot;Hey, assistant!&quot; I exclaimed. With a simple command, I received answers to complex questions, booked restaurants, and even checked the weather. It was like having a little personal assistant always at my disposal. That was the first time I realized how powerful AI could be in everyday life.</p> <p>As I began to explore these possibilities, I discovered new applications, from time management apps to instant translation systems.

I&#39;m currently trying to get back into reading but struggling to find where to start. Before I read lots of YA fantasy that was set in modern day earth. Books\series like the The Alchemyst by Michael Scott, Fablehaven by Brandon Mull, and Percy Jackson were always my favorite. I&#39;m struggling to find more adult books with the same vibe of magic\mythology in the present day Earth. I would love some recommendations if anyone has any!

I’ve re-edited the stories into easy-to-understand language tailored for a modern-day audience, while still preserving their timeless charm.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your feedback or any suggestions you might have on how I can improve or what stories you’d like to see next.</p> <p>Not sure if links are allowed here, but if you search Timeless Tales Reimagined on YouTube, you should be able to find my channel.</p> <p>Thanks for your time and thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Spatial_Nomad"> /u/Spatial_Nomad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hrust8/feedback_wanted_modern_audiobook_renditions_of/">[link]<

However, most of the stories I’ve read recently have had very sparse description and are more plot focused. And while I like the stories on their own merit, it’s not the tone I have in mind for my own stories, which makes it hard to find inspiration in these stories</p> <p>Looking for something with very specific and descriptive prose/imagery (the weirder the better; I loved the prose in Gods of Want by K-Ming Chang for reference if anyone has read that). I also love it when authors play with character voice, form, style, POV, tense, etc</p> <p>Preferably with morally gray characters, complex relationships between characters. By less plot-focused, I mean that the main events in the short stories should generally come from the characters themselves, not external factors (e.g. earthquake). I don’t even really care if there
