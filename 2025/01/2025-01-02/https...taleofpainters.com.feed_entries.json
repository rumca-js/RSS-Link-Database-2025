        "description": "<p>This is my up-to-date list of the best miniature paints I tested. Over the years, I tested over a thousand paints from (almost) all miniature paint manufacturers out there. So the ultimate question is: Which acrylic paint range is the best for painting Warhammer miniatures in 2025? To answer this question, I compiled a list sorted by categories. Best acrylics, best metallic paints, best washes, and best airbrush paints.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/01/stahlys-best-miniature-paints-warhammer-2024/\">Stahly&#8217;s best miniature paints for Warhammer 2024/2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
