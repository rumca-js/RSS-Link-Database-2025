Grand Theft Auto 6 could rake in billions in just its first year on sale, with some analysts predicting $3 billion, outpacing GTA 5's sales. If you can't wait to drop $70 on GTA 6, maybe these (sort of) free PS Plus games can hold you over. January's offerings include The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. And finally, Kanye West has revealed his recent gaming habits, and they include Naughty Dog's award-winning The Last of Us Part 2.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe had one of the biggest hits of the year with Deadpool & Wolverine, but Sony bombed twice at the box office with Madame Web and Kraven the Hunter, though Venom: The Last Dance performed well. On the comics side, Marvel really leaned into the relaunched Ultimate line with Ultimate Black Panther, Ultimate X-Men, and more. 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year for the House of Ideas, with several new MCU films including the highly-anticipated Fantastic Four: First Steps, the return of Daredevil in a new Disney+ show, and more. In comics, One World Under Doom kicks off in February. Several Marvel video games will be bowing in 2025, such as the Captain America/Black Panther WW2 game, the mysterious Wolverine title from Insomniac, and a lot more.\n\n#IGN #Marvel #MCU",
