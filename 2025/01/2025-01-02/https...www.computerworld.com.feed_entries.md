<p>Apple has already told us that achieving better health through better choices is fundamental to its approach. “Our goal is to empower people to take charge of their own health journey,” <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/06/apple-provides-powerful-insights-into-new-areas-of-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said Dr. Sumbul Desai</a>, Apple’s vice president of health, in 2023. </p>
