<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone! I&#39;m starting on Linux, or trying to. I did some searches and find that I can play a lot of games that I want, but not my favorite (ignore that fact), League of Legends.

If I can, I&#39;m all in Pop_OS, cause is the only thing that miss on my &quot;check&quot; To change from Windows to Linux</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Equal_Opinion7768"> /u/Equal_Opinion7768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hs6ljm/trying_to_start_on_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hs6ljm/trying_to_start_on_linux/">[comments]</a></span>

## Computer crashing more frequently since switching to Linux

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been having this crash where my monitors go black, the entire system is unresponsive, but the computer power stays on and the fans keep running. Eventually, after about two or three minutes, the whole thing either shuts down or restarts. There does not seem to be any pattern to whether it shuts down entirely, or restarts.</p> <p>This crash only happens while playing certain games, and <em>usually after about 45-90 minutes of playtime</em>, if not more. The worst offenders are Hell Let Loose and Civilization VI. It would not do it at all with others, such as Cities: Skylines. After doing some digging, I am fairly certain the issue is with my processor. The ntoskrnl.exe crash, I figured, could be fixed by a switch over to Linux - something I used to run and wanted to go back to anyways. I was running Windows 10 up until yesterday.</p> <p>Cut to today - I finally make the switch and install Mint (Cinnamon 22), and it seems to be running fine. T

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently bought the collectors edition of the game and installed it through Steam. I have it running through Proton GE 9.22 on Bazzite. It seems to run ok, no real performance issues. My problem is that I wanted to check out the game before spending any money on it, so I tried through Xbox Game Pass on my Series X. The game is supposed to support signing into your Xbox account for cloud saves and achievements, but every time I hit the option in the game menu, it just automatically says it failed to connect to an account, without ever asking me to sign in. I&#39;ve done some searching, and I can&#39;t find anyone saying that they&#39;ve had this issue, nor how to fix it. Anyone have any thoughts? I appreciate the help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/smitskinor"> /u/smitskinor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hs513x/indiana_jones_tgc_xbox_account_problem/

When I installed it, opening the game resulted in my entire system freezing. I can still move my mouse, and audio still plays but i cant interact with the desktop, cant alt tab etc. I ended up deleting all my config files, and that left me with the default settings. I got all my binds/configurations back up, but when I tried to increase my video settings, my system did the same thing. If anyone could help, it would be appreciated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Running Arch Linux on a laptop with an RTX 4060 and KDE (wayland). Running a game through Steam on the built in screen (2560x1600@165hz) works just fine. I connected the laptop to an external monitor (1920x1080@144hz) through an official Steam Deck dock through USB-C and was able to operate the KDE userspace and applications just fine. However when I attempt to display a game from Steam, the external monitor loses any signal. I&#39;m able to recreate this with more than one game. I don&#39;t believe it is a refresh rate issue because the same issue is present when I set both monitors to 60hz. I&#39;ve also attempted switching between Optimus hybrid graphics and using just the NVIDIA card. I&#39;m using proprietary NVIDIA drivers and the Flatpak version of Steam.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently bought Shenmue I &amp; II on Steam and was playing it on Windows. Like many console ports of old ass games, the engine is hard-limited to 30fps. However, upon investigation I found that 60fps can be achieved with frame generation/interpolation using <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/">Lossless Scaling</a>. Of course, this tool is only available on Windows.</p> <p>I want to know if there is a similar tool or a set of ridiculous launch options I could use to get a similar effect on Linux, as I play a lot of old games like this but I am a snob and can&#39;t stand 30fps, but every time I boot into Windows I feel like I lose a bit of my soul and would like to avoid it as much as possible.</p> <p>I know frame generation is possible with FSR 3.1, but I am not aware if it needs to be manually integrated into the game or not. I have an RTX 3080 so if it is possible with DLSS somehow, that would work for me too.</p>
