Is this allowed? Or do you have to encounter the virus before you can cure it? As we had cured it and there were not any black cubes on the board, we also eradicated it, before encountering it (which felt a bit odd)? </p> <p>2) Do the event cards count towards your 7 card count limit?</p> <p>3) Are you able to discard cards when it is not your go? Say for example, another player shares knowledge with me, and gives me a card for the city we&#39;re in, but I have 7 cards already, am I able to discard one of my cards to create room for the card ",

So can you bribe with those cards?

For example, a player offered their property card to the sheriff as a bribe. It was their only property card and it was a really good one. The sheriff offered to give them a couple dollars to make it a better deal. To me, that\u2019s not a bribe anymore, that\u2019s trading with the sheriff. The sheriff can\u2019t give anything away.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Im trying to find the name of a boardgame I used to play a couple of years ago. From what I&#39;ve gather it resembles a game called Overpower slightly. It has a deck of cards of monsters/creatures with strong attacks and busted abilities. </p> <p>I played with 8 friends. Each player would be given 2 cards face up on the table and 2 dice. On your turn you&#39;d roll your 2 dice and depending on what faces they land on your cards could potentially use their moves. The roll would be applied for everyone at the table. So if you rolled a 2, and you and another player had an attack that required a 2 then you could both use your respective attacks. The person who rolled the dice would be the first to make their move and the order of attacks would follow in a clockwise direction.</p> <p>When attacking the person says the name of the move, chooses a player they wish to attack and which monster.

First, for the Federation missions, which don&#39;t have a play from the table concept like the Borg, is it a one shot and done type of thing? Ie you activate the mission, do your skills test, and if you fail and opt not to reroll, you fail the mission?</p> <p>Second, how many moves do you take for the turbolift? I view walking into the turbolift and moving to the other turbolift as one move, but a video I watched split it into two. </p> <p>Third, the stun regeneration. Are we waiting for a special card or is that just an action we take?</p> <p>Last, if we acquire an expansion pack, do we also need go acquire another box set for a three player game, or is the expansion pack enough?</p> <p>I&#39;m sure I have more, but those are just the ones that jump out at me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",
