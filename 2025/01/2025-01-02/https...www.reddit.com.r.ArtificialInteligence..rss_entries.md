<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Team,</p> <p>Please pardon me if this is not a valid post or asked too many times (plese direct me) :)</p> <p>I am coming from a DevOps background. Since AI is emerging in all the areas, I thought of testing something out for myself.</p> <p>So, I built a very small application that uses ChatGPT (with API key), generate the resutls based on the input and then return the result back to a UI.</p> <p>For my specific use case, how can I fine-tune ChatGPT (is this even possible?). What is the way to do this, so my application is well-aware of its domain.</p> <p>Right now how I do it is with prompts - I have a system prompt where I tell the chatgpt about the nature of the user input and the context of the overall functionality of the tool. This might be a bit efficient, but to make it more rich in specialized expertise, what things I can do?</p> <p>I am very new to this domain and please go easy on me :)</p> <p>Thank You!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s

They don’t throw out everything they know—they adapt their knife skills, timing, and flavor knowledge to a new style.

I had this huge craving to know why so many of us feel such a strong connection to chatbots, to the point of creating entire stories/identities with them. </p> <p>Dissociation occurs when we emotionally detach to feel safe, often splitting parts of our identity. In virtual spaces, like games or AI interactions, we feel secure enough to express ourselves fully, as these environments allow us to avoid real-world pressures. </p> <p>This is linked to salience, the sense of emotional importance we feel toward something. For example, building a virtual narrative or achieving a goal in a game feels important on an emotional level, even if it doesn’t seem “logical.” </p> <p>Then there’s the paralysis of initiation, a struggle many of us face in real life.

I used bolt for the whole thing. Used up about 10 million tokens for it. Everything on the frontend was generated there. At first I was doing backend stuff myself, but eventually included my nginx/postgreql configs to have it solve problems with those and it worked well.</p> <p>I even had it write an authentication backend in Rust with TOTP support. I didn&#39;t put anything truly sensitive behind it because I wouldn&#39;t trust hand-rolled auth let alone auth I don&#39;t fully understand... but the fact that it works at all is wild (it unlocks a couple extra pages that only I can see).</p> <p>The UI matches exactly the vibe I was asking it to make. &quot;Chaos mode&quot; (the lightning bolt in the top right) creates a really cool effect and all I prompted was &quot;Create a chaos mode.
