I had never before played anything made by this director, neither did I know anything about the lore surrounding his games.</p> <p>I played it on the Switch, and I must say that it is a fantastic port, so if you&#39;re wondering whether it is worth it on the platform, I can recommend it without a doubt. It is up there with ports like DOOM (2016) or Skyrim in my opinion.</p> <p>That being said, let&#39;s start. I have decided to review each aspect of the game separately, due to the fact that my opinions vary greatly between them.</p> <h1>Music</h1> <p>First off, I want ",

For reference, from <a href=\"https://suikoden.fandom.com/wiki/Cook-off_Minigame\">its wiki</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hai Yo [NPC] and Riou [protagonist] have to make a three course meal (appetizer, main course, and a dessert) for a panel of four judges [NPCs]. The host of the game will introduce the judges, often giving hints at what kind of food they like. The judges score each meal on a scale of 0 to 5 and the team with the highest score wins. Hai Yo receives the opponent&#39;s prized recipe for winning and could end up losing the Moon Bird Recipe should he be defeated.</p> </blockquote> <p>You&#39;d collect recipes and ingredients through the course of Suikoden 2.
