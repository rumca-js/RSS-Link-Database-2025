This talk aims to revolutionise how you think about the performance of associative operations.\n\nAssociative iteration is a powerful technique that allows for efficient computation of associative operations (addition, multiplication, and other monoids) in `O(log(N))` time as opposed to `O(N)` time.\n\nThe name for this technique was coined by my collaborators, and it is my goal to share their insights about it. \n\nAssociative Iteration is an absurdly general technique that leverages the properties of associativity that when combined with parallelism can achieve outstanding performance with very little effort.\n\nWe define Associative Iteration (unrelated to \"iterators\" as you might expect) as the repeated application of some associative operation with respect ",
