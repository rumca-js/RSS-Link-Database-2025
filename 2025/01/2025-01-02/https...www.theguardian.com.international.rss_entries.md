<p>This result will have no bearing on the destination of this season’s Scottish Premiership. A Celtic lead that remains at 11 points says all we need to know about that.

A three-goal winning margin perfectly depicted the flow of this fixture. Brendan Rodgers will remember what is only his second Old Firm defeat. Rarely are Celtic outplayed in such a manner domestically. Here, they were ragged and rattled throughout.

Not round enough to come across overly tidy, not odd enough to appear chosen at random, 2025 sounds like a clear interval: a turning point, a historical marker, or possibly a deadline. It could well turn out to be any or all of those things, though the outlook feels less futuristically ambiguous than anti-futuristically bleak at the moment.</p><p>Is there a chance that humanity can back away from frighteningly destructive and relentless wars, rollbacks of human rights, and insistence on having some kind of debate about what kind of medical care works (vaccines) and doesn’t (denying people medical coverage)?

On the one hand, it has happened billions and billions of times in the course of human history and it has been successful in a wide range of settings, from neolithic caves to state-of-the-art hospitals. On the other, it is objectively dangerous in many cases.</p><p>This tension can be felt in much of the modern popular discourse on birth. On my Instagram feed, there are depictions of unmedicated home births in a bathtub surrounded by flowers and a caption about how birth has got too medicalised. Some commenters are quick to note that, in their case, having that medical help was life-saving. To put it most starkly: yes, people have been giving birth at home for millions of years, but a lot of them died.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/02/truth-p

<p>There are few rituals I despise more than the annual January catalog of joyless, dutiful aspirations. This year, I’m saying no</p><p>As the Christmas lights flicker off across the country and gift wrap is crumpled into trash bags the world over, we are about to collectively turn from the festive, indulgent holiday season to its more stringent coda. We are leaving the season of eat, drink and be merry, and entering an annual time of smug righteousness, virtuous self-denial and ostentatiously effortful self-discipline. Christmas is over. It is time, now, for new year resolutions.</p><p>Allow me to be blunt in saying that there are few rituals I despise more than this, the annual January catalog of joyless, dutiful aspirations.

<p>The French president’s failures offer an object lesson in what happens when liberalism is stripped of its morality and values</p><p>When Emmanuel Macron was first elected in the spring of 2017<strong>,</strong> we were told that he was the future of liberal pluralism. The BBC said his victory was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3s_PogR-cc&amp;t=24s&amp;ab_channel=BBCNews">a repudiation of the populist, antiestablishment wave</a>”<strong> </strong>of that time. He was “<a href="https://time.com/emmanuel-macron-president-france-interview/">the next leader of Europe</a>” according to a Time Magazine cover.

<p>The tourists must pick the best possible XI as decline of Virat Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma is laid clear against Australia</p><p>Australian tours have a habit of making or breaking Test careers. VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid destroyed Australia’s world-record winning streak at Kolkata in 2001, overcoming one of the greatest teams and its champion bowlers Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. By 2012, Australia’s home grounds ended Laxman and Dravid, four Tests across the country returning a pair of half-centuries and bringing two fine careers to a deflating close against the more modest threat of Ben Hilfenhaus and Nathan Lyon.</p><p>Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were two more declining champions who creaked through that tour and were managed out of the side by the following year.
