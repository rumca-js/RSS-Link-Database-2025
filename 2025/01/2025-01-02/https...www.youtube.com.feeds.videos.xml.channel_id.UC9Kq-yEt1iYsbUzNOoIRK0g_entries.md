Netflix has been churning out movies for years, with a common critique being that they’re somewhat derivative of other movies. Well Carry-On is here to challenge that narrative by being a holiday action movie that takes place in an airport on Christmas Eve. Wait, that’s Die Hard 2. Well dang it. 

Carry-On does raise some questions. Like how is Ethan never at his post? How does that Watcher guy manage to get the perfect line of sight from a parking garage? Did the Traveler’s entire plan rely on Ethan checking his phone while at work?
