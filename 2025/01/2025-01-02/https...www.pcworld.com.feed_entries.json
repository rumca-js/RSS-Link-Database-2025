While conventional screens hit the 500Hz refresh mark <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446541/face-melting-500hz-monitors-are-a-thing-now-my-body-is-ready.html\">a couple of years ago</a>, fancy-pants OLED monitors haven\u2019t quite reached such speeds yet. MSI intends to do so sometime in 2025, along with a couple of other OLED firsts announced before CES 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That monitor is the <a href=\"https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-272QR-QD-OLED-X50/Specification\">MPG 272QR QD-OLED X50</a> (woof!) with its 27-inch panel and 1440p resolution, 0.03ms response time, and that blistering 500Hz refresh rate. Oddly, MSI is positioning this screen for \u201call the mainstream gamers out there.\u201d Who considers themselves \u201cmainstream\u201d while hitting 500 frames per second at 1440p?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No pric",

(<a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677744/corsair-xeneon-flex-monitor-review.html\">That one goes to the Corsair Xeneon Flex</a>.) But it <em>is</em> the first monitor that\u2019s both 5K2K (what?) and bendable, so bully for LG, I suppose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LG UltraGear 45GX990A is a 45-inch OLED display with a 21:9 aspect ratio and an impressive 5120\u00d72160 resolution. That\u2019s indeed a little wider than your standard 4K screen, stretching out the usual 16:9 ratio into the semi-standard \u201cultrawide\u201d form factor, with a huge upgrade in both physical size and usable resolution versus the more typical 3440\u00d71440 configuration.
