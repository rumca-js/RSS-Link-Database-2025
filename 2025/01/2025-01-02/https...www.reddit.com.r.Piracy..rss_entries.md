<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I really, really hate adds, especially on devices that I purchased. I&#39;ve been living without a TV for around 15 years, just watching pirated movies on my PC. I love uBlockOrigin and recently moved to Firefox, since Google is adamant on making their user experience miserable. That being said, I&#39;m looking to buy a TV because I&#39;d like to watch movies with my family, and it&#39;s not comfortable on a 27&quot; computer monitor. I&#39;d like to watch YT without adds, as well as movies that I could play from a hard drive connected to my router, or from my PC, or from my phone via BT, or from a drive connected directly to the TV, in that order preferably, and with subtitles. AFAIK, I need an Android / Google TV OS, since it can run SmartTube (old name SmartTubeNext), an app that blocks ads on YT, so that would cover it. Now, which brands or models do you guys use that would support playing movies?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey yall, HS senior here who&#39;s going to college in about 8 months. So obviously all colleges have the &quot;no piracy policy&quot; where obviously you cannot pirate copyrighted media on their devices or wifi, and if you do you&#39;ll get a cease and desist or something. However, I&#39;m a simple man when it comes to this; i usually just go to some free film streaming site (stuff like movies joy) and just stream video instead of torrenting. </p> <p>I have an unlimited data plan, so if I were to simply just use my mobile data when I wanted to stream content, is there any reasonable way then for my college to see if I&#39;m pirating stuff? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HARJAS200007"> /u/HARJAS200007 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hrpoez/would_my_college_be_able_to_see_if_i_pirate_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/co
