<p>The graphics card hype train left the station weeks before CES 2025 kicks off in early January, with the launch of Intel’s $249 Arc B580 – <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2553897/intel-arc-b580-review-worthy-budget-1440p-gpu.html">the GPU we’ve begged for since the pandemic</a>. But make no mistake: Intel decided to launch its second-gen Arc in December because CES is shaping up to be an absolute <em>banger</em> for graphics card releases.</p>
