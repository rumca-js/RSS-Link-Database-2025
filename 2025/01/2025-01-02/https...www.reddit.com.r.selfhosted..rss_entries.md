In the event, one node goes down, one of the other 2 nodes will take over routing traffic, then defer back to the &#39;master&#39; node when it comes back online. Is this accurate and achievable?</p> <p>With this in mind, would PFSense, or OpnSense handle this high availability config better? I&#39;m aware PFSense leaves a bad taste in many people&#39;s mouths, but I&#39;m looking for a strictly technical implementation perspective here.</p> <p>Thanks everyone,</p> <p>Cal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/calvadosboulard">

I assume because those places were designated by the US government as state sponsors of terrorism, or otherwise sanctioned.</p> <p>Obviously, if I’m in an oppressive regime, then that is when access to a VPN is most critical. This proved to be particularly annoying on this trip as I needed to move money around, and my bank app would straight up not let me log in.</p> <p>So what is the alternative? I like that Tailscale allows you to seamlessly connect to the VPN and turn exit nodes on and ofl I’m looking at Headscale but I’m not sure exactly how to set that up on my iDevices, though I’m sure I could get the server running - will it solve the problem?</p> <p>Or is there anything else I should be looking?

I don&#39;t want to waste money on more storage, when I already have so much. But for both aesthetic and functional reasons, I don&#39;t want just a bunch of external hard drives connected to a pc.

This would basically be a beefed-up version of the set up that I already have.</p> <p>Apologies in advance

The ability to simply import third party lists of content.

This fills in a big gap in the jellyfin pipeline, it’s designed to be straightforward, flexible, and a bit of a time-saver. </p> <hr/> <h3><strong>✨ Key Features</strong></h3> <p>Here’s what makes ListSync worth a look

I&#39;d like something simple, as I don&#39;t think what I require is very complex, just TLS with a signed server certificate (no certbot/ACME or wildcards), and navigate to apps as host.fqdn.com/app1 or host.fqdn.com/app2 etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GhostHacks"> /u/GhostHacks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hrkb8j/alternative_proxy_for_docker_containers_to_traefik/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1

My network exposure is I think pretty well secured, but I&#39;m hoping for a second opinion. </p> <p>All my docker service ports are internal only, shared with my wireguard server instance&#39;s network for accesibility.</p> <p>The only two ports exposed from my router is 443 to the docker server, which points to my NGINX Proxy Server Instance and the port for my Wireguard VPN. Proxy rules require I be connected to the public IP at my home, or to my wireguard VPN. There are no user login options around this. (My current router is an Eero setup that I have access to via multiple personal devices if I ever need to access another port for maintenance) All domains are covered SSL encrypted through LetsEncrypt Keys.</p> <p>It seems fairly secure to me, but what am I missing? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt
