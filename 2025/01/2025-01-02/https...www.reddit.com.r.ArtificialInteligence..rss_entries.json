Since AI is emerging in all the areas, I thought of testing something out for myself.</p> <p>So, I built a very small application that uses ChatGPT (with API key), generate the resutls based on the input and then return the result back to a UI.</p> <p>For my specific use case, how can I fine-tune ChatGPT (is this even possible?). What is the way to do this, so my application is well-aware of its domain.</p> <p>Right now how I do it is with prompts - I have a system prompt where I tell the chatgpt about the nature of the user input and the context of the overall functionality of the tool. This might be a bit efficient, but to make it more rich in specialized expertise, what things I can do?</p> <p>I am very new to this domain and please go easy on me :)</p> <p>Thank You!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",
