For context, I\u2019d love to read more fantasy any I lean more toward literary fiction and character-driven books, and weigh the world building/plot elements less heavily (does that even make sense?? lol). For example, I really liked everything by Guy Gavirel Kay, Jonathan Strange, Piransei, Hands of the Emperor, Bujold, but not Sanderson, Robin Hobb (not sure why she didn\u2019t click!), or urban fantasy/grimdark. Anyone else with similar taste who could share some recs, likely older ones, assuming I\u2019ve checked out the standard recs in this space?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway456999678\"> /u/throwaway456999678 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hrxcsb/book_recs_for_the_new_year/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hrxcsb/book_recs_for_th",

Basically from what I&#39;ve heard, I feel like this has the potential to become one of my favorite series, or maybe even my favorite of all time. I love good prose, the focus on one character throughout his life, and the melancholic emotional destruction and heartbreaking feelings the books are said to give you. I did kind of struggle to love book one that much, but I heard it gets better so I am excited to continue. I heard book two is way better, and the series mostly just gets better and better. But I also just finished Wind and Truth, Stormlight 5, so the shift in tone from that to this feels a lot slower and boring at times. Basically what I&#39;m asking for is, for superfans of this series to just gush about it for me, and tell me what this series means to you,",

Ever since I read the prologue I knew this was going to be completely different than Echoes Saga and there I say better? The prologue really set the stage for me, putting me in a new environment with a race I know nothing about and seeing how different they are compared to the characters we saw in Echoes. This story is different to Echoes this isn&#39;t Echoes Saga just in the past. This feels more grander in scope comparable to Wheel of Time more so than even Echoes achieved. </p> <p>Once There Were Heroes is a modern fantasy epic. Inspired by the past and bringing something new and highly enjoyable that makes you pull all nighters to read just one more chapter.

So far I&#39;m only one chapter in, but I noticed there are significant portions of the Chinese version that don&#39;t seem to be translated in the English version. For instance, the Chinese version has Guo Xiaotian, Yang Tiexin and the storyteller holding an extended and detailed conversation about the history and lore of the wars between the Song and the Jin dynasty, mentioned several emperors, ministers and generals by name and talking about their deeds. The corresponding English version omits much of this conversation and doesn&#39;t mention any of those figures by name, only glossing them as corrupt men of the court.
