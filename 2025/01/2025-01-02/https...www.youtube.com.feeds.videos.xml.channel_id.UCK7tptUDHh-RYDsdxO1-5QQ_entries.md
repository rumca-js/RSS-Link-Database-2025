Cruise lines like MSC Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Lines are pouring increasing sums into private islands that give them more control over the guest experience. Nearly 13 million tourists went on Caribbean cruises in 2013, but there are only so many ports they can visit. Because of increasingly large crowds in places like Nassau, new destinations like Ocean Cay in the Bahamas have become increasingly important. 

WSJ explores how MSC spent $500 million transforming a dredging site into an exclusive destination for its passengers.
