Unfortunately, the book ends on a cliffhanger that cuts the story off right before the moment that the whole plot has been building up to. So of course, I check the library for the second book, <em>Fall of Hyperion</em>, and there&#39;s 40 holds in line before me. I didn&#39;t want to wait a month to keep reading, so I just bought a copy of <em>Fall of Hyperion</em>. The clerk at the bookstore mentioned to me that I was buying the second book and should get the first one instead. I told her that I&#39;d already read the first book and usually start new series by checking them out at the library.</p> <p>After saying that out loud, I found myself curious when the last time I bought a first book was and couldn&#39;t recall.
