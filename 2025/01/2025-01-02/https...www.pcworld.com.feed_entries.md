<p>When it comes to PC gaming monitors, there’s no such thing as too fast. While conventional screens hit the 500Hz refresh mark <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1446541/face-melting-500hz-monitors-are-a-thing-now-my-body-is-ready.html">a couple of years ago</a>, fancy-pants OLED monitors haven’t quite reached such speeds yet. MSI intends to do so sometime in 2025, along with a couple of other OLED firsts announced before CES 2025.</p>



<p>That monitor is the <a href="https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-272QR-QD-OLED-X50/Specification">MPG 272QR QD-OLED X50</a> (woof!) with its 27-inch panel and 1440p resolution, 0.03ms response time, and that blistering 500Hz refresh rate. Oddly, MSI is positioning this screen for “all the mainstream gamers out there.” Who considers themselves “mainstream” while hitting 500 frames per second at 1440p?</p>

<p>It might be cringeworthy to be an unpaid cheerleader for an electronics company, but as a PC nerd, even I can’t deny the appeal of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/819800/grid-studio-framed-gadgets-review.html">classic electronics framed and presented like pieces of art</a>. Throw in a bit of autographed scarcity and it becomes irresistible.</p>



<p>That’s the idea behind Nvidia’s newest promotion, wherein CEO Jensen Huang will sign framed versions of the company’s classic graphics cards. <a href="https://x.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1874485747605999805">So sayeth a pre-CES tweet</a> from the official GeForce promotional account, showing off the first giveaway.</p>



<p>The framed GeForce 256 from 1999 — “the world’s first GPU” — bears Huang’s John Hancock on the backing. Its artistic and intrinsic value is surely debatable, as is that claim of be

## LG’s newest OLED monitor is ‘5K2K’ of bendy panel goodness

<p>Electronics manufacturers love to tout “world’s first” in their marketing. Take LG’s newest OLED monitor, for example. It isn’t the first display with 5K resolution, nor the first that can bend from flat to curved. (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1677744/corsair-xeneon-flex-monitor-review.html">That one goes to the Corsair Xeneon Flex</a>.) But it <em>is</em> the first monitor that’s both 5K2K (what?) and bendable, so bully for LG, I suppose.</p>



<p>The LG UltraGear 45GX990A is a 45-inch OLED display with a 21:9 aspect ratio and an impressive 5120×2160 resolution. That’s indeed a little wider than your standard 4K screen, stretching out the usual 16:9 ratio into the semi-standard “ultrawide” form factor, with a huge upgrade in both physical size and usable resolution versus the more typical 3440×1440 configuration. Like the previously mentione
