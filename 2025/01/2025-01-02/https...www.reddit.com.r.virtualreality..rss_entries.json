Any extra input lag is a killer for my application.</p> <p>Reverb G2 is out since I don&#39;t want to deal with Win10 and WMR, plus finding a good example is harder.</p> <p>I&#39;m leaning heavily towards the Pico Neo 3 Link, despite the fact people say the sweet spot is smaller. If anyone has experience with the above-mentioned headsets please chime in.</p> <",
