<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, </p> <p>I have a problem with saving articles for later in the Reeder app for iOS. When I click „Read later with Reeder” in Safari or any other news app I have the following message - „Unable to save item”. Has any of you had this issue before and know how to fix it? Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wojciu_"> /u/wojciu_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hs10ue/unable_to_save_a_link_for_later_in_reeder_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hs10ue/unable_to_save_a_link_for_later_in_reeder_app/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today (January 1) NetNews Wire has almost completely stopped picking up feeds. Yesterday it was fine, today only a couple have anything new, though there are definitely new articles that on several websites that are silent today, on Mac, iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s relevant, but I recently (over a week ago) I closed down my FeedBin account and re-subscribed to everything directly in NNW. But things have been working fine since then, until today.</p> <p>Any clues or suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/themadturk"> /u/themadturk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hrjrnf/netnewswire_not_picking_up_feeds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1hrjrnf/netnewswire_not_picking_up_feeds/">[comments]</a></span>
