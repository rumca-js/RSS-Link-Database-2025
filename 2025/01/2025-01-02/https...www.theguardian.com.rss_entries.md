<p>This dramatisation about a bereaved father’s heroic hunt for truth gets far too bogged down in detail – and fails to spark any emotion at all</p><p>There have been several documentaries about the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, most of them very good: sober, un-sensationalist but deeply moving. It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in UK history. A bomb exploded on Pan Am flight 103 as it flew over the small Scottish town. All 243 passengers and 16 crew were killed. Eleven people were killed on the ground by the debris that suddenly fell out of the night sky.</p><p>Lockerbie: A Search for Truth dramatises the story of one bereaved father’s efforts to uncover what actually happened – how the bomb got on board the flight, who put it there, which organisation was behind it, and why the UK government seemed to be obstructing his pursuit at every turn. Jim Swire (here played by Colin Firth) was a GP living with his wife, Jane, and their children in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, when the flig

<p>Graduate pay is falling – and an aggrieved generation could join white-collar workers in supporting Reform UK</p><p>What does it mean to have a middle-class, white-collar professional job?</p><p>It used to feel like a promise, a guarantee of a life that might not always run smoothly but would at least be stable, verging sometimes even on smug. It probably meant a mortgage, the kind of job title that made people trust you, and a sense – especially for those who were not born into a middle-class life – of having reached safe harbour. You wouldn’t be rich, but you’d be comfortable. Perhaps just as important, given all success is secretly relative, you would know exactly where you stood: never top of the pile, but at least a reassuringly long way off the bottom. But what happens when those layers start collapsing into each other?</p><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It took me a while to connect the dots. Maybe I was just prone to shin splints? Perhaps your calves were <em>supposed</em> to burn with every stride? Or – lightbulb moment – could it be that these post-jog aches and pains were a symptom of my wildly inappropriate footwear?</p><p>As with millions of rookie runners before me, my problems melted away when I bought myself a pair of proper running shoes.

<p>The spectre of extinction hangs over the Japanese writer’s brilliantly strange and unsettling vision of evolution</p><p>In Keepsakes, the opening section of Hiromi Kawakami’s haunting novel-in-stories, a woman describes her world. Although peaceful and orderly, it is an unsettling and strange place: people are made in factories from animal DNA, then live startlingly brief lives, growing to adulthood in a handful of years and often dying young. Memory, both personal and historical, is fragmentary and, in the case of memories of childhood, actively suppressed. Meanwhile, the society’s anxieties are focused on preserving the children the woman helps raise and the biological diversity they embody: as one of the characters declares, “If we lose the children, that’s the end of the world”.</p><p>This spectre of genetic decline and extinction stalks all 14 of the stories that make up Under the Eye of the Big Bird. In one, men – now vanishingly rare due to their genetic fragility – are&nbs

<p>After years of seemingly one-way traffic, anglicisms from ginger to kerfuffle are having their moment stateside</p><p>There is a scene in the 1999 British romcom Notting Hill that nicely illustrates the point of Gobsmacked!, a jolly account of “the British invasion of American English”. In it, Hugh Grant, a fully fledged adult, tries to scale a fence to impress Julia Roberts, and slipping, he exclaims “whoops-a-daisy!” As Britons know, “whoops-a-daisy” is a perfectly reasonable locution for an adult man to use, but it causes Roberts, an American, to bend double laughing. As it happens, “whoops-a-daisy” isn’t included in Gobsmacked!, but its collation of so many other ludicrous British terms – “kerfuffle,” “pear-shaped”, “boffin” – that have made inroads into the US will make the average Briton proud.</p><p>Ben Yagoda’s lexicon is a spin-off from his popular blog <a href="https://notoneoffbritishisms.com/">Not One-Off Britishisms</a>, an unwieldy title for a fun experiment in which
