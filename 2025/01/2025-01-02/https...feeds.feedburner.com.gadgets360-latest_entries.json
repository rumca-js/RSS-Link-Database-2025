        "description": "Apple was speculated to use 2nm chipsets to power its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models but that may not be the case anymore, according to a report. The Cupertino-based technology giant could reportedly postpone its plans by up to 12 months due to Wafer Yield issues faced by TSMC. Thus, the chips are yet to be certified for mass production and the application process (AP) period for 2nm chips for iPhone may be delayed to 2026.",
