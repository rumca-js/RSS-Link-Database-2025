<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. I am learning RISCV design and i wonder how multiple cores are implemented. I read some documents and explored some github projects but didnt get much idea.</p> <p>I wonder if its simply instantiating same core design and let programmer select which core they want to use? Is it programmers duty to handle race conditions and various hazards?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Garbage_2857"> /u/Odd_Garbage_2857 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hrxgeb/dual_core/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hrxgeb/dual_core/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, Me and a 2 other friends (we are in year 2 of electronics engineering) basically reviewed the two videos on a single cycle RISC-V microprocessor and tried implementing it following the attached diagram, we developed it in vivado and are now looking to know where all we can make improvements along with how to verify it&#39;s working and like what would be the next steps.</p> <p>We&#39;ve heard of needing to pipeline along with which comes hazard handling. But We&#39;d also like to know what areas of research can we help in and maybe develop a paper on etc etc..</p> <p>Any help appreciated.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Entenbrotz/Verilog-projects/tree/main/MIPSprocessor">GITHUB LINK OF PROJECT</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Natural-Artist1385"> /u/Natural-Artist1385 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1hrxf4p/learning_to_make_general_microprocessor/"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow Redditors,</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in exploring RISC-V development for embedded applications and have been searching for low-cost and user-friendly boards to get started. However, my search has been unsuccessful so far.</p> <p>I visited the RISC-V organization&#39;s website, but most of the boards listed are discontinued, leaving only the Banana Pi F3(<a href="https://riscv.org/developers/boards/">https://riscv.org/developers/boards/</a>), which is quite pricey. I also came across the SiFive HiFive1 Rev B board(<a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b">https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b</a>), but unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find it available in the market.</p> <p>My question is: Are there any boards similar to the SiFive HiFive1 Rev B currently available in the market? I&#39;d greatly appreciate any suggestions or recommendations from the community.</p> <p>Some follow-up questions to clarify:</p> <ul> <li>Are the
