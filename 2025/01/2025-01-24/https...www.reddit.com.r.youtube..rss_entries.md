<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try and make short and as simple as I can to not create confusion. So a while ago I created a youtube channel for the business I work for. I guess this was created basically under my own personal gmail account because the only way to access the account is if I login into my own personal google account. Obviously this doesn&#39;t work real well when you want to have other people have access to the youtube account to upload videos and such and frankly, I dont want it tied to my person account anyways. From my research I can&#39;t simply change the login to the youtube channel since it has to be linked to a google account. So I want to try and transfer the youtube channel to a different google account that isn&#39;t my own personal account. So I created a stand alone google account for my work but now I&#39;m not sure what to do from here. When I try and transfer the account, it only gives me options to transfer to another &quot;brand&quot; acc
