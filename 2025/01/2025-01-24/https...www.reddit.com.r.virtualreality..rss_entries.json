After hearing so much about the Bobovr S3 Pro and how much most people love it, I thought it was time that I gave it a try.

I know many of you will disagree but that&#39;s okay!</p> <p>This isn&#39;t to say that it isn&#39;t a nice head strap, because it definitely is. However, it just isn&#39;t for me. I found it too heavy, the fan didn&#39;t do anything noticeable, the top pads dug into my head even on the tallest setting, and as a halo strap had too much movement during active games. Then of course there is the hefty price tag. $140 in Canada. I do a lot of active and exercise games and didn&#39;t like it for those. I can see how it would be nice for just watching videos/movies, or doing less intense games though.</p> <p>Things I liked though include the following. Super-soft padding.

I really liked it at first, but it fell short of my expectations, mainly because of the FOV and graphics. So I recently bought the PSVR2 to play on my PS5, because my PC is not that good. I was really anxious and had extreme expectations, that it would be something completely different from Quest 2. I played Horizon for the first time and it was a huge disappointment, the graphics were absolutely nothing special to me, I had no sense of depth, everything was blurry, the landscape in the distance looked like a PNG, a terrible first experience. I think it was my fault for having high expectations. Can you guys tell me if GT7 l, RE and other games are more immersive? Ive played Kayak and it look even more immersive than Horizon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Creative-Pound6989\"> /u/Creative-Pound6989 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualrea",

I don\u2019t know much about brands or models, so I\u2019d appreciate any guidance.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Main Purpose</strong>: <ul> <li>Watching movies with a <em>giant screen</em> feel, but not just a static screen\u2014I\u2019d like a more immersive experience (with head tracking and similar features).</li> <li>Using it for work by creating <em>at least two virtual monitors</em> that can float on my desk.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Key Priorities</strong>: <ul> <li>High resolution is very important since I\u2019m a visual artist.</li> <li>Portability is crucial because I travel a lot. I\u2019d like to carry just my PC/laptop and the headset for a lightweight setup.</li> <li>I\u2019ll be sourcing all content and audio from my computer, so I don\u2019t need a standalone VR headset or built-in audio. I\u2019ll be using my own headphones for sound.</li> ",
