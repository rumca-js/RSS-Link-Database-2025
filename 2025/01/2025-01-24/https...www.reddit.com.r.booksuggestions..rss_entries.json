I didn\u2019t even realize that people tend to refer to the recent past by dividing it into \u201cPre/Post WWII\u201d. I\u2019m now 22 and almost done with uni (med school so my classes and courses had absolutely no way of educating me on these things) and I find myself so out of touch when it comes to so many major things that took place in the world. I feel so far away from being well-read in anything closely related to History, Socioeconomics, Politics\u2026 etc. So I\u2019d love to hear some book recommendations in these areas (not just world history) that are somewhat accessible to someone who\u2019s <em>missing a lot of context</em> in these areas.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",

Here are a few books I&#39;ve read recently and really enjoyed:</p> <p>- Demon Copperhead, mostly liked this because of the characters and how real they felt, the angst and loneliness of the main character, as well as tying in how the small towns were really being influenced by large scale corruption</p> <p>- The Stand, again mostly liked this because of all of the different characters and their unique ways of reacting to things, and how the apocalyptic scenario really brings out people&#39;s true natures</p> <p>- The Godfather, really good variety of characters and suspense, also liked the vibe of being out of the matrix of society in a sense</p> <p>- Red Notice",

I&#39;m finding 20000 leagues under the sea a bit slow and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn took me a while to get through. But now just looking for overall recommendations of good reads. </p> <p>I&#39;m a big lover of crime/ murder mysteries. Have read all of Agatha Christie&#39;s books, a few James Patterson novels too. I am also interested in some non-fiction like Prisoners of Geography and Kitchen Confidential (any more food related books I would love as recommendations). Also thoroughly enjoyed World War Z. </p> <p>Open to both fiction and non-fiction reads. Hopefully that&#39;s enough of a range to help give me some good recommendations!
