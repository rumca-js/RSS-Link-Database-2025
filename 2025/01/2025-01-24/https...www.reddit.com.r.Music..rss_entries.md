In this interview one of the callers asks him about his freestyling capabilities, and he himself states, and I quote:</p> <p>&quot;Actually I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t even really know how to do that, I got to write, I write everything.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was re-watching the performance of &#39;Never Fight a Man with a Perm&#39; by Idles, during the Mercury Prize award show in 2019, and reminded how great it is. The chaos on stage vs. the stiff setting in the room, with people all dressed up in seats, elevates the song. Despite it far from being a technically perfect performance, that dichotomy makes it one of the best ever performances at an award show that I know off.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l116zoMBl1Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l116zoMBl1Y</a></p> <p>So I was wondering, what do people regard as the best performances at award shows (be it Oscars, grammy&#39;s, any really)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jelgerw"> /u/jelgerw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i8tads/what_is_the_best_ever_musical_performance_at_an/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mus
