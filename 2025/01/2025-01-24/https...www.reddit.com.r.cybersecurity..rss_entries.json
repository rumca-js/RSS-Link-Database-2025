Some research found that just being aware of AI in your workplace can lead to negative emotions, counterproductive behavior, and even depression. It\u2019s like people feel threatened or alienated by it. Professor David De Cremer, in his study, even linked AI adoption to increasing loneliness and higher alcohol consumption. Basically, people feel disconnected because they spend less time with colleagues when AI takes over specific tasks.</p> <p>On the other side, some research shows that AI can help reduce stress and burnout. It can handle repetitive tasks, improve customer support, and even help employees feel more satisfied. There\u2019s also research on \u201cartificial empathy,\u201d where AI bridges the gap between human and machine interactions, making things like customer service feel more personal.</p> <p>So, while AI can be super helpful, it also has some pretty big risks.

I am looking at seeing if an AI-assisted (I hate myself for even typing that) ongoing and persistent vulnerability scanner/automated intermittent Pentest system is something that would benefit my network. Horizon3 has come across my radar and on the surface it looks like it might be a valuable tool to add to the Cybersecurity arsenal, but I am hoping to get some insight from current or former clients that used the service to hear their experiences and get an idea of what they were paying. We are a public K-12 district so funding is always a limiting factor in any decision, but the value of a persistent vulnerability assessment as well as the ability to target and test/retest found vulnerabilities during human pentests annually is a massive perceived benefit, but only obviously if the service is good AND affordable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alex_The_Hermi",
