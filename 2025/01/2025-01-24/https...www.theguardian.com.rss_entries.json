It is failsafe, it is free, it works on everybody. If you are average height, it&nbsp;makes you look taller. I always wanted to be taller.

I wanted the story. I wanted the intensity of it.\u201d</p><p>As he got older, that urge never quite went away. \u201cI would put myself in situations that were dark or demoralising, kind of for research, or to be able to say that I did that crazy thing,\u201d he says. In a Row, a highlight from Glory, Hadreas\u2019s new album as Perfume Genius, makes fun of that impulse, slyly skewering the idea that you have to suffer for your art: \u201cThink of all the poems I\u2019ll get out,\u201d his narrator sings, trapped in the boot of a car.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/24/perfume-genius-i-want-to-feel-extremes-but-im-not-as-self-destructive",
