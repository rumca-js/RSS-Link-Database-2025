A recent study suggests that supernova explosions, triggered by the death of early stars, could have created significant amounts of water just 100 million years after the Big Bang. Simulations of these early, massive stars show that their explosive deaths may have resulted in the formation of water molecules within the dense hydrogen and oxygen clouds they left behind. This challenges current theories about the origins of water in the universe and its role in early galaxy formation. While the presence of water in the early universe doesn't confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, it opens new questions about cosmic evolution.
