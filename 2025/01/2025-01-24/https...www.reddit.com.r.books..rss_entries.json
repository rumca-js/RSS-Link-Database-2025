I picked up this book because it claimed to be the inspiration behind The Count of Monte Cristo and Dumas&#39; other stories. I appreciate the emotions of the author to bring this story to light but unfortunately there just aren&#39;t enough historical records available about Alex Dumas to write a comprehensive story about him. The relevant information could have been wrapped up in 100 pages. On multiple occasions, I find the author speculating about the factualness of multiple narratives about an event involving Alex Dumas, without actual proof. The remaining narration about slavery in France and the French revolution whilst good to know, I would rather read from a more researched and objective POV. In most places, the author is giving his interpretation of the events, with a clear anti-Napolean bias. St",

However the character Margaret White stands out to me, not necessarily in the positive way. She is a dogmatic, overzealous, extreme, Christian fanatic who believes she is so Pious in her beliefs, to the point that it controls over emotions, thought process, and actions. However what&#39;s even more toxic is that she imparts that upon her daughter. I would not be surprised if there or real life people like that in this country, let alone this world. I&#39;m just wondering if this character is a relative accurate portrayal of them. Is Margaret really over the top, an accurate representation, or only a watered down version of the religious fundamentalists out there?
