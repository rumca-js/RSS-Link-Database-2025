<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys!</p> <p>I&#39;m getting some missing articles error and wanted to try using a new indexer</p> <p>I currently have frugal unlimited with the bonus server and a block account of <a href="http://usnews.blocknews.net">usnews.blocknews.net</a></p> <p>And for the indexers I currently have a paid subscription ninja and nzbgeek. I was thinking maybe drunk (have a free subscription) or maybe tabula rasa or nzbfinder?</p> <p>Any other recommendations are welcomed, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rafa130397"> /u/Rafa130397 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i8ua1d/recommendation_for_adding_a_new_indexer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i8ua1d/recommendation_for_adding_a_new_indexer/">[comments]</a></span>
