<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I am someone who is very passionate about web software development and I want my projects to have better quality. I want to create applications that are robust in security, authentication and that support concurrency of many users, for example a project like Amazon. What technologies would you recommend for this type of work? I want to do the backend with .NET and the frontend with Angular. What technologies are most recommended for this type of project, since I have not found quality .NET courses in Spanish.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AnyArt8874"> /u/AnyArt8874 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i8liba/tips_and_technologies_for_developing_scalable_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i8liba/tips_and_technologies_for_developing_scalable_and/">[comments]</a></span>
