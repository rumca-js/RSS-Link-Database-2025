Got expensive models from Games Workshop but you're not playing with them? It might be the rules you're playing! I'll build some lists with my Imperial Guard for two other game systems.

"Miniature Agnostic" shirt - in gothic, sci-fi, and "punk" versions - and much more at the Tabletop Minions Merch Bunker. Go to http://www.tabletopminions.org and hit "MERCH" in the menu.

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you! Use code 'FactoryUncle5' at checkout to get 5% off of your entire order at http://www.thearmypainter.com or check my favorite Army Painter products at https://thearmypainter.com/tabletop-minions

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
