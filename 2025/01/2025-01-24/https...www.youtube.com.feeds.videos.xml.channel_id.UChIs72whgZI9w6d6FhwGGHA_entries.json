The RTX 5090 FE tear down focuses on the assembly processes, ease of disassembly, and maintenance. Historically, NVIDIA's cards have had varying degrees of difficulty to dismantle. The RTX 20 series had dozens of screws, the RTX 30 series had a new approach to assembly, and the 4090 refined it. The 5090 FE seems to be NVIDIA really learning how to build a cooling solution.\n\nWatch our thermal engineering & PCB discussion! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p0MEy8BvYY\nWatch our NVIDIA RTX 5090 review & benchmarks! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWSlOC_jiLQ\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.n",
