The Los Angeles fires are some of the costliest in U.S. history. On Jan. 7, the first brush fires broke out near the Hollywood Hills and the Pacific Palisades. Strong winds grounded initial air fleets and quickly spread the wildfires. By the end of day two, firefighters were tackling multiple fires around L.A. covering more than 27,000 acres.
