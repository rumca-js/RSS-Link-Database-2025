<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen many posts throughout the years that share my sentiment on not having Photoshop on Linux, and that the alternatives aren&#39;t in one way or another filling that need. I&#39;ve realized that even if Photoshop came to Linux today, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d use it, because of Adobe. I left Windows because software these days are plagued by enshitifcation, invading your privacy, poor performance and security. Top it off with Adobe&#39;s recent nonsense around training on your data and exorbitant cancellation fees, was the final nail in the coffin for me.</p> <p>So I decided to work on my own PS-like editor that have been such a joy to write so far, but still very far off from a releasable state. I would love to work on full-time and thinking about raising some form of funding instead of working at another morally-bankrupt company.</p> <p>I know some will ask why not help out on other existing projects like Gimp.

Watching YouTube guides rarely work out, there are some that work but that&#39;s usually not the case. This time when i tried to instatll Hyprland, i wiped my KDE and started a new Archinstall, which installed a chunk of the stuff, as i followed the instructions the person opend the terminal and guided into the config to edit stuff, that&#39;s when everything became problematic as i was unable to interact with the config...i couldn&#39;t delete or write into it i was so utterly confused, so i re installed KDE tried to pretty it up, i eventually fucked up and rigged my own system, probably with the Sudo Chown command i lost all root acess with the following error that UID 1000 has acess and it should be 0,

I chose Ubuntu 22.04, as it seemed like the natural choice for someone not very familiar with the GUI side of Linux.</p> <p>Before formatting the PC, I booted it up and found it was running Ubuntu 16.04. Naturally, it had Unity as the desktop environment, and seeing it brought up some feelings. Not exactly nostalgia, but a kind of bittersweetness...</p> <p>I was already a Linux user back when Unity was officially maintained by Canonical, but at the time, I was in love with GNOME 3. I would also experiment with KDE occasionally, and besides liking GNOME, I wanted to &quot;walk with the cool kids&quot; and explore distros other than Ubuntu.</p> <p>Only years after Unity was discontinued did I begin to see its merits. The global menu and HUD are features I now truly appreciate, and the Ambiance theme was (and
