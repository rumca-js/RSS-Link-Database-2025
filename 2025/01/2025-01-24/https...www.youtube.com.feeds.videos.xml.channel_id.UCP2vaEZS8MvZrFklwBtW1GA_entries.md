Plumbing wall insulation tips…right now it’s super cold in Pittsburgh. This wall is against the garage and I used Rockwool for several reasons. It’s easy to cut and fits in tight spaces. Plus it won’t catch on fire until temperatures reach over 1000F. Most importantly it prevents frozen pipes 🥶👍🏽🔥#insulation #plumbing #bathroomrenovation #diy
