<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And I mean that in a good way. When I was younger I always viewed movies through a critic&#39;s lense. I would pay attention to details that may or may not make sense. Continuity errors. Realism. Plot details. Etc. If they checked off certain boxes (character growth, realistic action scenes if any, a flow to the plot that made sense, etc) then I would say I just watched a good movie. If not, I would just say the movie isn&#39;t good and dismiss it completely while trashing it if it ever came up in conversation. I wanted to &quot;have good taste&quot; and to me that meant it had to somewhat align with award season nominees or the general public&#39;s opinion. </p> <p>Over the past few years, though, I realize I&#39;ve been doing it wrong. I have loosened this criteria I had in my head and began to soak up movies in the way they were primarily intended...to just have fun. Yes, I can still technically recognize when a movie is doing an amazing job conve

Wouldn&#39;t the director be the one of the main driving forces behind how all of these categories come together to create for a coherent film?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The first John Wick is where it should&#39;ve ended, it was a perfect action movie from start to finish, little bit of emotion, little bit of laughs alot of action, I enjoyed the sequels don&#39;t get me wrong but I just feel like they kind of took away how perfect the first was by not allowing it to end there. It was a great ending in my opinion, and if they wanted to make more they should&#39;ve done prequels instead of sequels to be able to keep the ending, how do yall feel.about this? And also what other action movies are perfect in their on way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mando0351"> /u/Mando0351 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8la1k/john_wick_hot_take/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8la1k/john_wick_hot_take/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anyone seen this absolute masterpiece of comedy, in which a fully-adult Martin Short plays a little boy with an obsession for the theme park Dinosaur World? </p> <p>This was a classic in my family, since I was a kid. My entire family quotes it all the time, and I have yet to ever meet a single person outside of my parents and sister who have ever even heard of it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CassTeaElle"> /u/CassTeaElle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8j1iu/clifford_not_the_big_red_dog/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8j1iu/clifford_not_the_big_red_dog/">[comments]</a></span>
