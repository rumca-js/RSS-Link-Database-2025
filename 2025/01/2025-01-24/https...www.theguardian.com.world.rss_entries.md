Not only did the artistic director present his latest menswear collection for Dior, but he collected the prestigious Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur, a rarity for someone from outside France.

<p>Bridges collapse and houses and cars buried in thick mud after intense rainfall triggers landslides in central Java</p><p>Heavy rain across Indonesia has caused major flooding. On Java, the country’s main island, flooding caused a landslidethat has killed more than 20 people, with several more missing. The landslide was triggered by particularly intense rainfall in the mountainous area close to Pekalongan in the central part of the island, leading to bridges collapsing and houses and cars being buried in the thick mud. Indonesia is vulnerable to flooding and landslides during its rainy season from November to April. However, the climate crisis appears to be increasing the intensity of the rainstorms, worsening the flooding, as well as allowing them to occur outside the usual season. Last May, 67 people died after torrential rain caused flash floods in West Sumatra.</p><p>In stark contrast, a winter drought has been affecting parts of Pakistan.
