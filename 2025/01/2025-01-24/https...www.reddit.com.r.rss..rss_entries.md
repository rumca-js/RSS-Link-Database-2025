<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am no doubt oversimplifying- but for the sake of owning and sharing the content I create, why don&#39;t we consider using RSS from a personal website/blog, where I can post any content I want, and then have some app where I share my feed and people can follow/subscribe if they want. Aggregate all the feeds I follow into a timeline, like old Instagram. Something like Digg I suppose but with commenting, more community friendly features, tags, etc... </p> <p>My RSS feed is portable anywhere, it would have to work in a way that my followers wouldn&#39;t be tied to Digg in this example but to the RSS feed itself. So maybe that is a challenge...</p> <p>But why is decentralized content/social media so complicated? - RSS seems like an obvious solution or the start of one to me. - just a simple question from a simple mind perhaps ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vast-6143"> /u/Vast-6143 </a> <br/> <sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use <a href="https://newsboat.org/index.html">Newsboat</a> and have not tried <a href="https://codeberg.org/newsraft/newsraft">Newsraft</a> which one of the two do you prefer and why? If I&#39;m not mistaken Newsraft have simplified certain things and is supposed to have &quot;less code&quot; as in trying to be Newsboat&#39;s counterpart in being more minimalistic.</p> <p>Newsboat was hard to set up as a beginner but once I got a hang of it, it got easier and their <a href="https://newsboat.org/releases/2.38/docs/newsboat.html">documentation</a> is outstanding I must say. </p> <p>The only reason I went with Newsboat and not a GUI based RSS reader was due to the fact that I like the idea of being able to read RSS feeds in the terminal, I just thought that was &quot;cool&quot; and now I&#39;m used to it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ghostprompt"> /u/Ghostprompt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:
