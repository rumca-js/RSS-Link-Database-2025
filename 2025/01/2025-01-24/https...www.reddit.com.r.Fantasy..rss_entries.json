Most series seem to - at most - take place over a few years, even though such enormous things happen that seem like they should take longer. <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong>, <strong>Wheel of Time</strong>, <strong>Stormlight Archive</strong> - they all have this issue even if there are technically timeskips that make for at least tenuously believable movement of actors.</p> <p>There are obviously stories that take place over decades or even centuries, but they normally involve abandoning one story to tell another. What I&#39;m looking for are <strong>single stories</strong> that take <em>plausible</em> amounts of time for big things to happen. Stops in towns that encompass weeks.

The tweet:</p> <blockquote> <p>Walter Bagehot wrote, in a line I dearly love, that &#39;we must not let in daylight upon magic.&#39; It applies to fantasy literature (and film/tv) of course, but for me it also applies more widely, to the making of art. And it is NOT in tune with trends of today.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, does anyone know of any books like that? I&#39;d especially be greatful for any that are engagingly written, as opposed to dryly academic. And I&#39;m more interested in modern fantasy, but I know magic literally goes back to the oldest written stories.

Tried reading LOTR years back.... no hate but I couldn&#39;t really get into it. I&#39;ll try again at some point though haha. GoT is also on my radar, but I&#39;m hesitant to pick it up since it doesn&#39;t seem like GRRM is completing it anytime soon ha </p> <p>Other enjoyable reads in recent memory include - Ken Liu&#39;s Dandelion Dynasty series, which has become one of my favourites! Speaking Bones is PEAK - Neil Gaiman&#39;s works, especially The Ocean at the End of the Lane and Neverwhere - The Spear Cuts Through Water - The Poppy War trilogy - ",

I really enjoyed game of thrones and decided to start getting interested into fantasy books. And as hard as I try, I REALLY struggle to put a world or setting together and sometimes even a character together when it is being described in detail. My first ever fantasy book was brandon sanderson Mistborn, because I hear his books are easy to read, which i ended up quitting cause I had built up this really stupid world and I had forgotten most characters that it just stopped making sense after I was halfway through. Then I decided to read stormlight archive which I struggled to even understand the first few chapters so I quit. Then i really headed back to some more childish books such as percy jackson and it was definitely a lot easier to read and understand despite sometimes building up a confusing artwork in my head.

This series was the exact thing I didn&#39;t know I needed. What I loved most was not the exploration, action or characters (which were all pretty good), but rather the details of how Raksura society functioned. My favorite parts were the ones you had two different groups of Raksura interacting as per established protocol. The interaction between the various castes among the Raksura was pretty neat as well.</p> <p>Could someone please recommend me books where there is a lot of focus on norms, etiquette, protocol and the interaction between social classes? I don&#39;t mean that they are very important (which they obviously would be), but that the book goes into a lot of detail about them. Another similar one I can think of is: The Goblin Emperor, which had a lot of made up words, customs, and norms with regard to the royal court.</p> <",

Now, it still confuses me a little, because I think it probably should&#39;ve been heavily edited, but I can at least understand what it is the way it is.
