So glad I checked. I noticed that Wave Browser had been installed. Now on my laptop it looked like the full application but when I clicked on it (yes I know, really stupid move) it prompted me to fully install it. I promptly deleted the downloaded file but after doing reasearch on this subreddit I was informed that I might need to go through more of a thorough process</p> <p>So I downloaded Malwarebytes as recommended as well as Avast Antivirus for some extra piece of mind. First I scanned with MB, the result was 4 threatening files with names like .Wav so I assumed they were part of the application files.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, as the title suggests, I’ve been hacked. I’ve downloaded an .exe from a website that is crypto affiliated and ran the file without properly checking it - I know, my bad. </p> <p>Around 12 hours after, my crypto wallet got hacked and it sent all the crypto I was holding to a SOL address. (No worries, I hold my crypto on a ledger, so it was basically nothing). </p> <p>But I’d like to know what’s the next step in protecting my pc going further. I’ve done checks with Malwarebytes and Windows Defender but nothing came out. </p> <p>I’ve reinstalled the windows but I still have plenty of files in the other hdds. </p> <p>Any suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AgentOdd5713"> /u/AgentOdd5713 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i95ev4/ive_been_hacked_and_i_want_to_understand_how/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comme

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to learn about executable packing using c++ ( to understand more about it and learn about c++ ).</p> <p>I have a basic cli app set up that reads a stub and then adds it and a simple hello world payload into a new exe. </p> <p>Then to unpack I grab the memory address of the new file, add the stub size and read payload size number of bytes after that. </p> <p>The issue is I never seem to be able to get the payload back. The memory I’m reading seems to have garbage in it. </p> <p>Am I missing something here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cwright017"> /u/cwright017 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i8y2jm/extracting_payload_from_exe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i8y2jm/extracting_payload_from_exe/">[comments]</a></span>
