I&#39;m trying to replace the free time I use playing videogames/going out to bars/doom scrolling /watching movies etc with intense learning and feel maybe learning about computers and the art of programming could be very fulfilling.</p> <p>I know I need to learn as much about computers as possible, perhaps look into some courses on LinkedIn regarding A+ certs, but also wondered if hacking Sims like Bitburner, Hacknet, or even buildapc games on steam could be considered a reliable way to get into the skill.</p> <p>Let me know your thoughts if you have played any sim and/or reccomendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Difficulty6982"> /u/No-Difficulty6982 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1i976xh/are_hacking_sims_a_good_way_to_get_into_actual/">[link]</a></sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanna get a cheap thinkpad that i can use with kali for pentesting, maybe dualbooting to windows if some apps dont work.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A couple weeks ago I download a video from Yt through a MP4 downloader. After the video was downloaded I went into the gallery and the thumbnail of that video was the logo of the fsociety from Mr robot ( I know it sounds a joke but it really isn&#39;t. ).</p> <p>I didn&#39;t open the video and I immediately removed it, at first I thought it was just a prank to scare people but some days later I noticed that sometimes when I opened applications like Play store, Yt, or Google photo it asked me to do the login (always using the fingerprint, I never used my password to login). </p> <p>I tried lots of antivirus and everytime I got the same result: no virus </p> <p>What can I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/luca_saa"> /u/luca_saa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1i8yt1f/have_i_been_hacked/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/
