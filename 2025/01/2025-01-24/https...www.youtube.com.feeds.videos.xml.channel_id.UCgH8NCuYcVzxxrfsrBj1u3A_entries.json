Some of the reactions to the video for \"I Hate Myself\" were, let's say, 'unusual', so it's something I've been thinking about  - along with how expectations have perhaps changed. \n\nThe new Darkness album comes out in March, you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\nStream / Download the latest single 'I Hate Myself': https://thedarkness.lnk.to/ihm\n\nThe Darkness are also going on tour across the UK in March, tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nTalk to me on Patreon:  http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview",
