<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to scrape <a href="http://yellowpages.com">yellowpages.com</a>, i am able to scrape the first page, but for any subsequent pages i am getting a popup saying &quot;claim your listing&quot; with a captcha. I am using the puppeteer-real-browser tool in non-headless mode to avoid detection and it was working fine with other websites, better than playwright-stealth atleast. Can anyone help me with this.<br/> PS: This is just with basic testing, i am not scraping hundreds of pages or anything, this issue happens on the second page itself. Also, i cannot use the api to get the data, this is part of a ai powered generalized scraper project.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tgvaizothofh"> /u/tgvaizothofh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i93gd5/newbie_need_help_with_scraping_yellowpages/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webs

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello All! There is the Event Website: <a href="https://www.gulfood.com/exhibitor-list">https://www.gulfood.com/exhibitor-list</a></p> <p>I want to scrape the Name, Hall and Location. Along with this, if i click on any name a pop up appears which shows the website link when i hover on the visit website. Which means i want Name, Hall, Location and Website. I would be grateful if someone can help me! Will python work? Significant part of the job is to go the event website, browse manually over the 5,500 participants (and requires clicking each time to go to the next, is not even in a list at a glance) and just capture the name of the company, then go to their website to find their email and phone, then putting this info in an Excel to later track who we have emailed and who have replied, and email all the companies. Until here the part we can automate (which I seek your advice for) Please guide! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre
