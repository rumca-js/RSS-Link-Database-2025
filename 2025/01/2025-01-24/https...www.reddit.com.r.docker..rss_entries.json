I end up regularly rebooting the NAS, because we have power issues in this part of Nashville (I&#39;m considering a generator, but don&#39;t have one yet). I have an nginx proxy manager container that doesn&#39;t come back up after the reboot (logs indicate an IP address conflict and an error 128 is thrown), but will come up after a few minutes. I currently have restart:unless-stopped set, but it is not working. I&#39;m not using a docker swarm.</p> <p>Is there a way to get this thing to try restarting, wait a minute, and then try again for a number of iterations like what restart_policy is supposed to do (but only for swarms, apparently)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/williamwgant\"> /u/williamwgant </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1i97w86/need_clarification_on",
