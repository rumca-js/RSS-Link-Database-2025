"Home sales in the final months of the year showed solid recovery despite elevated mortgage rates," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.

"Even with the improved market sentiment we've seen, investors are going to continue scrutinizing deals carefully," said IPOX CEO Josef Schuster.  The pushback against Venture Global's initial target came as sort of surprise, as it seemed to have a few factors going for it: demand for natural gas worldwide and a desire for more fossil-fuel production from new U.S. President Donald Trump.
