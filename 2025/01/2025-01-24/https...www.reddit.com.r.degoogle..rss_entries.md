This seems like the kind of place to give some factual answers without a political spin. </p> <p>Have Google Scholar results changed since the change in administration in the US? If this is true, is there a Google free alt for scientific/medical research?</p> <p>I ask because there is a particular medical subject that I Google Scholar regularly. It is a pregnancy issue that is related to COVID. I had a theory that I looked for support towards for over a year now. I was medical professional for over a decade and thought I knew a thing or two about medical research, proper terminology, how to use search engines, etc. </p> <p>Well, I try this search again 2 days ago and the results were completely different. All the top hits were confirming my theory, and referencing other research that was several years old to boot. There is zero chance I would have missed these papers if Go

I&#39;ve seen many people talk about proton but I know that their free plan only offers one account and I&#39;d have to pay if I wanted to have more. Do you guys have any suggestions?</p> <p>I also tried to look into Skiff but I saw that they merged (I think) with motion and is not available anymore as a mail service.</p> <p>I need multiple accounts for job purposes, I need to separate my stuff because having a single email makes me go nuts trying to search for stuff and trying to delete all the spam messages/all ads and promotional stuff, and if I try to unsubscribe from them they always somehow come back.</p> <p>Any help would be much appreciated!

But let me tell you, this is not going to be a fast processâ€”this will take a while. My biggest workhorses are YouTube and Google Maps, and I feel especially stuck when it comes to Maps.</p> <p>I live in Europe, and I move around constantlyâ€”bike, walking, public transportâ€”you name it. Nothing beats Google Maps when it comes to giving me precise routes for all these modes. The alternatives Iâ€™ve tried donâ€™t seem to measure up.</p> <p>But hereâ€™s the thing: I <em>love</em> seeing my routes. Iâ€™m kind of nostalgic like that. Iâ€™ve got pins in every place Iâ€™ve visited, and seeing my travel history feels weirdly satisfying. It&#39;s also hilarious sometimesâ€”like when I come home drunk and check Maps the next day to see the totally random routes I took that I donâ€™t even remember. XD</p> <p>I <em>hate</e
