## Life expectancy in the Gaza Strip almost halved since the war started - Study found the average life expectancy dropped from 75.5 years to 40.5 years (-46.3%), and the decrease was higher in men (-51.6%) than in women (-38.6%). May be underestimated as excludes missing people and indirect effects.
