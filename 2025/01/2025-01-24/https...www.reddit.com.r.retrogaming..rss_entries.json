Moreover, another main aspect: I cannot afford investing more than ~500$ at the moment and would like to keep the entire project \u201crelatively\u201d budget friendly for my family\u2019s sake \u2013 times are expensive enough :D I am aware that this will not lead to the most crisp / stunning visuals immediately, but I was hoping to take some good first steps on which to build on maybe in the future. </p> <p>Due to me living in continental Europe, I am also faced with the situation of having to pay pretty high shipping prices and tariffs for products from the US or the UK, where most of the high quality equipment seems to be manufactured. Therefore, I would like to avoid buying things too separa",

Instead of using one of my many retro handheld devices, I&#39;ve been playing Double Dragon II on my Switch via NSO. Side story - back when the games for the NES Classic was first announced, I remember telling a few of my friends how disappointed I was that Double Dragon II was selected instead of Double Dragon III. All of them preferred DD II, which surprised me a lot.</p> <p>Well, playing Double Dragon II now reminded me of why I preferred III. I really hate the punch/kick scheme in II. It&#39;s easy to see why developers did not adapt this idea of assigning B to left attacks and A to right attacks in future games - it&#39;s not a good idea. And I really hate the platforming challenges that the devs put in DD II. This is a beat &#39;em up game, not Mega Man.

For example, I\u2019m considering a school project where I\u2019d recreate a modernized version of the <em>Shrek 2</em> game map using today\u2019s technology, but I want to base it on the original map. The issue is that the maps are in .unr format, and the UnrealEd version I found online keeps crashing.</p> <p>I\u2019d really love to breathe some new life into this old gem, but I\u2019m unsure how to proceed.
