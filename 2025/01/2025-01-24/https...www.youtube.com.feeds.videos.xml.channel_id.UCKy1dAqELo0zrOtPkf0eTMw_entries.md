In today's Daily Fix:
Microsoft and Bethesda dropped some new details on the upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages yesterday, but one feature from the previous two games seems to be missing: multiplayer. The developers at id did confirm that the game only has a single-player campaign, only because they wanted to "go all-in on the campaign." Sorry, no ripping and tearing with friends, but you get to pilot a giant mech and ride a dragon, so that's a pretty good trade-off. In other news, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black just surprise-dropped onto consoles and PC yesterday, but if you're holding off because you want a physical copy, you're in luck. Odd thing is that it's only for PS5, which is weird because the game was announced at an Xbox event and is now available on Game Pass. And finally, in entertainment news, director Robert Eggers has a couple of projects lined up after finding success with his take on Nosferatu. Eggers will reportedly helm a sequel to Labyrinth, the 80s dark fantasy film starring th

Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week Daemon is joined by Ryan McCaffrey of Podcast Unlocked, and Jada Griffin from Nintendo Voice Chat. The topic: could, and will, Grand Theft Auto 6 be priced at $80 or more? Is a $100 base price for that game reasonable considering inflation rates and the rising cost of game development? Should hours a player will spend in the game determine how much they pay for it? And will the whole industry follow suit? Plus we have a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.

## Hyper Light Breaker Early Review

Hyper Light Breaker reviewed in early access by Travis Northup on PC.

At its early access launch, Hyper Light Breaker is a sloppy roguelite that makes poor use of the Hyper Light world I adore. Combat is messy and repetitive, bosses are cheesy and frustrating as all get out, the procedural worlds are awkward to explore, and both loot and progression are half-baked. Cover all of that in a thick layer of the usual work-in-progress technical problems, and you’ve got yourself a particularly rough package, even when accompanied by friends. Riding around on a hoverboard while taking in the colorful scenery can give way to some enjoyable moments, so I’ve still found reasons to be hopeful things could be polished to a more impressive shine over the course of Hyper Light Breaker’s early access development. But for now, you might want to wait and see if there’s a hyper light at the end of this tunnel.
