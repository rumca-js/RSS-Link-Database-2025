I hadn&#39;t known about it before choosing to watch the movie so I think it was an important story to tell.</p> <p>And to show the real guy at the end pretty obviously just coping with what he did by acting like anything he did was courageous is crazyyyy.

I just have a question that I hope one of you guys can clear up for me\u2026 what happened in the last scene at the restaurant when Stan\u2019s character sees the woman sitting alone across the restaurant? I must\u2019ve missed something but I didn\u2019t get that part. Stan\u2019s character seemed incredibly happy to see her\u2026 I know it\u2019s subtle, but how does that woman contribute to the story? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LeavesInsults1291\"> /u/LeavesInsults1291 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8or35/just_finished_watching_a_different_man_starring/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i8or35/just_finished_watching_a_different_man_starring/\">[comments]</a></span>",
