Chappell Roan has been speaking about life in the spotlight again and she's not the only one. Some of the reactions to the video for "I Hate Myself" were, let's say, 'unusual', so it's something I've been thinking about  - along with how expectations have perhaps changed. 

The new Darkness album comes out in March, you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/
Stream / Download the latest single 'I Hate Myself': https://thedarkness.lnk.to/ihm
