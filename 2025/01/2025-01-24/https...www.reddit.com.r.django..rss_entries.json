While developing with it, I noticed just how bad the documentation was, compared to say, Django Allauth headless. Do <code>dj-rest-auth</code> docs suck or am I not looking at the right place? </p> <p>For example, I wanted to see what the <code>/register</code> endpoint might return for, say, password validation errors, but the <a href=\"https://dj-rest-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_endpoints.html#registration\">docs</a> don&#39;t mention anything about what a response might look like, and I was left to guess what an invalid response might look like based on trial and error.
