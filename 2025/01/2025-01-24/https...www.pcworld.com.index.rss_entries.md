<p>Plex is the middle of a full-on makeover, starting two months ago with the <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2528572/plexs-overhauled-app-promotes-libraries-ditches-the-hamburgers.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techhive.com/article/2528572/plexs-overhauled-app-promotes-libraries-ditches-the-hamburgers.html">rollout of an all-new look and feel for its mobile app</a>, and now Apple TV users are getting a turn. </p>

## Ventiva’s fanless laptop cooler wins Intel and Dell over

<p>Around Christmas time, Ventiva launched its Ionic Cooling Engine (ICE), the latest in what has been an unexpectedly disappointing industry of fanless cooling solutions for laptops. But with Ventiva, there’s a key difference: It has a customer.</p>



<p>Ventiva, Intel, and Dell have collaborated on a proof-of-concept laptop that the company is showing off here at the CES show in Las Vegas. Inside is Ventiva’s ICE, which uses electrohydrodynamic airflow to strip about 25 watts’ worth of heat from a Core Ultra 200 (Lunar Lake) laptop — and essentially silently, to boot.</p>



<p>To be fair, Dell hasn’t formally committed to shipping the unnamed laptop, though it casually placed Ventiva’s name on its concept laptop, something that you don’t often see. Intel even endorsed the technology in its CES materials.</p>

<p>These days, if you want a powerful everyday computer, you might as well get a mini PC. They pack a lot of power at great prices, and they’re perfect if you don’t need the portability of a laptop.</p>

<p>Microsoft has just made Windows 10 users an offer they (almost) can’t refuse: a free update to Windows 11 version 24H2. Details can be found on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2">this support page</a>, where Microsoft writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Windows 11, version 24H2, also known as the Windows 11 2024 Update, is now broadly available.</p>



<p>Starting this week, we are expanding this latest Windows version’s phased rollout. We are gradually offering this update also to eligible devices running Windows 10, version 22H2.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Clearly, Microsoft wants Windows 10 users to transition to Windows 11, and they’re doing everything they can to make the process as easy and enticing as possible. The company also wants

<p>You’ve almost certainly used QR codes before—it’s when you point your phone’s camera at a square barcode to access a menu, a form, or even an app, and then tap on the link that appears. But while most QR codes are often innocuous (especially compared to their early wild days), their low-tech and humble vibe make them perfect tools for bad actors.</p>



<p>A recent example surfaced in the news just last week, with Malwarebytes publishing <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/01/whatsapp-spear-phishing-campaign-uses-qr-codes-to-add-device">a blog post</a> about a targeted QR code attack on WhatsApp accounts. Broken QR codes served as bait for victims, who were lured into clicking a link and following instructions that granted access to a new device. That hacker-owned device then gained the ability to read and potentially download full message

<p>These days, when it comes to laptop hardware, everyone’s talking about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2457268/what-the-heck-is-an-npu-anyway-everything-you-need-to-know.html">neural processing units (NPUs)</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2401239/the-ai-pc-revolution-18-essential-terms-you-need-to-know.html">artificial intelligence PCs</a>. What they <em>should</em> be talking about is laptop battery life!</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking for a lightweight productivity machine or a powerful gaming laptop, you shouldn’t have to settle for bad battery life. That’s never been more true than in 2025, as battery life and power consumption have dramatically improved over the last few years — to a degree, anyway. Not <em>all</em> laptops have good battery life.</p>

<p>Netflix is metaphorically flexing its muscles and spiking the football this week, announcing both record fourth-quarter subscriber gains and price hikes for nearly every one of its plans.</p>



<p>In other words, the streaming giant has you right where it wants you.

<p>I’ve been a Windows on Arm skeptic for years, but now I can say with certainty that I’ll consider a Snapdragon PC for every business trip I take.</p>



<p>I recently completed a six-day tour of duty in Las Vegas, where I and many of my colleagues journeyed as part of our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571925/best-of-ces-2025-16-products-that-have-us-pumped.html">annual CES pilgrimage</a>. I used the Surface Laptop 7, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, for the entire time. For me, that’s a big deal.</p>



<p>I distinctly remember traveling to an Intel Developer Forum conference, most likely in San Francisco, and witnessing an SSD fail completely on a fellow reporter’s laptop. Since then, I’ve generally taken not one but two laptops to industry events, in case one failed or ran out of juice. I know, it’s ridiculous. But I could rest

<p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2575551/lenovo-legion-go-s-hands-on-steamos-and-windows-flavors.html">Lenovo’s second-gen Legion Go S</a> handheld is powered by Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, the first PC gaming handheld to hold that honor, has started tongues wagging that Microsoft should be very worried about SteamOS establishing a foothold in prebuilt PCs.</p>



<p>PCWorld’s Michael Crider officially kickstarted that thread in his article <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2571541/microsoft-should-be-terrified-of-steamos.html">Microsoft should be terrified of SteamOS</a>, and if you haven’t had a chance to read it yet, you should!
