Contrary to the attitudes of many of my colleagues in the academy, academic freedom and independence are not rights or entitlements. They result from a political bargain and one that has become more fraught in recent decades. Essentially, the bargain goes like this: Academics will independently cultivate, curate, expand, and disseminate knowledge from the sciences [&#8230;]

One of my favorite things to do when I have an evening all to myself is to sit with a book at the bar at my favorite restaurant. It’s an old-fashioned, low-key kind of pleasure — the very best kind, in my experience — and when I was younger, it’s exactly what I imagined being [&#8230;]

To the extent the “average person” was aware of the work of David Lynch, the visionary surrealist director who died on Jan. 15 at the age of 78 after a bout with emphysema, they might have simply summed up his work as “weird.” Which would not be strictly incorrect, given the grotesque humanoid creatures, sudden [&#8230;]

The bar for actors aging gracefully in Hollywood is not particularly high. Many legends have tried and failed. Against his better judgment, Cary Grant consented to appear opposite the far-younger Audrey Hepburn in Charade, and against all standards of common decency, Burt Reynolds attempted to prolong his fading stardom by donning a toupee. By contrast, [&#8230;]

During former President Joe Biden’s chaotic, hopelessly inadequate evacuation effort in Kabul, I was bombarded day and night by messages from many Afghans who served with our military or with the elected Afghan government. Could I get them on one of those planes? Could I help to arrange asylum? Would I at least help evacuate [&#8230;]

President Donald Trump said the United States would have to &#8220;verify times 10&#8221; that Iran wouldn&#8217;t harbor a nuclear weapon if they made a deal with the country to denuclearize. Trump said in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity that Iran &#8220;can&#8217;t have a nuclear weapon&#8221; and that the U.S. would have to be [&#8230;]

In 2021, Netflix’s miniseries Squid Game immediately established itself as one of the most upsetting television series ever made —&#160;and one of the best. The South Korean show’s new second season is a needless and unsatisfying, if sometimes interesting, coda to one of the most important television series of the streaming era. Three years after [&#8230;]

Multiple communities on Reddit have banned links from Elon Musk&#8217;s X platform after the tech mogul flashed a gesture that resembled a Nazi salute during an inauguration event. Musk has vehemently denied that his gesture of placing his hand on his heart and quickly extending his arm was a Nazi salute, later mocking those who [&#8230;]

Gun violence prevention activists are outraged after President Donald Trump shuttered an office set up by former President Joe Biden to promote common sense gun reforms at the federal, state, and local levels. The website for the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which was active prior to Trump&#8217;s inauguration, now directs to a [&#8230;]

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) has introduced a resolution to modify the 22nd Amendment to allow President Donald Trump to serve a third term. The Tennessee House Republican announced on Thursday that he was introducing the joint resolution. If such a change were enacted, it would allow Trump to be the first president since Franklin Delano [&#8230;]
