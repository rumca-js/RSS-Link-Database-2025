When it was announced that Ghost Rider would get a big-screen adaptation, comic book fans were thrilled. With Nicholas Cage cast as Johnny Blaze, it seemed like a match made in heaven for one of the coolest comic book characters ever created. But the reality didnâ€™t live up to the hype.  The first Ghost Rider film was a box-office disappointment, and its sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, fared even worse. Now, with no new adaptations in sight, fans are left wondering: Will we ever see a Ghost Rider movie that does the character justice?
