  <p id="pIY6nk">Nearly a week after it was removed, the TikTok app is still missing from Apple and Google’s app stores.</p>
<p id="d1Tn9n">The app was pulled from both stores after the US’ ban-or-divest law went into effect last weekend, which resulted in the service going dark within the United States. While TikTok came <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">back online</a> shortly after the ban, the app didn’t return to either mobile store.

  <p id="MkaEmo">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expects to spend as much as $65 billion on AI in 2025 as part of a “massive effort” to further the company’s AI ambitions. Part of the plan includes a Louisiana data center that Zuckerberg says “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” he wrote <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/DFNf73PJxOQ?xmt=AQGziHgzfL_U7TmT2fWfVtTVk1MwO5Mttturl9JjBmGRxw">on Threads</a> today.</p>

They’ll probably also be among the <em>best </em>Android phones of 2025. And yet the Unpacked event this week felt like one of the most boring phone launches... ever. Are we entering a new phase of the smartphone industry, in which companies basically just launch the same thing over and over? Wait a second: have we been in that phase for a while now?</p>

  <p id="LE1zHg">Microsoft says it’s shutting down its UK “experience center” in London next month, nearly six years after it first opened as a 21,000-square-foot Microsoft store. “To better align with its focus on digital growth, Microsoft has decided to exit the lease at the Microsoft Experience Centre in London early,” says an unnamed Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-flagship-retail-storefront-in-the-uk-cuts-lease-short-in-the-heart-of-london"><em>Windows Central</em></a>.</p>
