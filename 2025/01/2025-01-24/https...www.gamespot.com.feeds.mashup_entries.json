This is the first update to the settler-oriented multiplayer board game in about a decade, with the fifth edition--the version that transformed the name of the game from The Settlers of Catan to just Catan--releasing in June 2015. As the game celebrates its 30th birthday, the designers are hoping to maintain the game's place as a major go-to onramp for people discovering the joy of playing tabletop games.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"How do you keep an old game relevant even after 30 years, right? Especially when gaming has developed,\" managing director and game designer Benjamin Teuber told me. \"The hobby continues to develop and grow, and there are so many great games. Every year, I have three new favorite games, and next year there [will be] three more and that's awesome, that's beautiful. But there is apparently still something to Catan because we still have very good sales numbers.",

        "description": "<p>Circana has shared new video game data that shows how challenging 2024 was for video game hardware. Total spending on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch devices in the US declined a gargantuan 25%, dropping to $4.9 billion (down from $6.45 billion in 2023).</p><p>For December 2024 specifically, spending on new video game hardware fell 29%, declining to $1.1 billion. PS5 hardware sales in December 2024 dropped by 18%, with Xbox Series X|S and Switch sales each declining a more precipitous 38%.</p><p>A major drop in spending on video game hardware is expected, of course, given PS5 and Xbox Series X|S being past their prime selling peaks and the Switch's maturity in the market, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggacbcepk2r\">Circana's Mat Piscatella said</a>. That said, Piscatella commented that the decline was <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgh33abqkc2x\">bigger than he expected.</a></p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/ar",
