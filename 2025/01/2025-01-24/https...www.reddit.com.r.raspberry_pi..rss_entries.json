However for some reason the POE+ hat does not get power with the riser attached when I only power it through POE, but does get power when I power it through POE and remove the riser.</p> <p>I just set up a poe network switch so I could run a network of 8 raspberry pi (4b)s with POE hats and pi camera. I also have 8 2x20 socket risers from adafruit so I could make space for the camera cable in this setup. I spent hours trying to figure out my switch and after I finally got it working I thought it was still not correctly configured because none of my pis already connected to it were turned on automatically with POE enabled. I tried troubleshooting the hardware side of things and they all work perfectly fine when I take the riser off and connect the POE hat directly. There&#39;s a big prob",
