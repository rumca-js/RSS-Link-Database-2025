Inside is Ventiva\u2019s ICE, which uses electrohydrodynamic airflow to strip about 25 watts\u2019 worth of heat from a Core Ultra 200 (Lunar Lake) laptop \u2014 and essentially silently, to boot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, Dell hasn\u2019t formally committed to shipping the unnamed laptop, though it casually placed Ventiva\u2019s name on its concept laptop, something that you don\u2019t often see.
