Basically the game starts up I get a white screen then a crash.</p> <p><strong>SpecialK64.dll</strong> has been renamed to <strong>d3d11.dll</strong> and after first attempted launch creates the relevant files.

I also installed the <strong>LoDMod</strong> which is required and renamed it&#39;s <strong>xinput1_4</strong> to <strong>xinput 1_3</strong>.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ideally they would provide server tools so 3rd party servers can exist and define whatever anticheat mechanisms they like as many other games do. Barring that, what argument can they possibly make for not allowing us to simply opt out of their anticheat system?</p> <p>It seems a pretty obvious solution to me, so if I can think of it I&#39;m sure it will have occurred to e.g. Rockstar as well.</p> <p>Edit: Clarification I&#39;m not asking for an entirely separate version of the game here. Keep everything exactly the same, but if anticheat is disabled or fails to verify, drop me into non-anticheat mode.</p> <p>The non-anticheat servers could be hidden from the server list or matchmaking on anticheat enabled instances by default unless enabled. Non-anticheat servers could be spooled up on demand (just like anticheat servers already are) and require no more server resources than anticheat servers do.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello.</p> <p>So, I really like Medieval 2 Total War, and I managed to get mods running under the native Linux version (no Proton), however, I have to launch it through Steam launch parameters and I do not like that very much. Someone recommended SteamTinkerLaunch to me (<a href="https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch">https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch</a>), saying that it could, in the case of Medieval 2 Total War, run games that require EOP (Engine Overhaul Project), and that it could launch mods without needing to change the launch parameters. </p> <p>Medieval 2 mods come with a .bat file which could be used to launch them in Windows. </p> <p>My question is: How do I actually add the mods to this tool? Using the built-in &#39;&#39;Add a non steam game&#39;&#39; functionality seems to do nothing...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Roof3508"> /u/Competitive_Roof3508

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What game controller do people like for gaming on Linux?</p> <p>I currently have a Gulikit KingKong 2 Pro that I like, but has some quirks. First off, it&#39;s a Nintendo Switch button layout, so button glyphs in games are wrong (A/B and X/Y swapped), and for some reason the rumble feature only works if the controller is plugged in, not via Bluetooth.</p> <p>I recently bought (and then returned) an 8bitdo Ultimate Wired Controller but could not get my system to recognize it at all.</p> <p>I&#39;d prefer something with an XBox style button layout and hall effect joysticks, which narrows the field down quite a bit. I don&#39;t really care about wired versus wireless, but I do want the rumble feature to work either way.</p> <p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jllauser"> /u/jllauser </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i8zbs0/controller

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>3 weeks ago I built a machine that I want to use for an HTPC in my living room. It&#39;s been an off-and-on project, and It&#39;s been a bit frustrating because trying to get an OS installed on it has not been smooth sailing.</p> <p>What I&#39;m hoping for is some recommendation on a distro that can reliably re-create a SteamOS-like environment on it. </p> <h1>I have to emphasize, before you recommend bazzite or ChimeraOS, I have spent the last 3 weeks trying to install both, multiple times over, and have spent most of my weekends so far trying to understand why they just won&#39;t.</h1> <p>I&#39;ve checked every single BIOS parameter I could find mentioned as being a problem, but bazzite will often fail with some kind of error while installing flatpaks, and all I&#39;ve ever gotten out of ChimeraOS&#39; installer is &quot;Installation failed.&quot;, with no additional information. The journalctl hasn&#39;t been of much help either.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It might not be the freshest news, but some might find it important.</p> <p>For the longest time, RDNA users (RDNA2 was especially bad) had to cope with unstable VRR and overall bad frametime pacing, because the cards never used anything but the default bootup power profile. This profile is really close to power saving in it&#39;s heuristics and can cause stutter in games that don&#39;t max out the GPU (the gpu will downclock aggressively).</p> <p>Example: <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/-/project/4522/uploads/5a496d3095e3592e3bdc0202d901244f/PXL_20220625_162342739.mp4">bad vrr</a></p> <p>Finally, a patch series with this <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux/-/commit/336568de918e08c825b3b1cbe2ec809f2fc26d94">commit</a> landed in 6.13 which finally makes the 3D_FULL_SCREEN the default on dGPUs. The profile is applied on driver init.</p> <p>This mostly fixes issues with VRR on RDNA, but that can depend on your environment. Gnome

But I noticed in Mangohud, that I am at 100% GPU usage with only 150w power being drawn. Whats the deal? Isnt the 7900XT supposed to draw 300ish? I am using two separate cables from an 850w Corsair PSU, one of them is a daisy chain cable with only one plugged in, the other is a non daisy chain. When using only the daisy chain plugged into both connectors it also only pulls 150w, same as with 2 separate cords. This is when running FF7 Remake, or Rebirth.
