These go beyond finding correlations to identify cause-and-effect relationships, which is where real decision-making power comes from. In healthcare, for example, causal models help us understand how treatments impact outcomes rather than just predicting what might happen. They make AI more interpretable and actionable, especially in complex systems where understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d is critical.</p> <p>Another fascinating area is Gaussian processes, These are probabilistic models that provide not only predictions but also uncertainty estimates for those predictions. GPs are especially useful in small data settings or when interpretability is key, making them perfect for scientific research, optimization tasks, and even robotics. They might not have the flashy appeal of LLMs, but their ability to model complex functions with confidence is a game-changer in many fields.</p>",

It seems we are no closer to understanding how this emerges.</p> <p>I had a few thoughts:</p> <p>Maybe we can understand some precursors of consciousness before trying to explain the whole thing. I think consciousness depends on <em>understanding</em>, which in turn depends on its mental states having <em>meaning</em>.</p> <p>I think we can see how meaning arises - consider hieroglyphics in a pyramid. We can interpret their meaning because there is an awful lot of writing in hieroglyphics. It is possible to guess the meanings of a few symbols, and test that against a lot of text. If all the occurrences of a symbol make sense, with the assigned meaning, we continue by guessing related symbols. If not, we guess a new meaning. Eventually meanings are assigned to all symbols, which consistently make sense. Some meanings may be &#39;fuzzy&#39; - it might be",

Lately, I\u2019ve been gaining confidence and feel that I can learn math from the basics and eventually master the required concepts for AI, such as computational math. The problem is, I don\u2019t know where to start or what to learn first.</p> <p>I\u2019m genuinely interested in learning and want to achieve this within the next 6 months. Can you suggest what topics I should focus on and recommend the best resources to help me?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Growth_69\"> /u/No_Growth_69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i8v3ep",
