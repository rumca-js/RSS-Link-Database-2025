<p>At points, this year’s show has been repetitive, ropey, even blood vessel burstingly annoying – but it pulled it out of the bag with those blazing final showdowns</p><p>If you’ve been following The Traitors, you will already be aware that it hasn’t exactly been a vintage series. What felt fresh and exciting last year has now become slightly rote; something not helped by an intake of contestants who seemed to have been chosen based on their innate annoyingness.</p><p>One problem is that they all kept saying ‘yourself’ instead of ‘you’, which is a harrowing thing to have to hear over and over again for a month. But the bigger problem is that everyone is wise to the game now. Almost every contestant rocked up to Andross Castle with a honking great sense of self-interested superiority. And maybe that would have been fine, if it hadn’t made them all atomically insufferable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/24/the-traitors-finale-review-deliciously-evil-end

<p><em>This week, the bishop of Washington delivered a sermon in front of President Trump urging him to show mercy towards LGBTQ+ and migrant communities. The president condemned it as ‘nasty’.

Amen.</em></p><p><em>Jesus said, “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.

Dahlias come&nbsp;to mind, as do chrysanthemums: big, brash, often in questionable colours. Another is the camellia, which can be dismissed as being a bit Barbara Cartland due to its unabashed pinkness, but is gloriously welcome in these dark days of January – and beyond.</p><p>When I think of camellias I think of&nbsp;them at their fairytale best: the enormous tree-like shrub versions that begin blooming at this time of year, alongside the azaleas in Cannizaro Park in Wimbledon.

<p><strong>Royal Academy, London</strong><br>Brazil produces incredible artists, too few of whom appear in this deluded show, which sadly fails to live up to its own hyperbolic guff</p><p>What words would you use to describe the design of this exhibition of Brazilian modernist art? “Chic bombast” perhaps. The biggest room in the main galleries of Burlington House is painted bold yellow with the names of its two featured artists in huge black graphics and, for visitors to sit on, funky curving furniture. But there’s a mismatch between this ostentatious layout and the small canvases lined up on the walls, in greys, greens and browns. This is the kind of exhibition where everything is “trailblazing” and every artist a “pioneer”. But the art completely fails to match that hyperbolic guff.</p><p>“Anita Malfatti was a trailblazing artist whose modernist paintings shocked the Brazilian establishment,” claims a huge wall text that’s much bigger than her works.

<p>Three really is the magic number if you want to enhance your silhouette</p><p>Do you know about the rule of thirds? I didn’t. How did I not know about it? Anyway, I&nbsp;do&nbsp;now and I am obsessed. And you will&nbsp;be, too. So listen up.</p><p>The rule of thirds is a simple trick that makes you look better, by tweaking your proportions. It is failsafe, it is free, it works on everybody. If you are average height, it&nbsp;makes you look taller. I always wanted to be taller. In fact, in my heart, I&nbsp;believe that I am 5ft 10, like Cindy Crawford, although on the outside I am only 5ft 5½. I’ve never got&nbsp;to the bottom of this mystifying mix-up, but the rule of thirds is a more effective solution than high heels. And&nbsp;it doesn’t just make you look taller, it makes you look better. If you&nbsp;are already tall it makes you look&nbsp;leggier, and whatever height you&nbsp;are it enhances your silhouette, giving you a more supple, fluid line.</p> <a href="https://www.thegua

<p>Will Jayden Daniels make history? And can Josh Allen break his playoff drought against the champions? Here are our picks for this weekend</p><p><strong>Story of the season:</strong> Jayden Daniels is one game away from the extraordinary. A stunning seven-win rampage through the winter leaves Washington with just Philadelphia to beat for the NFC championship and Daniels to become the first rookie quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl. They need a second win in six weeks over an Eagles team with the strongest roster top to bottom in the NFL. But Philly’s stacked lineup, with Saquon Barkley at its nucleus, rang rings around the Commanders for an easy victory the teams’ other regular-season meeting, in November. The Eagles will be desperate to spoil the rookie’s party while clinching this unlikely season-defining series.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/24/nfl-championship-games-predictions-eagles-chiefs-commanders-bills">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arguments about evil risk distracting us from practical questions that could save lives in the future</p><p>Why? Why us, why here, why that day of all days; but most of all why our girls, our tiny excited girls, happily making bracelets for each other in a summer holiday workshop?</p><p>Such questions that must have been tormenting Southport families ever since last July, when a then 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana brutally murdered three of their children and tried to kill eight more (as well as two adults) in what prosecutors this week called a “sadistic” attack. The parents got no answers from the dock, where the boy – now man – who took their daughters sat silent, but for some oddly petulant outbursts against the judge. But in a sense the question is unanswerable. No motive, no twisted ideology or mental illness, could ever explain stabbing a six-year-old. Debating whether or not this was terrorism “misses the point”, the judge said as he sentenced Rudakubana to 52 years in prison

<p>With a new album next month, the singer-songwriter opens up about accepting life, anticipating grief and grieving when a snake killed his beloved dog</p><p>Mike Hadreas feels that he had self-destructive tendencies as young as seven. “I saw a white van with no windows go by,” he says. “And I remember waiting around, hoping that I was going to get kidnapped. I wanted the story. I wanted the intensity of it.”</p><p>As he got older, that urge never quite went away. “I would put myself in situations that were dark or demoralising, kind of for research, or to be able to say that I did that crazy thing,” he says. In a Row, a highlight from Glory, Hadreas’s new album as Perfume Genius, makes fun of that impulse, slyly skewering the idea that you have to suffer for your art: “Think of all the poems I’ll get out,” his narrator sings, trapped in the boot of a car.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/24/perfume-genius-i-want-to-feel-extremes-but-im-not-as-self-destructive
