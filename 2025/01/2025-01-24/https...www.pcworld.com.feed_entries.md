<p>Fans of physical media—myself included—tend to be a morbid bunch, dwelling on the rise of streaming while bemoaning the steady decline of Blu-ray, the home-media format of choice for cinephiles. </p>



<p>So when word came down that <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/after-18-years-blu-ray-media-production-draws-to-a-close-sony-shuts-its-last-factory-in-feb" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/after-18-years-blu-ray-media-production-draws-to-a-close-sony-shuts-its-last-factory-in-feb">Sony will exit the recordable Blu-ray market next month</a>, it naturally triggered a firestorm in the physical media community, not to mention dozens of scary headlines about—once again—the imminent death of Blu-ray discs. </p>



<p>The last time funeral bells tolled this loudly for Blu-ray, it was because <

<p>Microsoft is finally testing a way for you to quickly see how much battery your laptop has left — and with color-coded visual indicators, to boot.</p>



<p>It’s an extremely welcome addition, which had been left up to laptop makers to step in and provide (or not) in recent years. Unfortunately, for now it’s part of <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/01/24/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-3000-dev-channel/">Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26120.3000</a> (KB5050103), via the Dev Channel — which means that Microsoft may rescind it, and it probably won’t arrive on “stable” mainstream PCs for several months.</p>



<p>The new iconography is pretty self-explanatory: Green signals a laptop with plenty of battery life left. A red icon means that you better plug in soon. Yellow means that you’re running low on power, and that

## How to turn off Copilot in Microsoft 365 and save a quick $30

<p>Love Microsoft Copilot? Hate Microsoft Copilot? It doesn’t really matter: Chances are that if you’ve signed up for Microsoft 365, you’re now paying more for Microsoft’s integration of Copilot features, which was done without your consent. But there’s a way out, for now.</p>



<p>Microsoft is making available “classic” versions of its Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family plans, that remove the Copilot surcharge. But, as Microsoft said when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2581179/microsoft-follows-google-with-price-bump-forced-ai-365-bundles.html">it announced the changes</a>, these new Classic plans are available <em>for a limited time</em>. This article will show you how to switch back.</p>



<p>Right now, here’s what you’ll see when you sign up for Microsoft 365, with the option to pay $12.99/mo and $9.99/mo, too. Those reflect the h

<p>Framework’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423486/framework-laptop-13-review-2.html">completely modular laptops</a>, easily serviced and upgradeable by even novices with just a screwdriver, are having a big impact on the industry. Laptop designs from companies like Dell and Asus are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2566585/asuss-gaming-laptops-get-rtx-5090-gpus.html">showing clear inspiration</a> by being much easier to upgrade than they used to be. Intel seems to be paying attention, too, going by some new modular guidelines for both laptops and PCs.</p>



<p>Okay, “guidelines” might be a strong term for these concepts, which Intel laid out in <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Modular-PC-Design-A-Sustainable-Approach-for-Enhanced/post/1657681">its latest community blog post</a>. But these ideas for mo

<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/microsoft-is-working-on-a-smaller-surface-pro-and-surface-laptop-with-snapdragon-x">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is about to release new smaller versions of the Surface Pro 2-in-1 and Surface Laptop “in the coming weeks.” These new versions will remain premium products, with 11-inch or 12-inch screens and more lightweight designs.</p>



<p>Bowden cites unnamed sources who say that the smaller Surface Pro is meant to compete with Apple’s iPad Pro (which is 11 inches), not just on screen size and portability but also on refresh rate and pen support. Meanwhile, the Surface Laptop will reportedly have a higher resolution touchscreen, a backlit keyboard, and an all-metal body.</p>



<p>Both Surface Pro and Surface Laptop will continue to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors, but
