<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I enjoyed reading Evasion by CrimethInc, but it romanticizes a lifestyle of stealing and shopplifting and the author has a condescending tone for capitalism. Still, the narrator&#39;s scavenging off the system he professes to hate and has nothing to give in return. I really liked the story though and the point it was attempting to make. I want to read a book that has that kind of thrilling, urban nomadic train-hopping graffiti artist style in the form of a novel or text with a hyper-engaging story - I haven&#39;t read too many books before, but I&#39;ve never talked to a homeless person who didn&#39;t have a story to tell.

Here are a few books I&#39;ve read recently and really enjoyed:</p> <p>- Demon Copperhead, mostly liked this because of the characters and how real they felt, the angst and loneliness of the main character, as well as tying in how the small towns were really being influenced by large scale corruption</p> <p>- The Stand, again mostly liked this because of all of the different characters and their unique ways of reacting to things, and how the apocalyptic scenario really brings out people&#39;s true natures</p> <p>- The Godfather, really good variety of characters and suspense, also liked the vibe of being out of the matrix of society in a sense</p> <p>- Red Notice

I set myself a challenge to read a few more classics and enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird and Catcher in the Rye. I&#39;m finding 20000 leagues under the sea a bit slow and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn took me a while to get through. But now just looking for overall recommendations of good reads. </p> <p>I&#39;m a big lover of crime/ murder mysteries. Have read all of Agatha Christie&#39;s books, a few James Patterson novels too. I am also interested in some non-fiction like Prisoners of Geography and Kitchen Confidential (any more food related books I would love as recommendations). Also thoroughly enjoyed World War Z. </p> <p>Open to both fiction and non-fiction reads. Hopefully that&#39;s enough of a range to help give me some good recommendations!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My friends (M17) birthday is coming up, and he&#39;s really into murder mystery type books. Nothing dark, just an intriguing storyline. Usually with a really smart, perceptive main character, like him. One of his favorite authors is Agatha Christie, and recently he recommended &quot;Everyone in my family has killed someone&quot; By Benjamin Stevenson, and I really liked it! But I don&#39;t read those kinds of books often, so I have NO clue what&#39;s good, or similar, or what to possibly get him for his birthday.

## Guys please please suggest a book where gigantic, labyrinthine architectural structures become anthropomorphic and come to life, bonus points if they rebel with all the people that are existing inside them but that isn't necessary.
