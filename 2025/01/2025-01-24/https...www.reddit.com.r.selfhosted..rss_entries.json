I was trying to find an answer for my question on internet, but because I am quite an amateur and hobbyist about self host, maybe I was searching wrongly. I have a home made NAS server which is directly connected via cable to ISP router. This router streams movies via WiFi to Android boxes to my apartment. Sometimes I watch online TV and my son and wife streams something from NAS and it causes problems. We have maximum possible internet in our area 100mbit so no increase possible at the moment. My question is if there is any simple way to stream from NAS somehow independent on internet like in local network and use internet from real internet purposes. I hope it makes sense. Btw my NAS uses Windows 7.

My current plan is to setup a WireGuard server in a vps and then forward the traffic into my servers (via more WireGuard). I want to do it this way as it&#39;s easier to manage all the client connections this way and it helps simplify some site to site connections I have. The questions I have about this are 1) what are the security implications about using an external root ca? I&#39;m not the most knowledgeable about that hence why I went the full self hosted route as no one would know my internal ips and services. I am probably overthinking it but I know better than to not ask questions. 2) What do others do for there root ca needs? I have been looking at cloudflare And using there dns/domain servic",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been using SABnzbd in a windows VM in proxmox for a little bit now because I wanted it behind a vpn at first (and rerouting things through a vpn with linux containers sounded like a headache I wasn&#39;t ready for yet). Now that I realized SSL is more than enough, I want to put it in a container like the rest of my services. I tried using the Proxmox VE Helper-Script for it: <a href=\"https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=sabnzbd\">https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=sabnzbd</a> </p> <p>The container is running, it&#39;s console tells me SABnzbd is active. I tried doing a reinstall in case it was some bug. But I just can&#39;t seem to get the UI to show up. I gave the container a static ip address, and I&#39;ve tried extensions 8080 and 7777 to no avail. I&#39;m not finding much on this and am not sure what the next step would be.</p> <p>Any help is appreciated :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
