<p>Got a houseplant query? Our expert is here to answer them. This week, the tricky business of getting the <em>Ficus lyrata </em>through the winter</p><p><strong>What’s the problem?</strong><br>
 How can I prevent leaf drop in winter? My fiddle leaf fig is looking bare …</p><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br>
 The fiddle leaf fig (<em>Ficus lyrata</em>) can be&nbsp;a fickle plant, and winter presents a&nbsp;particularly challenging time because they’re sensitive to light, temperature and humidity changes. Leaf drop is a&nbsp;common issue during this season, often caused by drafts, low humidity or insufficient light. Keeping the heating on all day may not be the solution, as dry, heated air can exacerbate the problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/24/houseplant-clinic-help-my-fiddle-leaf-fig-through-winter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The relentless skill challenges of caring for his newborn baby reminded developer  Nicholas O’Brien of his day job. He explains how turning it all into a game helped him cope</p><p>I don’t remember much from the first weeks of parenthood – a colicky baby and extreme sleep deprivation will do that to you – but I do vividly remember one night with my baby son when absolutely nothing I did seemed to help him. I walked him around: he screamed. I tried to feed him: he screamed. I put him down: more screaming. So it went for a couple of hours. I remember thinking: this is like a text adventure video game where none of the answers are right.</p><p>Game designer and college teacher Nicholas O’Brien had similar thoughts. His first child was born during the Covid-19 pandemic in New York City, and he and his partner were trapped at home, on the endless merry-go-round of menial baby-care tasks.
