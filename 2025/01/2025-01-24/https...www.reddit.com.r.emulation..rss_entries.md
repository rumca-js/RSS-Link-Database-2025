<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Kega Fusion is the emulator that I&#39;ve been using for the Genesis for a long time (along with the other systems it emulates, GameGear, Master Systems, Sega CD and 32X), but it seems to be causing some issues for me recently.</p> <p>I know you have to fiddle with its compatibility settings to make it run good on some modern computers, but recently my computer doesn&#39;t simply want to open it. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any other good alternatives for all the stuff that it emulates so I&#39;m wondering if trying to make it work nowadays is still a good idea.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/houndoom92"> /u/houndoom92 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1i8v7yl/is_kega_fusion_still_workable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1i8v7yl/is_kega_fusion_still_workable/">[comments]</a></span>
