Today i&#39;ve stumbled upon a CTF that uses a simple anti-dbg measure, using just ptrace and PTRACE_TRACEME flag. By gathering some infos I saw that there is a simple hook I can use, suing the LD_PRELOAD flag. I did some tests on some programs that i wrote and seems effective. The problem about the CTF is that uses a dlopen of a specific lib in the system, it seems to be more relevant than the custom lib that I load with that flag obviously. Maybe I can solve the problem with patching but first I want to try solving the thing this way. Clearly there is something that I am missing here. I post here also the code if it might help.</p> <p><code>ptrace_sym = 0x61727470;</code></p> <p><code>local_1b = 0x6563;</code></p> <p><code>local_19 = 0;</code></p> <p><code>libhandle = dlopen(&quot;libc.so.6&quot;,1);</code></p> <p><code>if (libhandle == 0) {</code></p> <p><code>/* WARNING:",
