But let me tell you, this is not going to be a fast process\u2014this will take a while. My biggest workhorses are YouTube and Google Maps, and I feel especially stuck when it comes to Maps.</p> <p>I live in Europe, and I move around constantly\u2014bike, walking, public transport\u2014you name it. Nothing beats Google Maps when it comes to giving me precise routes for all these modes. The alternatives I\u2019ve tried don\u2019t seem to measure up.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing: I <em>love</em> seeing my routes. I\u2019m kind of nostalgic like that. I\u2019ve got pins in every place I\u2019ve visited, and seeing my travel history feels weirdly satisfying. It&#39;s also hilarious sometimes\u2014like when I come home drunk and check Maps the next day to see the totally random routes I took that I don\u2019t even remember. XD</p> <p>I <em>hate</e",
