But there are plenty of others in the US law enforcement industrial complex vying [&#8230;]

After King Trump&#8217;s dutiful Supreme Court recently refused to hear the case, a New York State law has taken effect requiring that ISPs provide low-income, state residents affordable $15 broadband.

Back in November, I explained in great detail how Trump’s new FCC chair Brendan Carr was signaling loud and clear that he intended to be Trump’s top censor. This was in contrast to both his and Trump’s declaration that Carr was some sort of “free speech warrior.” Instead, he has given every indication that he’s [&#8230;]

Well, well, well: let&#8217;s get this circuit split started! In completely unexpected news, the DC Court of Appeals has ruled [PDF] that compelling someone to unlock a device using their finger is a violation of Fifth Amendment protections that disallow forcing someone to testify against themselves.

We&#8217;ve talked repeatedly how one way to boost lagging U.S. broadband competition is the support of &#8220;open access&#8221; fiber networks that allow numerous ISPs to compete over a centralized fiber network. In ideal implementations, like Ammon, Idaho or in parts of Utah, residents have the option of switching between multiple, competing ISPs, sometimes in a [&#8230;]

To borrow a phrase famously used by the world class philosophers called Green Day, Elon Musk is something of a walking contradiction. He touts the so-called &#8220;Twitter Files&#8221; as some kind of damning report on government weaponization against critical content and is then accused of doing exactly the same thing himself.
