<p>Glass is a paradox: an ancient material at the forefront of modern technology, a state of matter occupying a liminal space between liquids and solids. As an artistic medium, the beauty of glass has captured the imagination of humankind for thousands of years. As an engineering material, glass in the form of fiber optics and smartphone screens has played a transformational role in bringing humanity to the Information Age [1]. What does the future hold for glass technology? We often look to science fiction for clues about how today’s science can be extrapolated to future advances. To this end, Project Starship is Grimdark Magazine’s science-meets-science fiction initiative to deepen the connection between the scientific and literary communities. The goal is to stimulate dialogue across these two often disparate fields, with a focus on engineering challenges posed by the starships from some of our favorite dark science fiction universes. Starships are a ubiquitous presence in science
