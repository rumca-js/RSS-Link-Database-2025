So glad I checked. I noticed that Wave Browser had been installed. Now on my laptop it looked like the full application but when I clicked on it (yes I know, really stupid move) it prompted me to fully install it. I promptly deleted the downloaded file but after doing reasearch on this subreddit I was informed that I might need to go through more of a thorough process</p> <p>So I downloaded Malwarebytes as recommended as well as Avast Antivirus for some extra piece of mind. First I scanned with MB, the result was 4 threatening files with names like .Wav so I assumed they were part of the application files. The files were automatically quarantined by MB and I pressed delete at some stage although the UI isn&#39;t ",
