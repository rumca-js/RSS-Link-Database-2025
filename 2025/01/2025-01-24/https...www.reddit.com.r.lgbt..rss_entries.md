<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i identify as a Trans man, and atleast from how i feel it&#39;s pretty much 100% spot on. But while i do still wanna dress masculinly, there are still many outfits and clothes or other things that i love but people might percieve as feminine. Like skirts, tights, some shirts etc. And honestly it has also led me to wonder if i even wanna start HRT in the future. To which that is completely my choice, but then also some feminine things like dresses or make-up make me uncomfortable. It&#39;s kinda strange.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GroupDependent6335"> /u/GroupDependent6335 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1i8uc7z/is_it_alright_that_i_identify_as_a_trans_man_but/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1i8uc7z/is_it_alright_that_i_identify_as_a_trans_man_but/">[comments]</a></span>
