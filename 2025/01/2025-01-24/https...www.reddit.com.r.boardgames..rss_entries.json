Some actually make the game even better in my opinion, but unfortunately, most bots <em>are</em> fiddly and uninspired, and you never know which are which til you play. Not without help, anyway. I was wondering, do you have any examples?</p> <p><strong>The Grizzled: At Your Orders!</strong> sticks out to me as being thematically improved by its expansion-specific 2 player mode - you get a bot who is characterized as being the youngest of you, and the least capable in this war. He always has at least 1 permanent Knock card, &quot;The Novice&quot;, so he&#39;s more likely to lose the game for himself and everyone else, but you also get to take turns controlling him, telling him what to do and hopefully gettin",

Sure, there are ways to counter their attacks, but they are not guaranteed to work, unless there is only single card left in their action deck and you 100% know what they will do. Sure, death is not end of everything, however it consumes your time, and time is crucially important resource because of harsh game timer.</p> <p>Not to mention that you will face tougher special monsters buffed by events.

It seems like a game I should have known of before but I only found it through the recommendation of a local seller. Everyone who I have bought from has been awesome, with chill pickups that usually take place alongside conversations about recent game nights.</p> <p>You may not be able to find the exact games you are looking for, but the lower cost enables more experimentation within the hobby. While places like board game cafes and stores are great places to try before you buy, some places (like where I live) don&#39;t have many of them and would otherwise have to order online.</p> <p>P",

I have an opportunity to do something that is not good for me at all - maybe I give away all my resources to another player, purposely destroy units, etc. - but it will increase my placing at the end to say, 3rd. I&#39;m doing something &#39;bad&#39; for me and that benefits another player. It won&#39;t help me win and might actually give another player the victory, but it raises my placing.
