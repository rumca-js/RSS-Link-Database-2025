        "description": "Hyper Light Breaker reviewed in early access by Travis Northup on PC.\n\nAt its early access launch, Hyper Light Breaker is a sloppy roguelite that makes poor use of the Hyper Light world I adore. Combat is messy and repetitive, bosses are cheesy and frustrating as all get out, the procedural worlds are awkward to explore, and both loot and progression are half-baked. Cover all of that in a thick layer of the usual work-in-progress technical problems, and you\u2019ve got yourself a particularly rough package, even when accompanied by friends. Riding around on a hoverboard while taking in the colorful scenery can give way to some enjoyable moments, so I\u2019ve still found reasons to be hopeful things could be polished to a more impressive shine over the course of Hyper Light Breaker\u2019s early access development. But for now, you might want to wait and see if there\u2019s a hyper light at the end of this tunnel.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
