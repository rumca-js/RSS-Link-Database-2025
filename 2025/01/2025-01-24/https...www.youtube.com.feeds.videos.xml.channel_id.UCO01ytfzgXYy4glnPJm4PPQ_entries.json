        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Trump continues his historic first week with another major achievement: pardoning Biden\u2019s pro-life political prisoners. Meanwhile, Democrats in the Senate unanimously blocked a law that would require doctors to provide medical treatment to newborn infants. The pro-life cause is winning, but we have a long way to go. Also, Trump declassifies all of the files on JFK, MLK, and every other famous assassinated person in the 20th century who used three initials. The rumor mill swirls around Barack and Michelle Obama\u2014are they headed for divorce? And, a musical about a transgender drug kingpin earned 13 Oscar nominations, in spite of the fact that the movie is, without question, one of the worst things ever put to film.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:40 Opening\n02:35 - 20:21 Biden\u2019s Pro-Life Political Prisoners Are Finally Free\n20:22 - 26:02 Trump Declassifies JFK, MLK, and RFK Files\n26:03 - 32:38 Rumors Trend On Social Media About A Possible Obama Divorce\n32:39 - 38:",
