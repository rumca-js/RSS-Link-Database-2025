Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time I take a look at a mod that passionate creators have put together where the map from GTA4 has been meticulously inserted into GTA5 and the results are far more impressive than I initially thought, with great potential for modding in the future I just hope with some of the assets shared this group doesn't attract the attention of Rockstar's lawyers. Thanks for watching!
