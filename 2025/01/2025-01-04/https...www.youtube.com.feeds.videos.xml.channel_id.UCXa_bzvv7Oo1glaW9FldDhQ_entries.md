Pioner is an upcoming online competitive shooter vying for your attention via its mix of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. style phantasmagoria, survival and crafting mechanics not dissimilar to Fallout, plus a healthy dose of game modes including PvE missions, PvP arenas, and an Escape from Tarkov inspired extraction mode. There’s plenty going on here. 

Instead of focusing on a niche, the developer is going all in on cramming as much as they can into their hostile MMORPG FPS, and to reduce the risk of overburdening players they’ve decided to divide the game’s gargantuan 50 square kilometre island open world into gameplay-specific zones. On top of all that there’s a story campaign, plus factions with whom you’ll choose to align or oppose. This could be great should it all meld together.
