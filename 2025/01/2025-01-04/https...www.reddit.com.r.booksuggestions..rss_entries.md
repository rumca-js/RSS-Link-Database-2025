<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently discovered EBT and received my card for it. It&#39;s been a game changer in college. I don&#39;t know how I had never heard of it before and I began wondering how many other life-hacking systems already exist that I just haven&#39;t been put onto. Maybe We&#39;re too hard on the government. is there some kind of book that gives me little tips and tricks just about living life in general? I&#39;m not just talking about a philosophical book, but a practical one. One that gives advice on managing and building wealth, forming interpersonal relationships, setting yourself up for the future, and the like. A book that functions as a sort of life advisor.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/supreme_beta"> /u/supreme_beta </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1htqxx9/any_suggestions_for_a_book_on_practical_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/

## I would love historical fiction set in the early colonial days of Australia

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m from the US and never learned a ton about Australian history beyond it being a penal colony and having a vague idea of the treatment of Aboriginal peoples, but I watched The Nightingale (2018) a couple years ago and think about it all the time. It’s set in the early 1800s and follows an Irish woman who reluctantly pairs up with a bitter Aboriginal Tasmanian guide to track an English soldier who committed crimes against her and get revenge on him. It explores some of the very brutal realities of colonialism (I recommend looking up trigger warnings before you watch it if there are particular things you’re sensitive to) and racism and was just an incredible movie, and I’d love to read something in the same vein set during that period. I’d prefer something with heavy focus on Aboriginal people, but I’m not sure how many books there really are in this period and would be satisfied with anything well-written. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hey y&#39;all! been recently obsessed with the tv show <em>The Bear</em> and cooking in general. i saw a youtube video from Skip the Intro (not a plug i promise lol) and it made me realize how there&#39;s definitely an undercurrent of class critique in the show, which is pretty cool. before i started watching <em>The Bear</em> i read the book <em>Our Lady of Perpetual Hunger</em> which is a memoir by a chef and while it wasn&#39;t exactly fine dining it touched upon the author&#39;s experience cooking both at home and in a professional kitchen, and that juxtaposition was really interesting to me. i&#39;ve found a few academic books about food production and marxism (<em>Let Them Eat Junk</em> by Albritton, haven&#39;t read it yet) which is up my alley but i was wondering if there&#39;s any more in that kind of vein. it doesn&#39;t have to be explicitly an academic book (but those are welcome!) or explicitly deals with class struggle. thanks very much

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for novel recommendations </p> <p>This past year, I’ve managed to read a lot of novels pertaining to Greek myths. Among them I’ve read</p> <ol> <li>Atalanta by Jennifer Saint</li> <li>Electra by Jennifer Saint</li> <li>Medusa’s Sisters by Lauren Bear</li> <li>Palace of Eros by Caro De Robertis</li> <li>Daughters of Olympus by Hannah Lynn</li> </ol> <p>I’ve also read Circe by Madeline Miller. The common thread in all of these is that they’re all written by women with the protagonist being either a goddess or female figure. A lot of these also have a sapphic plot point. I have no issues with this but for variety, I’m looking for a novel where the protagonist is a god or hero and for some reason, those are harder to find. I’ve tried Googling and most of the things that pop up are nonfiction texts. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Chain3171

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on book 4 of wheel of time, and honestly feel kinda meh about the series so far. I started wheel of time cause I&#39;ve read so much other fantasy, but I&#39;m thinking I just need a break lol.</p> <p>Some of my favorite non fantasy are IT, perfume, Jurassic Park, Congo. I mean I guess those are fantasy, but you know what I mean.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cheezer5000"> /u/cheezer5000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ht1r8k/i_think_i_need_a_break_from_fantasy_any_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ht1r8k/i_think_i_need_a_break_from_fantasy_any_good/">[comments]</a></span>
