<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the core components of modern antiviruses such as Kaspersky, BitDefender, OmniDefender, Avast and many more is the <strong>kernel-level real-time protection</strong>. </p> <p>Unlike traditional monitoring methods that rely on high-level process observation, <strong>kernel-level monitoring</strong> allows us to capture low-level interactions between processes and the operating system. This provides detailed insights into how malware behaves in real-time—insights that are invaluable for threat intelligence and improving <strong>detection capabilities</strong>.</p> <p>Take a look at this log file for example:</p> <pre><code>Root Process: C:\Users\Unknown_analysis\documents\Unknown\desktop\0e66029132a885143b87b1e49e32663a52737bbff4ab96186e9e5e829aa2915f.exe (PID: 7492) Process created: PID: 1172, ImageName: \??\C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe, CommandLine: &quot;C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe&quot; /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet &amp; wmic shadow

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After 2 years of development, we&#39;ve built an AI-powered antivirus in 2025 that incorporates a <strong>VPN</strong>, <strong>Password Manager</strong> and a built in local <strong>LLM Chatbot</strong> in a GGUF File format optimized for CPU-Only Inference including machine learning models for malware detection, a <strong>Network Intrusion Detection</strong> <strong>system</strong> and <strong>kernel driver</strong> level monitoring for real time protection.</p> <p>After a couple months collecting Hundreds of Millions of Malware samples (totaling <strong>34TBs</strong>) for developing a comprehensive Signature Analysis database and using a small fraction to train a powerful machine learning, model using decision trees and random forest models, we&#39;ve managed to create a Deep Learning Trained Model for Malware detection with these performance metrics:</p> <p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: 0.9925</p> <p><strong>Auc</strong>: 0.9993</p> <p><strong>Loss
