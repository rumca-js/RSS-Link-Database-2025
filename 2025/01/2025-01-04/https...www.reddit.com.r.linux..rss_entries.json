Linux enthusiasts as a group want to support manufacturers that are going to make Linux hardware, we are willing to spend money sometimes even more money than windows or Mac consumers for our hardware to support Linux makers. So can you manufacturers of Linux hardware just stop and make sure your stuff is actually quality and works before you sell it. I am absolutely just done at this point and so friggin annoyed. I bought an S76 laptop I was excited to get it and what did I find... a machine that seemed super brittle, a keyboard with deck flex I have never experienced, and the thing ran so hot even under idle conditions I knew it would just lead to hardware failure. Alright fine maybe that was sort of a fluke so I got a machine from starlabs. Ahh build quality is so nice... Then software issues everywhere. The touchscreen is mid to poor. The pen they sell for it is very inaccurat",
