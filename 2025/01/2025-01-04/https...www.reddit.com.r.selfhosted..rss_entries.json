I landed on net-bird for its relatively small size and to my knowledge, i do not need admin. However, local host is blocked as well. So, i am not able to log in or set up netbird. I tried logging in via CLI using &quot;netbird up&quot;, but that tried to open the localhost aswell. <a href=\"http://netbird.io\">netbird.io</a> is not blocked for whatever reason.

Maybe sometimes just hosting a game server. What would act better for this? A PC Tower which would just act as a server or a NAS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/New-Speaker-2188\"> /u/New-Speaker-2188 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ht123g/newbie_in_selfhosting_need_some_advice_on_what_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ht123g/newbie_in_selfhosting_need_some_advice_on_what_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",
