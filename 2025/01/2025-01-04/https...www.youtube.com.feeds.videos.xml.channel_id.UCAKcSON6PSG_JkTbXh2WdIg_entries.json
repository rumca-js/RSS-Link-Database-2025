        "description": "Watch DEHD perform an acoustic version of \"Light On\" live at The Current\nSupport The Current: https://support.mpr.org/youtube  \n\nChicago indie-rock band DEHD are on a bit of a roll. On their most recent album, Poetry, the three-piece band got a little bit more experimental with their sound \u2014\u00a0something that really came alive as they wrote and recorded songs in a couple of different locations; specifically, in Taos, New Mexico, and on Bainbridge Island in the state of Washington. They also took another new step in bringing a producer into the studio with them. The results proved a bit more creatively satisfying and liberating. \n\nAs further evidence of a more free-wheeling DEHD, the three band members \u2014\u00a0Emily Kempf, Eric McGrady and Jason Balla \u2014\u00a0recorded a three-song acoustic set of songs while visiting The Current studio, eschewing drums and bass for a couple of acoustic guitars to accompany their vocals. Watch them perform \"Light On\" above.\n\nMusicians\nJason Balla \u2013\u00a0guitar, vocals\nEmi",
