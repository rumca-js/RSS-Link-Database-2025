        "description": "Pioner is an upcoming online competitive shooter vying for your attention via its mix of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. style phantasmagoria, survival and crafting mechanics not dissimilar to Fallout, plus a healthy dose of game modes including PvE missions, PvP arenas, and an Escape from Tarkov inspired extraction mode. There\u2019s plenty going on here. \n\nInstead of focusing on a niche, the developer is going all in on cramming as much as they can into their hostile MMORPG FPS, and to reduce the risk of overburdening players they\u2019ve decided to divide the game\u2019s gargantuan 50 square kilometre island open world into gameplay-specific zones. On top of all that there\u2019s a story campaign, plus factions with whom you\u2019ll choose to align or oppose. This could be great should it all meld together.",

        "description": "The law of averages dictates that not every game is going to be able to live up to the promises it makes, but even so, building yourself up for a game that's looking particularly promising, only for it to end up disappointing in more ways than one- that can be a particularly difficult pill to swallow. \n\nSadly, that has happened time and time again over the years, and here, we're going to talk about a few examples that stand out in memory.",
