I&#39;ve always been able to accurately replay a song in my head after only hearing it once. Music is like another sense to me. When I&#39;m very relaxed(or stoned😊) in a quiet space and think of a certain song, I can produce auditory hallucinations and actually hear it for brief moments as if its playing on the radio far away. Just curious if this happens to anyone else? I thought this sub would be the best place to ask.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why Dave Brubeck&#39;s Take Five is so good, but it&#39;s definitely catchy. I want to tap my feet to it. And I guess it&#39;s not as wild and varied as some other jazz songs which true jazz lovers can appreciate but I find too &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;distracting&quot; or something like that. This one sounds simple and repetitive in some ways and has a smooth and cool feel to it which is why I can have it in the background playing while I try to relax in the evening. It doesn&#39;t require a lot of attention, it sort of just enters your soul. As someone said to me once, it&#39;s the music being played while angels serve people drinks in paradise and people dissolve into a state of blissful trance.</p> <p>How should I go about finding other works that are similar but that also gradually help me appreciate more styles of jazz?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/doctorintrainin"> /u/
