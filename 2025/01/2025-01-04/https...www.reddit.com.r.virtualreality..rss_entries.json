What else should I buy to have a similar experience? I found myself playing RM2 as slowly as possible because I didn&#39;t want it to end! I wanted to explore every inch of the areas and really soak in the feeling of actually being there. I want as much of that out of VR as I can get!</p> <p>I also enjoy Walkabout Mini Golf just for the fun/quick gameplay, but I did not like Asgard&#39;s Wrath II and didn&#39;t get very far into it (the areas felt too fake and block-y)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

Quick googling showed that this thing is quite pricie, so now I wonder if there&#39;s a cheaper way to connect this headset to a PC? I already searched for some options and found out that PSVR 2&#39;s adapter doesn&#39;t provide enough power to the headset. Now, I wonder if I can use BS link box or, maybe, some of those active Quest Link cables (those that have additional type-c for power so that the headset doesn&#39;t drain battery while playing) I also looking at some type-c docking stations but I&#39;m not sure if those even theoretically could work. All and all, I would appreciate any advice on this matter. I can&#39;t afford spending $220 for the link box so.. yeah (headset itself appeared in the local pawnshop for $50)</p> <p>Thank you in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/caffeine_squirre",
