<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Post:</p> <p>I run a service-based business where I primarily communicate with clients via text on my iPhone. To stay consistent with my brand‚Äôs voice, I use ChatGPT to help craft responses.</p> <p>The problem is: 1. No Memory Between Chats ‚Äì ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt retain past conversations, so I have to re-explain things constantly. 2. Manual Copy-Pasting ‚Äì I have to copy and paste each message separately, which is tedious. 3. Lack of Integration ‚Äì I wish there was an easier way to generate responses without switching between apps.</p> <p>I‚Äôm looking for an AI tool, automation, or custom solution that could make this process smoother‚Äîideally something that works with iPhone messaging and remembers context better.</p> <p>Has anyone found a good workaround for this? Open to app suggestions or tech solutions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Easy_Low3286"> /u/Easy_Low3286 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://
