My work focuses on the idea that intelligence isn’t static—it’s dynamic, defined by the relationships between nodes, edges, and their evolution over time.</p> <p>I’ve detailed this approach in a recent article, which outlines the role of relational models and graph dynamics in redefining how we und

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. Over the last few months I have been researching some AI solutions to create a digital clone capable of speaking multiple languages. Of the tools I tested, the one I found the coolest was HeyGen. I decided to write a post on my blog telling a little about the experience, the results and the lessons learned. If anyone wants to know more about it, I think it is worth reading.</p> <p>Disclaimer: I didn’t receive any money and neither know anyone who works for this company. I just liked the product. There are many other tools that can generate virtual avatars with good quality, but for my personal reasons, the one that worked better for me was HeyGen.</p> <p><a href="https://saraceni.me/index.php/2025/01/03/app-review-heygen/">https://saraceni.me/index.php/2025/01/03/app-review-heygen/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RafaSaraceni"> /u/RafaSaraceni </a> <br/>
