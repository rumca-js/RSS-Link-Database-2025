I already shared this around, but I might as well share it here too! I made a Gameboy emulator! Even though it is not perfect, It was a fun project to work on! It can run many games like Super Mario Land, Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue/Yellow and Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Sliver, Legend of Zelda Link&#39;s Awaking, Tetris, and so much more. It&#39;s open source, and on my GitHub I have a detailed README (beware of grammar mistake lol) I been receiving amazing support. Thank you! :) <a href=\"https://github.com/BotRandomness/CODE-DMG\">https://github.com/Bot",
