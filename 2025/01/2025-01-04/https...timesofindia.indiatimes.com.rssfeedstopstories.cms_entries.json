Bumrah's 32 wickets in the 2024/25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy surpass Bedi's 31 from the 1977/78 series. India is aiming to tie the series to retain the trophy. Bumrah claimed his 32nd wicket by dismissing Marnus Labuschagne with a length delivery that moved away late, drawing a faint edge to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.",
