<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I’m trying to scrape a site (WyScout) with Selenium.</p> <p>It appears that the site uses dynamic login URL’s (different URL for every session) - I want to automate a login session for navigating into a database within the site but I’m falling at the first Hurdle as I can’t successfully automate a login due to a) the dynamic login above and b) the fact the login system initially needs a username, and then once submitted it takes me to another page.</p> <p>Where is the best place to start for resources in overcoming this?</p> <p>At the moment I’m having to manually take the data, download it and analyse it using Python but I want to automate more of the process.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea-Fly-8807"> /u/Sea-Fly-8807 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1htnagi/dynamic_session_login_with_selenium/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa

I just want the feature that tells me which server someone is in.

I’d appreciate any guidance or suggestions to get started.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre
