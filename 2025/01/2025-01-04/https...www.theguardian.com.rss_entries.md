We will turn this country around and restore the United Kingdom to its rightful position as one of the greatest countries in the world.”</p><p>The speech is met with rapturous applause and a standing ovation at Reform’s East of England conference, held in Kemi Badenoch’s rural North West Essex constituency on Saturday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/04/picture-nigel-farage-as-pm-jubilant-reform-uk-dares-to-dream-at-east-of-england-conference">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unbending coach takes his side to Liverpool on Sunday, with attempts to kick club on undermined by a decade of misrule</p><p>The thought had always been that it couldn’t happen now. It’s just not possible in modern football that a super-club could be relegated. Manchester United may have gone down in 1974 but it’s not going to happen in 2025. Even when Ruben Amorim said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/30/manchester-united-face-really-clear-threat-of-relegation-admits-amorim">United were in a relegation battle</a> after Monday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/30/manchester-united-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">2-0 defeat by Newcastle</a>, he was making the point to shock.</p><p>And it’s not going to happen now. United will not be relegated. They probably only need 15 points from the second half of the season to be safe and the financial structure of modern football means there are at least three sides worse than them.&nbsp

<p>After flood defences failed yet again, heartbroken residents of Merseyside and Cheshire now face a painful clean-up and possible financial ruin</p><p>At about 3.15am on New Year’s Day, Caroline McClymont looked out of her bedroom window at the Sankey brook over the road. It looked a bit fuller than usual – to be expected, given the rain. “But there was nothing out of the ordinary,” McClymont said. “There was no indication it was going to flood.”</p><p>Within an hour, the whole street was under water. The home McClymont, a science lecturer, has owned with her husband Alan, a technician, for 31 years was filled with dirty water, higher than the kitchen countertops. It covered the sofas, washing machine, Christmas tree, everything on the ground floor. The neighbour’s car was submerged. “Everything is destroyed.

<p>If Arsenal are serious about winning the Premier League this season then Mikel Arteta may want to rethink his plans for the January transfer market. This was another two points dropped in the race to keep up with pacesetters Liverpool as a penalty from João Pedro cancelled out Ethan Nwaneri’s second Premier League goal. But it could have been even worse had Fabian Hürzeler’s side taken their chances in a second half when they were much improved.</p><p>Despite extending their unbeaten run in all competitions to 12 matches, Arsenal have become too reliant on their prowess from set pieces and were hanging on at the end in the face of concerted Brighton pressure. Arteta has so far insisted that he is happy with the squad at his disposal yet he surely needs reinforcements in attack given the extended absence of talisman Bukayo Saka and other obstacles that are presenting themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/04/brighton-arsenal-premier-league-match-repo

<p>A burglary in London has triggered a press frenzy but the real story is that today such incidents are rare</p><p>Crime stories serve up a reliable set of emotions – shock, sympathy, horror, outrage, morbid curiosity and fear. But there is something different, I think, about news of a <em>heist. </em>Against your will, in the crime pages of all places, you suddenly find yourself rooting for the villain. The ingenuity! The skill! The sheer improbability that one semi-retired cat burglar could shimmy up a drainpipe in full view of five sleeping XL bullies and still escape with the loot. Will he get away with it? Should he? You’re no longer reading an airport thriller, but a novel of deep moral complexity.</p><p>Let us turn, for example, to the recent heist in Primrose Hill, north London, over which the media has been in a frenzy.

<p>Newcastle duo catch the eye in first Premier League game Thomas Tuchel has attended since contract officially started</p><p>It didn’t take long for the Thomas Tuchel effect to be felt. By the time six minutes had been played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium under the – seemingly quite grumpy – eye of the new England head coach, two English players had scored with excellent finishes, <strong>Dominic Solanke</strong> with a plunging header and <strong>Anthony Gordon</strong> with a calm angled shot. If there were concerns about Gordon’s positioning for Solanke’s goal, they could be excused in the context of a generally excellent defensive performance from Newcastle.</p><p>Nine of the starters were England-qualified, even with <strong>James Maddison</strong> on the bench. Of most interest to Tuchel, perhaps, would have been a Newcastle pairing with which he is already familiar. It was Tuchel who gave <strong>Lewis Hall</strong> his full Chelsea debut, starting him on the left of a ba

<p>Winning derbies is not about the quality of performance, it is about the result and Burnley fans will not be complaining after Zian Flemming earned them the points against bitter rivals Blackburn in a tight but underwhelming encounter. The significance of the victory was indicated at full-time as the players led raucous celebrations after boosting their promotion ambitions.</p><p>The dire nature of the first hour was forgotten, in the away end at least, when Flemming dived to head home Bashir Humphreys’s cross in front of 4,000 Burnley supporters. It was the first opening of note in the match and the Dutchman should be commended for still being alert after having next to no involvement up to that point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/04/blackburn-burnley-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

This year is the eighth anniversary of my mum’s passing, which feels like an interesting time to think: how much have I learned since she died? Growing up, she gave me these great life lessons, which I’ve been applying since she’s not been here. I feel really proud of her, and proud of myself how I’ve handled it.<br><br><strong>Mum was an </strong>incredible woman. She came from a very humble background. It wasn’t until she was dying that I read her secret journals about how tough, neglectful and abusive her childhood had been. But she had this spirit of “I’m going to disregard my limitations and do absolutely everything I can to achieve everything I want to achieve.” She wanted me to be stimulated by culture and beauty and the arts.<

In the background, they’ve probably heard many times from their partner what they need, and have found all sorts of ways to ignore that information because it’s hard for them. One person might be asking for more warmth – to hug once in a while, say – and for all sorts of reasons the other person might be withholding that, or they’re not wired that way. But it’s not such a hard give.

<p>The Downton Abbey star on being a goofy kid, coping with a terrible blow, and why she doesn’t struggle with impostor syndrome</p><p><strong>This photo was taken in my garden in&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cookham</strong><strong>.</strong> I’m in my OshKosh dungarees, holding a half-eaten Funny Feet strawberry swirl ice-cream, and the elaborate butterfly face paint must have been from a school summer fete or a birthday party. As for the hair, I’m rocking some proper tight ringlets. I&nbsp;still rock a tight ringlet, to be honest.</p><p>The information I have about myself from that age is from other people, my parents, mainly. I know that I was very expressive, with no inhibitions. I was apparently pretty spirited and very goofy in general. As much as I enjoyed making people laugh, I was also insanely well behaved and terrified of getting in trouble. That fear also hasn’t changed. I can’t stand being told off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/04/actor-jessic

<p>Psychotherapist, psychoanalyst and author Susie Orbach on how to make a life full of substance and sustenance</p><p>We constantly absorb the idea that we need to be happier, but do we? The word “why” allows us to shift our perspective and think more broadly about why a “happier life” is the imagined goal, rather than a life that has more complexity, meaning and authenticity. In our consumer culture, it’s as though happiness is something we can buy, rather than contentment and interest, which we experience. This focus on happiness can negate what’s going on, how we feel, how many varied things we might be experiencing. That doesn’t make for a very sustainable or interesting life.<br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/04/questions-to-ask-yourself-for-a-more-meaningful-life">Continue reading...</a>

Who wins for quality and flavour, and how much should you spend?</p><p>Tinned tomatoes are wonderful, essential, enduring things: what would we do without them? Of the various types – whole, crushed, pulped, passata – chopped are particularly accommodating, providing a pleasing tomato presence while being easily reduced to sauce, and good value, too. However, chopped tomatoes (unlike whole tomatoes) can also be an excuse for a lesser product and more preservatives, which is why tasting and comparing is essential.</p><p>I always taste tomatoes cold, straight from the tin, with my eyes closed – a helper is useful – because, while deep red chunks and sauce are pleasing, they may have no bearing on flavour. I hope for a good balance of sweet, sour (acidity), salty (savoury), bitter and umami; chunks that are firm without being unduly crunchy or unripe; and a sauce tha

<p>Forget generic self-help advice and focus instead on the unique set of hang-ups, character traits and personal circumstances that stop you living your best life</p><p>One problem with trying to improve your life is that, all too often, the improvements you’re attempting have little to do with <em>your </em>life.

But following the advice of the average self-help book is unlikely to work much better: no matter how wise or sincere its author, it’s vanishingly unlikely they’ve ever met you. Even when a plan for change seems to arise independently, from inside your own mind, it usually takes the form of a fantasy about the person you think you ought to be, or would like to be, into which you then try to squeeze the person you actually are – for a few days, anyway, until the st

<p>Sumit Paul-Choudhury had always prided himself on his critical thinking, until his wife was diagnosed with cancer and he was forced to rethink his life from scratch</p><p>People reacted in different ways to my wife Kathryn’s diagnosis: an aggressive, fast-spreading ovarian cancer discovered after the miscarriage that ended our first and only&nbsp;pregnancy. A few understood that her future was likely to be grim and short; those people mostly kept quiet or stayed away. But many professed to believe that things would somehow work out – sometimes out of superstition, sometimes out of a desire to reassure, but most often simply because they could think of no other&nbsp;way to react.</p><p>Kathryn, for her part, insisted that those around her – her family, her friends, her colleagues and her doctors – only express hope. Naturally, that applied to me most of all, but I struggled to know how to accommodate her&nbsp;wishes. On the one hand, I’d always been inclined to look on the bright s

<p>Nourishing, simple meals are what a new year calls for, and this feelgood soup is ready in less than an hour</p><p>I am a sucker for new year rituals. In Colombia, it’s traditional to run around with an empty suitcase to invite a year filled with adventure, but, personally, I prefer to start the year with a fitness challenge. This year’s is an ab-focused one, in the hope that I’ll get the type of muscles you could play a drum solo on. When it comes to cooking, meanwhile, and after the heaviness of festive food, I like something nourishing but undemanding, and inevitably that means soup. This week’s is a simple recipe that involves a stir, a boil, with the last step – and my favourite new ritual – being to add some readymade frozen wontons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/04/vegan-quickish-wonton-soup-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This elegiac novel tracks a West Indian man’s life in London over decades, exploring the emotional cost of leaving home and being met by hatred and rejection</p><p>Will the last one out please turn off all the lights?” This was the joke that spread across the West Indies in the 1950s and 60s as young adults succumbed to “England Fever” in their determination to migrate to Britain. Having saved enough for his ticket from Saint Kitts, Victor Johnson, the protagonist of Another Man in the Street, has his finger on the light switch at the start of Caryl Phillips’s elegiac novel. From his debut, 1985’s The Final Passage, Phillips has steadfastly focused on the precarious lives of migrants in novels such as In the Falling Snow and in his hybrid work Foreigners: Three English Lives. His books have stood out against other accounts of the Windrush generation’s stoicism, exploring the emotional cost of leaving home and being met by hatred and rejection.</p><p>The transatlantic journey was a
