<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My partner is making a small kids library. I want to make a scanner (mobile app?), that takes a photo of the book, tries to guess the title from the image, creates a record in a db and generates a QR code that I can send to a label printer, then she can scan them in and out or at least do a stock count for books going missing etc. how hard would it be to put this together? Where would you start? What would you use?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HighlightNo558"> /u/HighlightNo558 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ht7wcr/i_have_an_idea_but_no_clue_where_to_start/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ht7wcr/i_have_an_idea_but_no_clue_where_to_start/">[comments]</a></span>
