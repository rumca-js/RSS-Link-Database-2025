<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty new to board games. Played simple ones growing up, and found this game recently to play with my little guys (both under 12) who loved it. I even really like it and played with one of my friends.</p> <p>Models are incredible, rules are simple enough but games are kept different with random turns, various special abilities, different maps, different levels of difficulty and a small campaign mode. It has enough depth and some small strategies where experience can help, and variations allow for replay value rather than one dominant strategy that runs the game (like Junior Catan).</p> <p>Maybe its the nostalgia factor where I played WH40k over a decade ago and love the universe, but the game is whole in itself which is rare for a GW game. </p> <p>Branching out to look for others I could play with my little guys that are similar if you all have any recommendations! Prefer:</p> <ul> <li>Coop. Encourage teamwork with each other</li> <li>Proble

This sounds like it’s right up my alley. However, in my research into it I am aware that there were significant changes made to the game between the 2nd and 3rd editions.</p> <p>All of the forums I have read get very heated about which one is better but none actually explain what the differences are. As someone who is new to the board game scene I don’t really have any experience with other games that people have compared it to, my question is what are the actual differences between the two versions?</p> <p>Some secondary questions:</p> <p>Is the 1st edition not worth discussing? It almost seems like it doesn’t exist base

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One thing i think it&#39;s underrated from the BGG pages, is the language dependence for games. Interesting feature not many people even know it exists.</p> <p>Well, because i was a fan of No ROlls Barred, i saw them playing Poetry for Neanderthals, about describing things in one syllable. I want to play that game, but is so dependent on the english language and talk, with their complex and borderline nonsensical way of talking and describing what is a syllable, but i&#39;m spanish and we have very defined strict and short syllables that makes that game impossible for me to play.</p> <p>Are there other games like that, where they&#39;re basically only playable in one language?

You play one card at the banquet table, one on an opponent, and one on yourself. The cards played at the banquet table determine weather the cards played on yourself and opponents will count as points or negative points (based on the position “above” or below the table in a simple majority at the end of the round.)</p> <p>There are also “special cards” that allow cards to be played in secret (face down), remove cards, double points, and non removable cards, but at its core the idea that if the “red house” is currently negative and you play a red

I’ve looked into <em>Aeon Trespass Odyssey</em>, and it looks interesting, but I’m not sure if I like the combat. Are there other games with great stories that you’d recommend?</p> <p>Also, has anyone tried the solo or co-op story mode in <em>Aridnyk</em>? It seems unique since you explore Carpathian folklore through a tile-placement game. Does the story change each time? How’s the challenge and immersion?

All I can remember is this: - It is a card game that is based on a webcomic similar to Cyan*de and Happiness (originally I thought it‘s based in that one but cannot find it among the list of games from that franchise). The overall card design is white with a text of the action (e.g. „Pick up all cards“) at the top and a cartoon at the bottom. So the cards look just like a cartoon panel. I believe someone said this webtoon even made it to Youtube or originated from there but am not sure. - The goal is to get rid of all your cards. I cannot remembee for sure but I believe you can only put down all cards if you have collected a certain number of cards (I think 7 or 10). - Each card performs an action, either you are allowed to pick up/drop/exchange cards or you can attack other players/everyone -There were cards that coul

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I recently watched this parallel universe themed movie called Coherence (2013), and it got me thinking about mind-bending, &quot;hard-to-grasp&quot; concepts that are also featured prominently in many Christopher Nolan movies for example. I love how these stories challenge your understanding of reality and make you piece together complex ideas.</p> <p>This made me wonder: is it possible to recreate that same mind-blowing feeling in a board game? Could a game use themes like time travel, parallel universes, or other brain-twisting mechanics to deliver a truly unique and challenging experience that really works as a mechanic, not only as a fancy theme?</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts, or even examples of games that successfully achieve this kind of mental gymnastics.</p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/viiktor22"> /u/viiktor22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://w
