<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m about halfway through The Book of the New Sun. I&#39;ve always been a big fan of Sun Eater series and while I knew it wasn&#39;t exactly original, I didn&#39;t realize exactly how derivative Ruocchio&#39;s storytelling is. I was gobsmacked when Severian listed the seven forms of governance in chapter 33 of <em>Shadow of the Torturer</em>, that it was taken and used multiple times in Sun Eater. Looking back on it now, I&#39;ve realized how much of Ruocchio&#39;s work was just what Wolfe did, with three times the page count and ten times the melodrama.</p> <p>Have you ever experienced something similar?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/103813630"> /u/103813630 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1htqzcq/has_reading_a_book_ever_retroactively_soured_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1htqzcq/has_reading_a_book

But if you wade through the current of sorrow long enough there&#39;s tiny moments of joy to be found, and from those tiny moments are built bigger moments, until your hobbies come back to you and the world starts to exist in the colors of varying emotions.

The protagonist just suddenly turns into the prodigy of the camp, doing things the book said he couldn’t do 30 pages ago.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s a certain itch that I have that can only be scratched by a certain type of story; one that you&#39;d usually find on youtube narrated by the usual creepypasta narrators with titles like &quot;I hunt Wendigos for a living&quot; or something like that. Unfortunately, they are usually one-offs and incredibly short. I would like something in that realm that is available as a physical book (preferably one of decent length). One thing I personally don&#39;t like a lot about most urban fantasy is that they take away the wonder and the horror of supernatural entities and makes them feel too natural and normal if that makes sense. At the same time, I&#39;m not a fan of the way that most horror books make such entities too alien and abnormal and something you cannot fight against. I want something of a balance in between. For example, imagine something like The Mortal Instruments but the protagonist is a normal human with no connection to the su

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey gang, need some help finding a fantasy read, as I have a hard time settling in with new books, and I’m tired of rereading things. MC should be an adult, please. No coming of age, no magic school. I have no problem with romantic relationships, but do not care to read stories centered on them. No explicit sexual content, please. Rich, developed character, who act in ways that make sense for who they are I like a setting with magic, but I prefer that it be something rare and powerful, and as mysterious to the MC as it is to me. No “transported to another world,” no time travel, no fairy realms. Deep history is a plus, but the <em>sense</em> of that history is a lot more important than having it spelled out. The writing itself is very important for me, but also hard to define and somewhat subjective. I need good narrative flow, and dialogue should be smooth and natural. It should sound like people talking, not actors on a stage delivering lines. I ha

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Prior to this novel, I&#39;d never read Gene Wolfe. The Wizard Knight was such a thoroughly singular experience that I kind of struggle to even sort through my own thoughts about it. I loved it in a weird way because it somehow felt both generic and totally unique. My memory of it is almost dreamlike.</p> <p>Throughout much of the books I felt like I was reading a bog standard fantasy adventure but it&#39;s like all of the conventional ideas that would accompany it were sometimes shattered, turned inside out, refracted onto an unexpected path. The way he saturates familiar fantasy concepts with other pieces of mythology was so intriguing and made things like &quot;elves&quot; and &quot;dragons&quot; seem almost alien.</p> <p>Reading these books felt like reading ancient epics, not just in their content, but in the writing style.
