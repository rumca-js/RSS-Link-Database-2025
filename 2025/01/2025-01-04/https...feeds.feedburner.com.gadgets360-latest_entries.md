Tristan da Cunha, a volcanic island group in the South Atlantic, is home to 250 people in a settlement called Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. Surrounded by rugged terrain and unique wildlife like northern rockhopper penguins, it offers a glimpse into Earth's geological and ecological history. Its isolation is so profound that reaching it involves a six-day boat journey from South Africa. The island’s volcanic origins trace back to Gondwana’s breakup, making it a site of both historical and natural intrigue
