<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still learning English, so when i watch a movie without subtitles, all i hear is the Tasmanian Devil. With subtitles i can recognize the words</p> <p>I’ve seen many young people online saying they can’t understand movies without subtitles. I was surprised that this seems to be a gen Z thing, but no answers to why we can&#39;t hear it</p> <p>I think the audio editing in today’s movies also doesn’t help. The sound effects are way too loud, and the dialogue is too quiet, you can’t watch without the remote in hand</p> <p>I watched a movie from the 90s this week and, god, the actors spoke so much more clearly. Even with lower audio quality and expressions i didn’t know it was much easier to understand than recent films. It seems like actors nowadays are speaking in cursive, always mumbling</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Upstairs-Fondant-360"> /u/Upstairs-Fondant-360 </a> <br/> <span><a href="

The Meredith boat scene, meeting Marge at the opera, the PI at Dickie&#39;s dad place, Marge &amp; the rings, meltdown at the boat with Dickie, The Italian detective, last Freddie scene, and that&#39;s not even all of them.</p> <p>One other question, were we supposed to assume a lot of days passed in between every scene when Tom, Dickie &amp; Marge were friends?</p> <p>I felt like they got along like very good friends very fast.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Suitable_Candy_1161"> /u/Suitable_Candy_1161 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1htqu27/the_talented_mr_ripley_1999_left_me_uncomfortable/">[link]</

## Visually timeless films? Like you could watch it and be unable to say “oh yeah that was definitely filmed in the 90’s.”

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hopefully the question makes sense. I’m not talking about “timeless” in terms of the subject matter of a film, but rather the visuals of the film. Whether it be because of the camera shots, the color grading, etc. </p> <p>For example, out of The Lord of the Rings films, The Two Towers and The Return of the King seem visually timeless to me, but The Fellowship of the Ring seems to have a look to it that makes me think “yeah I can tell that this was filmed in 1999.” (Which is confusing because all 3 films were filmed at once.)</p> <p>I suppose my question would obviously not apply to recent films as obviously they would be timeless because of their proximity to the current day.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Philosopherskin"> /u/Philosopherskin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1htqkf1/visually_timeless_films_like_you_could_watch_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>

## Are you more forgiving of movies if the cast and crew are giving all they got and are clearly enjoying themselves?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context I grew up on Hong Kong and other Asians film that outside of your big hits like Protect A etc. are b grade flair even the cast and crew fully admit that many of those films were shlock but as many of them said those films were made with a shoestring budget, tight time tables and a lot of times incomplete scripts they had to wing it. None the less they put their best foot forward and have fun with it. Partly because as I learned watching interviews unless you were a big star part of your pay depended on how well the movie does and if you are in movie at all so you couldn&#39;t phone in. That plus the fact that you work with the same people over and over who often times live in the same area run a side business that everyone goes to etc. So, for me even if the movie is bad if the actors and crew are giving their all and enjoying themselves I can forgive it and in many cases enjoy it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve gotten super into the films that make you feel like garbage. Not in the way of a usual sad movie like Schindler&#39;s List , Green Mile, et cetera, but ones that really appeal to a relatable sorrow tone and leave you with a bad aftertaste. I&#39;m talking movies like Krisha, Trainspotting, Anomalisa, I Saw The TV Glow, most Lars Von Trier movies, ones like that.</p> <p>What are the best/ your favorite movies that make you feel like crap in a grounded or relatable way? The last post I saw discussing these kinds of films is about 6 years old, and I wanted to hear what people think nowadays. My personal favorite is probably Krisha (go figure since I already mentioned it) since it does a great job portraying the negatives of recovery and how hard it is.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flutterbuzzy"> /u/flutterbuzzy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just want to take a moment and appreciate Harrison Ford. In my opinion, he is the best every man action hero that I can recall in cinema. His most iconic characters aren’t the best of the best at every single thing. Even when he wins the fight, he usually has taken a beating throughout and barely manages to make it out alive. The fight choreography is really clumsy, just like how an everyman character should be. I personally love when he throws a haymaker and almost falls over.</p> <p>Indiana Jones is an academic first and foremost. Deckard is a cop. Han is a smuggler. Jack Ryan is an analyst. His characters find themselves in extraordinary circumstances but you never find their involvement unbelievable. His character is just lucky to make it to see another day. They show confidence in the skills they should and he perfectly portrays when he’s out of his depth. His character finds themselves grit to go on because it’s the right thing to do, but he

Now I just noticed that a Director&#39;s Cut exists, which leaves me twisted: I&#39;m kinda interested to see whether that cut makes up for the weaknesses of the original... But then again I wouldn&#39;t wanna waste yet another 3,5 hours.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p> Brooding characters like Oliver Queen, Stefan Salvatore, Eric Draven from <em>The Crow (2024)</em>, or Wolverine often dominate discussions about &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;edgy&quot; personas. These characters are intense, mysterious, and emotionally guarded, which seems to make them magnetic to fans. Even when they aren&#39;t the main characters, they tend to steal the spotlight and become some of the most talked-about individuals in their respective shows or movies.</p> <p>But it got me thinking—would these traits actually translate well to real-life social dynamics? If someone acted like Oliver or Stefan in terms of personality—quiet, serious, emotionally distant, and maybe even a little angsty—would they still be likable? Would people find them intriguing or just plain exhausting to be around?</p> <p>For example, could a brooding, intense personality work at a party or in a friend group, or would they come across as aloof or off-putting?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finally watched John Carpenter&#39;s The Thing for the first time and was blown away from the opening shot, which was brilliant. It&#39;s is a masterclass in paranoia-driven horror, elevated by groundbreaking practical effects that remain iconic. It&#39;s creeping sense of distrust with the crew is amazing. It also expertly fosters an atmosphere of escalating tension, where no one can be trusted and every glance or hesitation deepens the dread. The practical effects by Rob Bottin are astonishingly.

The trailer can be deceiving, so can be comments from fans and critical reviewers. </p> <p>But there been situations I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised, where I initially read the premise and thought I&#39;ll skip it because the premise sounded bad (boring, stupid, extreme, absurd) but ended up seeing it years later on TV and I was like Wow, can&#39;t believe that premise worked!</p> <p>Case in point the movie Lobster. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s my favorite but it was definitely worth watching. And the premise is so weird. It&#39;s about a bunch of people forced to pick a romantic partner in a short time because the alternative is they will turn into animals. Of course you can laugh at it but it&#39;s played serious, which creates a situation that is absurd and yet you can&#39;t look away from it. </p> <p>It&#39;s almost like

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I always like to stay for the end credit scene, whether there is one or not. Even before end credit scenes were a common thing, I always like to watch the credits because it gives me some time to think about the movie and wind down before heading out. (Plus I don&#39;t have to leave in a big crowd of people.) I also feel like the point of credits is to watch them and care about the work that went into the project. I also like seeing the song titles/performers and the special thanks stuff.</p> <p>So generally it&#39;s not a big deal for me to stick around until the end and not be rewarded with an end credit scene. But I do know there have been moments when I&#39;ve waited, and an end credit scene did happen, which would get me excited for something cool or interesting, and then the actual scene was a little lame or pointless. No specifics come to mind right now, but I thought I&#39;d ask and see if any of you have had an end scene that made you madder

What if Indiana Jones had two perfectly average sequels after The Last Crusade? </p> <p>The Last Crusade ended with the heroes <em>literally</em> riding off into the sunset. And after seeing this movie 6 times, try as I might, I cannot figure out how the <em>Last</em> part of the title references the plot of the actual movie. So it feels like the ending and the title itself all tell the audience that this is Indiana Jones&#39; happy ending. </p> <p>With such a symbolically conclusive ending, a philosophical line has to be drawn.
