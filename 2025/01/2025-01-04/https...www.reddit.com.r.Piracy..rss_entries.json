What is the best media player now? I digged up a bit and got mixed results. Some people said mpv, kodi, PotPlayer with MadVR, mpc hc.... I tried mpv and kodi and they gave different image quality so I dont really know how the movie is supposed to look anymore </p> <p>Also, the thing is my laptop screen does not support HDR so plan to watch this movie on the TV. What is the best method of doing this? I am so confused about the setups, I thought I just need to plugged in the HDMI cable and screen on the TV.

Fitgirl only has one for switch, and it&#39;s the same on other megathread sources from what I&#39;ve seen (if it even has the game at all). It&#39;s the only game I&#39;ve seen this with. I would understand it if it was an exclusive to switch game like mario or something, but this is a game that is actively for sale on the steam store so kinda weird that only the switch version seems to be up everywhere right?
