Namely things like StarCraft, Halo Wars, and Age of Empires II.</p> <p>I have all of these on my PC, but between multiple launchers (ugh) and the fact that I\u2019m transitioning to a desk job next week, I\u2019d like to spend some time on a comfy recliner using a controller. Do y\u2019all know of any games similar to the ones I mentioned on the PS store? I\u2019m apprehensive to purchase anything without due research and unfortunately I find the PS store sorting and reviewing options to be horrendously lackluster.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gingrbredman90\"> /u/gingrbredman90 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1htpk14/ps5_rts_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comm",

Rather than play progression being linear or finding a path of &#39;optimal&#39; builds, you&#39;re given more options to work with, and the ability to entirely switch up what you&#39;re running over time. You can play alongside a friend and you&#39;ll both come up with entirely different builds. You could come up with a build around an aesthetic theme and potentially still whip ass.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been on the hunt for other games from past and present that allow the same kind of creative build expression, I&#39;ve really enjoyed working through the <em>Mega Man Battle Network</em> and <em>Star Force</em> series, <em>Monster Hunter</em>, the recent <em>Cassette Beasts</em> and was pleasantly surprised to see that itch scratched in <em>Metaphor ReFantazio</em> with",

I\u2019ll definitely be coming back to it with mods later in the year. Hopefully there\u2019s an extended storyline mod as I love the story and immersion in games. </p> <p>My goal for the year is to play more single player games and I\u2019m looking for any suggestions to add to my list. I have a list already that includes the red dead games as well as the god of war games. I recently replayed fallout 3 for the tv show and I\u2019ll replay new Vegas for season 2. I also replayed gta 4 recently and I\u2019m planning to save replaying gta 5 when 6 is around the corner. Another series of games I had in mind was the assassin creed games as they were a childhood favorite of mine and there are a handful of them I\u2019ve",

I very much rather find about your game when I have the expectation to play it. I remember when Hollow Knight shadow dropped on Switch, never heard of the game before, instantly bought it and it was one of my favorite games ever.</p> <p>And then they announced Silksong. Coming soon, they said. It&#39;s been 6 years. At this point I just developed hate on the devs.</p> <p>At TGA, I loved when Split fiction was announced and I was like, man by the time they release this, I&#39;ll have kids or something.

Are there any games that allow you freedom of choice, that have unique rewards/paths/endings for staying in the middle of moral and ethical choices? To my knowledge all games that do this exist on the good/evil spectrum, with good or bad endings and rewards tied in to stereotypically good or evil traits, and no ends that are unique for the middle, rather just spectrums of how good or how evil I was, all of which can be done by committing to good or evil in other playthroughs.</p> <p>I like to think when I do these games, my characters have a good heart and usually do the right thing - but I insist on payment. I expect to be paid for my deeds. If I choose an evil quest, I like to believe it is one that is a victimless crime and doesn&#39;t directly hurt people.
