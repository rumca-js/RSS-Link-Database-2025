<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings!</p> <p>So recently I&#39;ve had a game live rent-free in my head and I can&#39;t seem to figure out what it was.</p> <p>It was a first person RPG game, a dungeon crawler. I played a demo/preview of it decades ago and I don&#39;t remember much about it but at the end it had a teaser/promo thing about defeating or finding the rat king (or something like that).<br/> I remember it also had some door-thingies where you had to type in the answer to a question, and one of them gave a riddle and asked &quot;what/who am I?&quot; and I rememeber the answer was &quot;death&quot;.</p> <p>Hope someone here might know what I&#39;m talking about, sorry I can&#39;t recall more. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CaligoVereor"> /u/CaligoVereor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1htquyy/help_me_remember_an_old_game_dos_dungeon_crawler/">[link]</a></sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, II am trying to find the name of (and hopefully images) of a golf game I played on the PC in the late 80&#39;s or early 90&#39;s. The game let you play courses and also design your own. When designing, you picked the type of ground (fairway, bunker, rough) and put squares on the screen. When you saved, it would try and smooth them out. I think it was before VGA. Also, when you started the game, it showed you a hole from a course. You had to match the hole to a page in the user manual. This was to &quot;try&quot; to prevent you from copying the game. Does this sound familiar to anyone? If not, are there other subreddits that might help to identify it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/regression4"> /u/regression4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1htitvg/golf_game_identification/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>People are gonna hate me for this but i believe that Vectorman is overblown, at least with graphics. People hype it up to being some DKC killer but Vectorman isn&#39;t even comparable to DKC in graphical quality in my eyes. While it did do some stuff better like smoother animations and fantastic lighting, it comes at the cost of making the sprites extremely ugly. Like, they are literately just orbs. DKC&#39;s models haven&#39;t aged the best but at least they look normal. The actual graphics themselves are really nothing special, the pre rendered sprites being the real reason that people are dragged towards the game. DKC is superior in nearly every other way and it&#39;s not even close. There are also much better looking games on the genesis like Earthworm Jim and Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SatisfactionCheap627"> /u/SatisfactionCheap627 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some of you seem to spend a lot of time gaming.</p> <p>I was very much into gaming as a kid, at least until I went to college. During college, I didn&#39;t game at all, and then sorta got back into it after for a while. In more recent years, gaming is more of a &quot;special occasion&quot; (i.e. long weekend or winter break thing) than something I do regularly. </p> <p>If I&#39;m being honest, most of my entertainment time is consumed by youtube, TV, movies, reading, web surfing, etc. I guess it doesn&#39;t help that I spend my workday staring at a screen. I pretty much have to do some physical activity after the work day is done (workout or walk). </p> <p>I&#39;d like to do more gaming but time is limited and there are so many options for retro gaming let alone anything newer. I have an NES, SNES, PS2, PS3, and Switch. I have a ton of games that just sit and collect dust. Every game has a learning curve and some can be time consuming.</p> <p>Anyway.
