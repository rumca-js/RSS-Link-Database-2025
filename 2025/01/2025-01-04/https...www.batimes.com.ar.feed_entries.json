While he is eccentric and has a bizarre relationship with his sister and his \u201cfour-legged children,\u201d ultimately he will converge toward more or less the same avenues of behaviour as his predecessors. His perfect armour will begin to exhibit chinks at some time, and his infallibility will become exactly the opposite. It\u2019s a matter of time.  <a href=\"https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/is-javier-milei-an-outlier-or-just-another-normal-politician.phtml\">Leer m\u00e1s</a>",
