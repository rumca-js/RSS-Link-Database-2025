<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi guys, so exactly as the title says. i’m (23) an enby who’s been using strictly they/them for about five years now. one of my good friends (21, he him) misgendered me at a party. he’s only known me for about five months. it hurt my feelings, and we talked about it. he claims he was “just drunk” and would never do it on purpose, and that he doesn’t have a lot of they/them friends so he’s not used to saying it. do i have any right to be upset? as someone who doesn’t use assigned at birth pronouns, i never expected this from him. what makes it worse is that im currently going through a lot of dysphoria, which he’s aware of, and i was meeting a lot of new people. so for him to misgender in that time really sucked because all of the new people now know me as she/her, even though i tried to correct it. i just need some advice on what to do, he’s mad at me and said he needs space. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just love that my family decided to let me believe my aunt was a man rather than tell me that some women love other women. I just accepted the fact that my aunt was a man (very progressive indeed). I was probably 14 when I figured out that she was a woman, and maybe 17 when I connected the dots that <em>maybe, just maybe,</em> her &quot;friend&quot; (the one she lived with and shared a bed with) was more than just a friend.</p> <p>So my freaking gaydar isn’t working.

## Cis-women from Australia; Do men call you “mate”?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know the term ‘mate’ gets used quite a bit in Australia, especially among men, but I don’t usually see girls get called ‘mate’. So I’m sort of just wondering if it’s a term used by everyone for everyone or just used for men.</p> <p>I work in retail in Adelaide, South Australia. I am Apagender, and do not care what people call me by, but I find a lot of my customers call me “mate”. For example:</p> <p>Me: “Aright, here you go. Have a nice day.”</p> <p>Male customer: “Thanks, mate, you too.”</p> <p>I guess in general I look very androgynous, I have very short hair, and have an androgynous voice too.</p> <p>So I’m just wondering if anyone else has an experience like mine?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MMIF10"> /u/MMIF10 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ht3ag2/ciswomen_from_australia_do_men_call_you_mate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.
