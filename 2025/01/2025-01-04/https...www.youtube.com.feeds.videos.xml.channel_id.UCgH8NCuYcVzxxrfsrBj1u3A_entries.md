It's the start of a New Year - and a Happy one to you! But to mark it, I'm doing something different.
On Monday 6 Jan at 8.30pm GMT, I'll be doing a live episode during which I'll be debuting the video for "I Hate Myself" - the latest single by The Darkness. And I want YOU to review it. You might like it, you might hate it, you might love the hair, but I want to know and I'll be reacting to your comments alongside my brother Dan. 
This year, I'm going to be reviewing a lot more music and I wanted to thank you for all of your suggestions - I've read them, I've kept them and I can't wait to do more. 

So please join me on Monday 6 Jan at 8.30pm GMT for a live New Year viewing party. Let's Do This!
