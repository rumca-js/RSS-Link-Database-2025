## "All Over But the Shoutin'" is an incredibly beautiful and poetic memoir

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>By Rick Bragg, Pulitzer prize-winning journalist. </p> <p>It&#39;s the true story of the son of a single mother who picked cotton to raise her 3 sons in rural Alabama. One of those little boys goes on to win a Pulitzer Prize. This story is told from Rick&#39;s point of view, but he uses his beautiful prose to make it as though you&#39;re viewing it through the eyes of his mother. A beautiful and dignified look at life in the middle of nowhere. This one will stick with you. I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough. </p> <p>I know that it was certainly popular at some point, as Bragg is fairly well-known, but I have never seen this book on any lists of great memoirs and it deserves to be there. Bragg has grabbed the English language by the horns and bent it to his will to craft images and feelings that jump straight off the page. I finished reading it, then I did the audiobook because I wanted to visit it again. The narrator Frank Muller somehow improves

There is no complexity to her behavior - An absolutely awful plot that made little to no sense. The characters’ motivations were silly and trite. The pacing was too slow and too fast at the same time. - Boring prose with no effort at interesting sentence structure, imagery, etc. - A boring ending </p> <p>Thoughts? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ColdestWintersChill"> /u/ColdestWintersChill </a> <b

## Literature where a character rises from working class to upper or even middle class without being punished in the end?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It feels like a lot of literature seems to treat social class as basically a natural order that ambition corrupts. So you rarely see a story of someone born working class rising through hard work or other honest means up the class ladder without an ending that makes it clear they should not have tried to do this.</p> <p>Like Vanity Fair - Becky&#39;s ambition is notably reviled - she ends up despised by her friends and suspected of murder.</p> <p>Great Expectations has the most movement in both directions - Pip starts out working class, has his few years of being an upper middle class gentleman - and then returns to being a working class/lower middle class clerk. He explicitly learns that his clothes and money didn&#39;t make him a gentleman - he was never one of them. Estella is born into the working class, adopted into the upper class, she ends up suffering for her marriage to a gentleman and finishes up probably lower middle class. Their rises are

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried searching old posts and didn&#39;t find anything fitting my specific query so wanted to get people&#39;s opinions. I&#39;m on a lifelong quest to read the classics. I&#39;ve got a &quot;bucket list&quot; of 100, and it&#39;s not a competition, the list is meant to be a lifelong journey, and I&#39;ve quite enjoyed tackling the classics and gotten a lot of joy out of them. </p> <p>That being said, I&#39;ll be he honest, even my favorite classics were a slog at some points, especially since the pace and language are often very different from today&#39;s books/media. Even if I haven&#39;t always enjoyed the book, I can <em>sometimes</em> still appreciate the historical context and what the author was trying to say. For example, I recently finished The Sun Also Rises and found the characters miserable and the story mid. However, I can appreciate Hemingway&#39;s writing style and what he was trying to say about The Silent Generation and their PTSD

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s me but being interrupted while I&#39;m in the middle of a book has a tendency to make me angry, worst when it&#39;s making me wasting time and the person ask me to do something while I&#39;m the middle of reading something (I can clean after I&#39;m done reading not while). The issue is I just can&#39;t restart where I was before I got interrupted since I forgot, so I waste time restarting where I started reading before the interruption. I also consider that verry impolite. Something that&#39;ll make me show anger is also if the person kept interrupting me after i explicitly told multiple times I don&#39;t like that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thebunkerparodie"> /u/Thebunkerparodie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1htfbdd/who_else_hate_being_interrupted_in_the_middle_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love reading. And other from the obvious fact that reading is good, I can&#39;t stop to wonder if books maybe aren&#39;t that special. Books usually have around 200-500 pages some more, some less. But did you ever had a book suggestion about a book people told you about, you didn&#39;t read? I did often. Usually always. People tell me how deep, emotional, strong and fearfully a book is. But when I look it up, look at the cover and read the description, I don&#39;t start reading it. The cover doesn&#39;t look good and the description isn&#39;t in my interest. So I just don&#39;t read it. Even if it could change my whole life. Poetry is short. But meaningful, emotional and deep. But I read poetry. Because its short and it holds everything a hook could hold and more. And I say this as a reader. So many people don&#39;t read books beacuse it is a long process and often. The story doesn&#39;t hold what we want. Now I&#39;m thinking if we as readers ofte

Fantastic ending and imaginative scenes (especially the horse racing meet).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I find Bernhard to be really fascinating. In a way he is like Beckett; but, while Endgame, Waiting for Godot, and so on seem to bludgeon you over the head with the central thesis (I love Beckett, so this is only a minor criticism), it is often much more difficult to unravel exactly what Bernhard is trying to say with these 3-page rants. Normally, I&#39;d find this type of writing tedious, but in the hands of Bernhard I find myself completely engrossed. It&#39;s not simply for the fact that it reads like a peek into the mind of Schopenhauer on a bad day (which I do love), it is something about the writing itself. There is something about these long rants with their lack of punctuation that seems to draw the reader in (or at least it did in my experience). </p> <p>For those who have read Bernhard and had a similar experience, what was it about his writing that hooked you in?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.
