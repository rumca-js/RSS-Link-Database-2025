## Customizing Miniflux to Add Custom Sorting

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been using Miniflux as my feed reader for a couple of years now. It is intentionally minimalistic, and hence it lacks certain features. One thing that I sorely miss is the capability to sort the feed entries by various criteria like entry reading time etc. Thankfully, Miniflux lets users customize the UI by injecting custom JavaScript code via settings, so I created my own custom sorter.</p> <p>I wrote a post explaining the options, along with the code: <a href="https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2025/customizing-miniflux">https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2025/customizing-miniflux</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/abhin4v"> /u/abhin4v </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1htc00g/customizing_miniflux_to_add_custom_sorting/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1htc00g/customizing_miniflux_to_add_custom_sorting/">[comments]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://yoptio.com">https://yoptio.com</a></p> <p>For a few years now, I have been using a small RSS reader I built into my personal website. After trying to use a number of other readers, I kept coming back to mine - because I had added the ability to filter out articles with certain words in the headlines (such as &quot;supreme court&quot; or &quot;election&quot;). I thought others might find the format useful and split it out into its own website. Feel free to try it and let me know what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/techphyre"> /u/techphyre </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ht3i3e/yoptio_a_new_rss_reader_with_headline_filtering/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ht3i3e/yoptio_a_new_rss_reader_with_headline_filtering/">[comments]</a></span>
