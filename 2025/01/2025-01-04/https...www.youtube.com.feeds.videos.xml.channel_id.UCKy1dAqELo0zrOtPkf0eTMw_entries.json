        "description": "Amid what appeared to be a lackluster year for new Star Wars content in 2024, 2025 is looking to be just as thin, at least for live-action. That\u2019s not to say the content will be on the same level. With the live-action season 2 of Andor on the horizon, the show alone might be enough to carry the year in terms of what we get from Star Wars, as season 1 of Andor was among some of the highest rated Star Wars releases throughout the franchise\u2019s history. \n\nWhile live-action Star Wars does appear to be thin, though this doesn\u2019t account for Skeleton Crew finishing off its first season run in the front half of January 2025, other forms of media will have Star Wars fans eating well. Expect loads of new Star Wars books and comics centered around the High Republic. Marvel is also cooking up a good run of Star Wars comics throughout the year. The medium that may hurt the most is Star Wars video games. We only know of some games in development, like EA\u2019s third Jedi game, Quantic Dreams\u2019 Star Wars:",
