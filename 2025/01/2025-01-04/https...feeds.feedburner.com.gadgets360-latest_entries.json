Surrounded by rugged terrain and unique wildlife like northern rockhopper penguins, it offers a glimpse into Earth's geological and ecological history. Its isolation is so profound that reaching it involves a six-day boat journey from South Africa. The island\u2019s volcanic origins trace back to Gondwana\u2019s breakup, making it a site of both historical and natural intrigue",
