With subtitles i can recognize the words</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen many young people online saying they can\u2019t understand movies without subtitles. I was surprised that this seems to be a gen Z thing, but no answers to why we can&#39;t hear it</p> <p>I think the audio editing in today\u2019s movies also doesn\u2019t help. The sound effects are way too loud, and the dialogue is too quiet, you can\u2019t watch without the remote in hand</p> <p>I watched a movie from the 90s this week and, god, the actors spoke so much more clearly. Even with lower audio quality and expressions i didn\u2019t know it was much easier to understand than recent films. It seems like actors nowadays are speaking in cursive, always mumbling</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Upstairs-Fondant-360\"> /u/Upstairs-Fondant-360 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",

None the less they put their best foot forward and have fun with it. Partly because as I learned watching interviews unless you were a big star part of your pay depended on how well the movie does and if you are in movie at all so you couldn&#39;t phone in. That plus the fact that you work with the same people over and over who often times live in the same area run a side business that everyone goes to etc. So, for me even if the movie is bad if the actors and crew are giving their all and enjoying themselves I can forgive it and in many cases enjoy it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

Not in the way of a usual sad movie like Schindler&#39;s List , Green Mile, et cetera, but ones that really appeal to a relatable sorrow tone and leave you with a bad aftertaste. I&#39;m talking movies like Krisha, Trainspotting, Anomalisa, I Saw The TV Glow, most Lars Von Trier movies, ones like that.</p> <p>What are the best/ your favorite movies that make you feel like crap in a grounded or relatable way? The last post I saw discussing these kinds of films is about 6 years old, and I wanted to hear what people think nowadays.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;m watching Escape From New York with my 9YO and having to explain the lack of tech, etc. Even though it&#39;s set &quot;in the future&quot; 35 years ago. It reminds me of when I was a kid and watched distopian futuristic movies like Logan&#39;s Run. I loved those movies as a kid and never questioned the tech, the logic or god...the outfits. What are some of those for you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Primaveralillie\"> /u/Primaveralillie </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ht6ei2/futuristic_movies_from_the_past/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ht6ei2/futuristic_movies_from_the_past/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I saw it in my 20s around when it came out and remembered liking it fine, thought it was like a moodier romcom. Couldn\u2019t really recall anything that happened. </p> <p>Then, I just rewatched it the other night, and I\u2019ve since had 2 kids. And it\u2019s such a beautiful story about family and value of time. Full on convulse cried.
