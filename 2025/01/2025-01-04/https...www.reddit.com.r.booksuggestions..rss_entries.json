I don&#39;t know how I had never heard of it before and I began wondering how many other life-hacking systems already exist that I just haven&#39;t been put onto. Maybe We&#39;re too hard on the government. is there some kind of book that gives me little tips and tricks just about living life in general? I&#39;m not just talking about a philosophical book, but a practical one. One that gives advice on managing and building wealth, forming interpersonal relationships, setting yourself up for the future, and the like.

It\u2019s set in the early 1800s and follows an Irish woman who reluctantly pairs up with a bitter Aboriginal Tasmanian guide to track an English soldier who committed crimes against her and get revenge on him. It explores some of the very brutal realities of colonialism (I recommend looking up trigger warnings before you watch it if there are particular things you\u2019re sensitive to) and racism and was just an incredible movie, and I\u2019d love to read something in the same vein set during that period. I\u2019d prefer something with heavy focus on Aboriginal people, but I\u2019m not sure how many books there really are in this period and would be satisfied with anything well-written. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

Among them I\u2019ve read</p> <ol> <li>Atalanta by Jennifer Saint</li> <li>Electra by Jennifer Saint</li> <li>Medusa\u2019s Sisters by Lauren Bear</li> <li>Palace of Eros by Caro De Robertis</li> <li>Daughters of Olympus by Hannah Lynn</li> </ol> <p>I\u2019ve also read Circe by Madeline Miller. The common thread in all of these is that they\u2019re all written by women with the protagonist being either a goddess or female figure. A lot of these also have a sapphic plot point. I have no issues with this but for variety, I\u2019m looking for a novel where the protagonist is a god or hero and for some reason, those are harder to find. I\u2019ve tried Googling and most of the things that pop up are nonfiction texts. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Chain3171",

The art is amazing, and makes me feel something existential. The main character is kinda mysterious, but I love her. The whole book is basically one Big info-dump, but it does it in an amazing Way. The ending feels a little bit abrupt, but I Can tell there is a deeper meaning. Anyway, for anyone who likes a shorter story, I recommend this book. It is beautiful, and an amazing story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Im-gonna-cry1\"> /u/Im-gonna-cry1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ht9yez/i_absolutely_recommend_this_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ht9yez/i_absolutely_recommend_this_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I am in quite possibly the worst reading slump of my life and cannot seem to care about a book for more than a few chapters. I have DNF\u2019d 10 books in the past 6 months and have not finished a single one. </p> <p>I\u2019ve always been a big YA fantasy lover and ventured into the tiktok smut genre a few years ago. More recently, I\u2019ve been interested in mystery but can\u2019t seem to stick to any. Reading has always come to me in waves but I just cannot seem to get to the next peak even after trying out books from all of my favorite genres and some old favorites.</p> <p>I think going back to my roots might help me remember why I love reading so much!! Any YA fantasy recommendations that would bring out the same feelings as reading something like divergent or the hunger games for the first time? Also always open to romance and mystery suggestions if you have one you feel strongly about!<",
