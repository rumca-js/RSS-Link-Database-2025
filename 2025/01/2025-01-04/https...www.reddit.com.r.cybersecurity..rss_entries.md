<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After 2 years of development, we&#39;ve built an AI-powered antivirus in 2025 that incorporates a <strong>VPN</strong>, <strong>Password Manager</strong> and a built in local <strong>LLM Chatbot</strong> in a GGUF File format optimized for CPU-Only Inference including machine learning models for malware detection and <strong>kernel driver</strong> level monitoring for real time protection.</p> <p>After a couple months collecting Hundreds of Millions of Malware samples (totaling 34TBs) for developing a comprehensive Signature Analysis database and using a small fraction to train a powerful machine learning, model using decision trees and random forest models, we&#39;ve managed to create a Deep Learning Trained Model for Malware detection with these performance metrics: </p> <p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: 0.9925 </p> <p><strong>Auc</strong>: 0.9993 </p> <p><strong>Loss</strong>: 0.0215 </p> <p><strong>Precision</strong>: 0.9909 </p> <p><strong>Recall</s

## ITSM & SOAR SOC Ops

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve started a new role as a SOC manager, and our SOC uses both an ITSM and a SOAR platform. I’m currently pushing an initiative to consolidate all ITSM data into our SOAR, as cases can be tracked directly in the SOAR platform. However, this isn’t the first time I’ve encountered this setup. I’ve worked in two other SOCs, and this seems to be a common practice.</p> <p>Why are organizations using ITSM and SOAR simultaneously when SOAR can track cases and provide automation? What’s the purpose of ITSM if there’s a SOAR? Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Powerful_Film_9409"> /u/Powerful_Film_9409 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ht361t/itsm_soar_soc_ops/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ht361t/itsm_soar_soc_ops/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked at Sublime and, using the self-managed Docker images, have found it does a great job at identifying malicious emails missed by M365 Defender XDR. </p> <p>I have had a completely awful time trying to get the AWS Cloudformation template to even work. Sometimes it&#39;s a quota issue (g4dn for example, I started with a quota of 0 and it failed), others it fails to create one component somewhere and then the rollback misses one or more resources. So future installs fail unless I get them all. A lot of work for what is ultimately me trying to project what we&#39;d spend.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t yet tried the ARM template fo see if it works better. </p> <p>In either case, the question for any folks running a self-hosted Sublime Security deployment, what&#39;s your rough monthly/annual spend on it with AWS/Azure?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/766972"> /u/766972 </a> <br/> <span><a href="h
