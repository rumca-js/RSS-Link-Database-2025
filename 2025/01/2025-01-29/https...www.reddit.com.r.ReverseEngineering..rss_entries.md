## Bypass login on app. Company went out of business meaning no new users can access the underwater drone as the servers are offline. Can somebody figure out a bypass hack?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is for an underwater drone that the company that sold them went out of business a few years ago leaving all owners that have purchased since then with no way to register cuz it says Network offline every time you try to log in or register. I am on a few forms on Facebook and here trying to find workarounds and thought maybe somebody could see if they have any ideas cuz I have no idea how to do any of this stuff but really want to use my underwater drone in the local Quarry. If you want to know what it is and what the app looks like you can go on YouTube and search for Power Ray underwater drone. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cdnstudman"> /u/cdnstudman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://powervision.me/en/product/powerray/download">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ich60h/bypass_login_on_app_company_went_out_of_business/">[comments]<
