<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Why isn&#39;t it industry standard to have text/ui scaling options that are easy to find and use? </p> <p>Most games that DO have them are clunky and unintuitive or work poorly. If I can&#39;t read the text in the menu it would be helpful if the text in in-game books/notes also increased. </p> <p>Often the scale only applies to subtitles so menus and ui elements stay miniscule.</p> <p>It&#39;s a problem almost every time I try to start a new game. I didn&#39;t expect to have to get a mod to read text in newer games like bg3.</p> <p>This should be a basic accessibility win for every game developer. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Grodd"> /u/Grodd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1id5h7q/every_game_should_have_easily_adjustable_textui/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1id5h7q/every_game_should_have_easily_adjustable_

My wife is not a hardcore gamer type, and when we do play a game it is usually Mario Kart or Mario Party.</p> <p>Somehow, I convinced her to try Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 with me for a first time playthrough about a month ago, and she LOVES it! We are working our way through Act II, and she just asked me yesterday, whenever we finish BG3, what is coming next?</p> <p>I never imagined in a million years she would enjoy this sort of game, but she loves the rich story and slower paced gameplay. BG3 is obviously a top game of this decade and by having it be her first real game, her bar is now set incredibly high for the next game that we&#39;re going to play together.</p> <p>Our play format has been splitting our party in half. We both play on the living room couch. She plays on her laptop, I play on my HTPC + 75&quot; TV /
