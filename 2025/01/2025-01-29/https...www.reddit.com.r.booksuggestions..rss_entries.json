I recently discovered the &quot;Pink Horror&quot; genre and am obsessed. I also like thrillers, mysteries, WLW romance, memoirs. I&#39;m honestly open to reading pretty much anything, but here are some things that I prefer in books that can make it challenging for me to find a good read: -prefer 1st person perspective - I try to only read books written by women (last year I read almost 50 books and only two were written by a man) - I don&#39;t want smut. A little bit of spice is okay, but I like plot. I&#39;m here for the plot, just tell me a story. </p> <p>Here are some books I have read this year that I really enjoyed: One of Us Knows - Alyssa Cole Sharks don&#39;t Sink - Jasmin Graham When we Were Silent - Fiona McPhillips Bunny - Mona Awad Keep Your Friends Close - Leah Konan Black Sheep - Rachel Harrison </p> <p>I know thats a lot, but any recommendations greatly appreciated! \ud83d\ude03",
