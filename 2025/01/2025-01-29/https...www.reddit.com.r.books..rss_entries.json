I had to reread it, especially after finishing Letter to His Father not long ago I wanted to search for echoes of Kafka himself in Gregor.</p> <p>Gregor was trapped: in his room, in his own mind, in a body that rendered him useless in the eyes of society. He was dismissed the moment he ceased to be functional, yet his love for his family remained intact. In both works, I saw a haunting parallel Kafka describes his father following him around the room to strike him, and then there\u2019s Gregor, scuttling under the furniture as his father chases him in much the same way. </p> <p>When was Gregor ever truly free? As a worker, exploited by his family? Or as an insect, tormented by them?</p> <p>Gregor hid, repulsing his family, and it reminded me so much of depression, how we deal with those suffering from it, seeing only the stinking, decaying body",

I really liked Just Stab Me Now by Jill Bearup (YouTuber), and Apprentice to the Villian by Hannah Nicole Maeher (Tiktok) and Hopeless Necromancer by Shiloh Briar (Instagrammer). Admittedly these creators seemed to the test the waters with the same story in a visual format before making it into book form ie: both Bearup and Maeher had shorts basically telling the story before they made the books with same or similar characters. But was very disappointed in the books by 2 of my favorite podcasters - The Butcher and the Wren by Alaina Urquhart and Anatomy: A Love Story by Dana Schwartz. I felt like the writing was lackluster for both, even though in the podcast medium I enjoy both women&#39;s style of storytelling though vastly different.
