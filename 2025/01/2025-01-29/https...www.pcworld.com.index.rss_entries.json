Typically, these scare tactics are full-screen alerts that mimic antivirus warnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most nefarious examples of scareware is the \u201ctech support scam,\u201d which falsely warn that your device is affected with malware and that you need to call a fake support number or install fake anti-malware software to clean it up and restore things. You may have even seen a few Microsoft IT support scam pop-ups yourself over the years.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"uploadedSrc\":false,\"figureClassNames\":\"wp-block-image size-large\",\"figureStyles\":null,\"imgClassNames\":\"wp-image-2525916\",\"imgStyles\"",
