As corny as it sounds, I&#39;ve learned to love, is a good love story/romantic intrigue peppered in.</p> <p>Kinch and Norrigal in TBtT Jezal and Ardee in TFL etc</p> <p>Are there other good fantasy series that have that Joe A. intense dialog, world and character development as well the hit or miss romances?</p> <p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What was your favorite fantasy video game growing up? The one that lived in your mind and helped shape the way you viewed fantasy?</p> <p>For me, it was Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar. I had gotten Ultima: Exodus with the original Nintendo for Christmas when I was 7. That introduced me to turn-based fantasy. Then, when I got Ultima: Quest of the Avatar, I became immersed in fantasy. That game was so awesome. First off, your character class was based on answers to various ethical scenarios. Then it was completely open-ended. You could do whatever you wanted to do in whatever order (but you had to develop your virtue if you wanted to finish the game). It was just fascinatingly different. Fighters, druids, mages, dungeons… The fantasy seed was planted.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Over the past 2 years I have been bingeing fantasy books, using the top lists in this subs wikis as a reading list. Over this time I have done the complete Stormlight, complete First Law, Jade City trilogy, Schoolomance and then a bunch of individual books here and there.</p> <p>Yes, and also the whole of Court of Thorns and Roses series. So sue me. </p> <p>I am about to dive in to the Gentleman Bastard series before going into Malazan (I was going to dive straight in, but I need a break from VERY EPIC for while). So I think this series fits the bill. I want something fun, sharp and a bit more concise and less sprawling than stormlight and first law.</p> <p>What do others think? Is this the right choice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LordMogroth"> /u/LordMogroth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1icrw8a/is_gentleman_bastards_fun/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo </p> <p>Squares: First in a series, Criminals, Dark Academia (hard mode)</p> <p>What I liked: A very interesting take on magic in a cool modern fashion. The MC is also great, I didnt love her at first but there&#39;s a point where MC decides to let the snake inside her out and there&#39;s a nice bit of catharsis seeing the scared girl peel away and watch her unleash her much tougher resourceful self.</p> <p>What I didnt like: There&#39;s certainly some things that could trigger a person like date rape (although the revenge chapter is definitely a highlight of the book) and child abuse, etc. that made sense for the story but I can see it putting people off. </p> <p>Overall: Great book I&#39;ll be reading the rest of the series once I get through my remaining Squares.</p> <p>Rating: 4.5/5</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redcathal"> /u/redcathal </a> <br/> <span><a href=

(Any semblance of a plot would do)</p> <p>Does this book start to become a little more clear soon, or is the whole thing just one surreal acid trip with not much of a plot/direction?</p> <p>Ps. I know this book is BELOVED, so please don’t take anything I say personally.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface this by saying that unfortunately I did not like Dungeon Crawler Carl. I know DCC is super popular here and super well-liked, but unfortunately it did not vibe with me. At least, I don&#39;t plan on continuing with the series. This is my first LitRPG book, so I came in with no expectations, but unfortunately, it still disappointed. </p> <p>My main issue is the humor. It felt very intrusive and very much trying to break the fourth wall too much. The descriptions especially felt as if they were written not for Carl, but for us. It really broke up the pace of the story, especially when there were periods when it was description after description. That made it tiring to read. </p> <p>A lot of the set-up and story also just felt really arbitrary to me. The entire situation just feels too artificial and I just couldn&#39;t buy into it all, which is usually not too much of an issue for me. How the story played out too felt way too staged as
