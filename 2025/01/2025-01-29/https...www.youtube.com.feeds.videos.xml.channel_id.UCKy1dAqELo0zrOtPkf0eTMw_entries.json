        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nLots of PlayStation news today. February's selection of PS Plus Essentials games have been revealed, headlined by Payday 3. Leadership at Sony is getting a shake-up, with a new Sony CEO announced, and the head of Sony Interactive being confirmed. And finally, for PC gamers who had a real issue signing up for a PlayStation account just to play PlayStation games, Sony is backing off of that a little bit. But PC players who are signed in to a PS account will get special incentives depending on the game they're playing.\n\nAnd our thoughts are with the LA fire victims. Our Humble Bundle charity bundles support @DirectRelief, @WCKitchen, @SavetheChildren, @IMC_Worldwide & @BINCharity, providing medical aid, essential supplies, family support, meals & local business assistance. Help us make a difference during this challenging time. #LAFireRelief #HumbleBundle https://promo.humblebundle.com/lafirerelief",

By swapping out Tony Stark as Peter Parker\u2019s mentor and replacing him with Norman Osborn, we\u2019re treated to 10 episodes of insidiously fun superhero TV. Given how it ends, it\u2019s clear Marvel has a lot of juicy (and unexpected) new ideas they\u2019re eager to explore in the second and third seasons Disney+ has already ordered. This is a truly fresh take on Spider-Man filled with many delightful surprises, from fun superhero cameos to shocking plot twists. The inclusion of real-world issues does give it an air of authenticity, although it\u2019s essentially window dressing for a fun action show with great characters. And while the animation has some distracting quirks, overall, it works quite well. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man has lively pacing, the writing is as sharp as a scorpion\u2019s tail, and it finds new ways to make you laugh and gasp every episod",
