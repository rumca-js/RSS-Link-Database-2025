## Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: performance worthy of the name?

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/5080.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>If Nvidia's RTX 5090 was tricky to review, its 80-class offering is even more challenging. PC users have grown used to this tier of card outperforming the outgoing flagship, but let's be clear - RTX 5080 is a slower card than the RTX 4090 while the new RTX 5090 is much, much faster. In many ways, you can think of the new 5080 as a 4080 Super <em>Super</em>. There's a small but appreciated bump to performance against its predecessor - around 13 percent in my testing - and it's delivered for the same price. And of course, you get the latest DLSS 4 feature set, including multi frame generation, which we'll be looking at in this review. So, this is the best GPU you can buy at its price-point - but it's also the <em>only</em> new GPU available at this price-point.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">Read more</a><

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/WatchDogs2_GoldenGate1.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>In Robert Walser's short fiction book The Walk, a young writer decides to step away from his desk and stroll through the country town he lives in. On the outskirts, where small farms and the occasional factory give way to open countryside, he discovers two children playing in the middle of an empty road. After a moment of admiration, his mood sours when he remembers country roads were made for cars, not kids. "I never shall understand how it can be called a pleasure to hurtle past all the images and objects which our beautiful earth displays, as if one had gone mad and had to accelerate for fear of despair," he thinks.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/taking-a-virtual-hike-the-slow-eerie-pleasure-of-youtubes-video-game-walking-tours">Read more</a></p>
