## OpenStreetMap Community Discussion on How to Handle the U.S. Federal Government’s Imminent Designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘Gulf of America’

<p>Fascinating thread — and an almost entirely civil discussion of what has become, for obvious reasons, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/28/google-maps-gulf">an inflammatory topic</a>. These are mapping and metadata nerds approaching the dilemma in the very nerdiest of ways. I found it rather soothing, and also quite informative — particularly the posts from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Minh%20Nguyen">Minh Nguyễn</a>, who seems to be an OpenStreetMap super user. <a href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/t/gulf-of-america-gulf-of-mexico/124571/55">First</a>:</p>

<p>David Pierce, writing at The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24352968/pebble-smartwatch-open-source-google-comeback">The Pebble Smartwatch Is Making a Comeback</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than buy another smartwatch, Migicovsky decided to try and
get Pebble going again. He <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging">sold his most recent startup</a>, a
messaging app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998294/beeper-imessage-apple-app-security">called Beeper</a>, to Automattic last year and
left the company in the fall. Since then, he’d thought about
starting a Pebble-like product from scratch, figuring it’d be
easier to do the same thing again a second time. “But then I was
like, <em>what if I just asked Google to open-source the operating
system</em>?” he says. It felt like a long shot, but he knew the code
was just sitting dormant inside Mountain View somewhere. So he
asked. A few times.</p>



## ★ My Spitball Theory on TikTok’s Current Semi-Reprieve in the U.S.

<p>Here’s an addendum to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/27/shakeup-app-store-downloads">my post yesterday</a> on the recent shake-up atop the generally stable “top free downloads” list in the App Store. Some of the shake-up is from new entrants, like the much-ballyhooed AI chatbot DeepSeek. But a lot of it is the direct result of the sudden absence of ByteDance’s entire lineup of apps: TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap. Alternatives are vying to fill those voids.</p>

<p>TikTok returning to operational service in the U.S. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/briktok">after an outage of just one day</a> has squelched the outrage surrounding its ban. The app stopped working; TikTok users, unprepared for its ban, freaked out; the app started working again the next day; and TikTok fans more or less went back to scrolling their feeds and shut up. Controversy over.</p>

<p>But the controversy shouldn’t be over. And unless something changes, it’s going to sl

## Google Maps Will Rename Gulf of Mexico to ‘Gulf of America’, for American Users Only

<p>Google, in an announcement on X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We
have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they
have been updated in official government sources.</p>

<p>For geographic features in the U.S., this is when <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis">Geographic
Names Information
System</a>
(GNIS) is updated. When that happens, we will update Google Maps
in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America.</p>

<p>Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between
countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in
the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.</p>
