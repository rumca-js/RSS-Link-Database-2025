I checked all the rules and it didn&#39;t make any sense - sometimes it was blocked and sometimes allowed.</p> <p>I figured that since DeepSeek is a new-ish application, NetSkope categorization is not optimized yet - i

From what I’ve read on this subreddit, getting a job in cybersecurity can be tough without experience (start in a help desk role/IT), and this seems like a great way to gain hands-on skills and training. Major downside being a 6-year commitment, but it seems somewhat flexible, where I could still maintain my normal life and pursue something in the private sector.</p> <p>For the record, I have no experience in anything IT-related. Outside of a Google Cybersecurity Cert and practicing for SEC+, I have no knowledge of anything else in the industry.</p> <p>Has anyone you know gone this route?

While they offer robust protection, WAFs are not infallible. Attackers are constantly innovating, devising new techniques to circumvent these security measures. One such technique, often overlooked, is the exploitation of shell globbing — a powerful feature inherent in Unix-like operating systems. This blog post delves into the intricacies of shell globbing, demonstrating how it can be strategically employed to evade WAFs and execute OS command injection attacks. We’ll also explore the limitations of this approach, discuss essential mitigation strategies for robust web application security, and examine real-world examples, including specific WAF evasion scenarios.</p> <p>As highlighted by t
