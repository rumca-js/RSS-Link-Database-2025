It's Netflix for games; who doesn't want that? It's great because it's try before you buy... one thing after another thing. Really the barrier for people to play games is just access to those games.

Like last year's event, Lunar Awakening replaces all of the game's shrines with special Lunar Shrines. These shrines function much the same as their normal counterparts, only with even more powerful effects in addition to their usual ones. Lunar Artillery Shrines, for example, have a chance to blast enemies with a holy bomb in addition to piercing enemies with holy arrows as usual. Whereas Greed shrines typically just grant players more gold for killing monsters, the Lunar Greed Shrine actually makes it so every kill also has a chance to summon a Treasure Goblin.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"ht",
