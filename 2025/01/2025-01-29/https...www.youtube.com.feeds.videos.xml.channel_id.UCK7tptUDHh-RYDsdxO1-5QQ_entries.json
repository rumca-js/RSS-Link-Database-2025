        "description": "President Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship has kicked off an unprecedented legal battle over immigration policy. Most legal scholars say the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear\u2013that people born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. But the Trump administration\u2019s legal case is built around the idea that children born to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be excluded from birthright citizenship.  \n\nWSJ explains how this fight will play out in courts and its broader implications.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Trump\u2019s executive order\n0:30 Birthright citizenship, explained\n2:28 Consequences of ending birthright citizenship \n3:49 The legal process \n\nNews Explainers\nSome days the high-speed news cycle can bring more questions than answers.
