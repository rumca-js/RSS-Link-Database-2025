President Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship has kicked off an unprecedented legal battle over immigration policy. Most legal scholars say the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear–that people born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. But the Trump administration’s legal case is built around the idea that children born to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be excluded from birthright citizenship.  

WSJ explains how this fight will play out in courts and its broader implications.
