Hs death causes her to lose her baby and after she finds out who outed her husband to the cops, she poses as a babysitter to the woman who&#39;s given birth and needs a nanny. DeMornay&#39;s Icy Blonde look and cold expressions switching from a sunshine smile to a menacing foul-mouthed threat, she&#39;s just perfect in this movie. </p> <p>I am disappointed she never got a part as good as this one. I saw her in Feds, unrecognizable in Runaway Train, moving in Testament, a brief but warm presence in The Trip to Bountiful, she was my favorite version of Milady De Winter in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (I haven&#39;t seen Eva Green&#39;s take, though). </p> <p>She was also the original choice for T

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just want to put this out there, because I haven’t seen it discussed anywhere and want to see what people think. Benji represents David’s repressed pain in this movie. Literally, his pain made real. It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, so I can’t remember every detail but I’m going to do my best to make my case. </p> <p>When they were younger, David was a boy would cry at everything, and the two characters were constantly together, but as David grew older, he left his pain (Benji) behind in order to create a life for himself. David never goes to visit his cousin, and although he’s open to short visits from Benji in NYC, it is one thing to allow yourself to feel bits and pieces of your trauma as though it’s a visitor in your home, it isnt the same as fully engaging with it on its own terms. When their grandmother dies, David arrives at the airport and finds his cousin waiting for him. They go to Poland and, as David sees the horrors that his people

All I can really say, is that I didn&#39;t know what I expected, but if there were any kind of expectations, they were blown out of the water. It was more psychedelic than I expected but I was all here for it. I thought it was fantastic and I threw it in my top 4 on letterboxd for now. Should I watch the redux cut at some point?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello I&#39;m pretty stressed lately and I&#39;m looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It&#39;s okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funny—but I&#39;m looking for something with almost no tension.</p> <p>Most movies, even really calm ones like howl&#39;s moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i&#39;m looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension acts—and it&#39;s still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i&#39;d say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I&#39;ve watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD) If you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something I realized fairly recently. It&#39;s well known that streaming has the massive downside of making you dependent on a remote server instead of having a physical object to own, meaning you &quot;buy&quot; something that can be taken away at any point. But a similarly bad issue in my opinion is that, with the slow death of home releases, we lose the &quot;bonus features&quot;. Director/cast commentary, deleted scenes, making-ofs. Sure, a lot of people probably don&#39;t care about it, but a lot probably also do.</p> <p>Personally, for me the production-story is sometimes more interesting than rewatching a movie, to the point that I, at one point, spent an absurd amount on a big <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/p44AAOSwlqtnZJIR/s-l1600.webp">Harry Potter Box Set</a> because it came with literal hours of making-off and similar content. And I&#39;m kinda sad that that era is (soon) over, with something like commentaries just about gone and

## What makes some actors look "period" or "modern"?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The other day I read someone saying that Ben Affleck has &quot;a face that knows about emails&quot;, which I though was hilariously apt. He was excellent in The Last Duel, but I definitely feel his look doesn&#39;t lend to roles in period films. </p> <p>On the other end of the spectrum, actors like Tobias Menzies and Mark Rylance seem to blend into period settings more than contemporary ones. </p> <p>This makes me wonder, what makes some actors look more &quot;period&quot; than others? I think super neat dental veneers and plastic surgeries play a role here (for example, Nicole Kidman in The Northman looked distinctly modern), but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the full answer.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>in the world of movies, there is no bigger name in special effects then ray harryhausen. despite stop motion not being used as much nowadays, his films continue to astound and entertain. i am a big fan of his work and it was actually his work that partially inspired my love of film.</p> <p>harryhausen made 16 feature films over the course of his career, not counting short films. however, it&#39;s not for lack of trying on his part. harryhausen had numerous ideas for films that never ended up materializing. there&#39;s even a whole book about them called harryhausen the lost movies.</p> <p>considering how many filmmakers have been influenced by harryhausen&#39;s work, it&#39;s only a matter of time before someone tries to make one of these projects that harryhausen planned. if that happens, they should go all the way with the tribute and use stop motion animation instead of CGI animation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="http

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Famous romantic movie of course, the music, the pottery, etc. That early scene with Unchained Melody is one of the most romantic sequences ever filmed. </p> <p>And it’s also not novel to highlight Whoopi, who won the Oscar here. </p> <p>But upon rewatch, it really is an impressive performance. Whoopi is absolutely electric in this movie. She bursts in like lightning and so smoothly carries the tone from comedy to drama and back again and she pulls that off effortlessly even in individual scenes. She doesn’t even show up in the movie at all till 40 minutes in. </p> <p>It’s a brilliant performance and again she won the Oscar so it’s not underrated or anything, but I think it’s often viewed as a sort of silly performance or even a Magical Negro (ess) one, but it isn’t anything like that. She’s just so warm and just so alive, it’s wonderful to rewatch after so long. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/T
