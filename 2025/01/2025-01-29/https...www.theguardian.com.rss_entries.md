<p>I can give women life-saving medications and resuscitate babies, yet we are still the lowest paid of our profession in the country</p><p>It’s the start of my shift as a midwife in a New South Wales hospital. I feel like I am doing a lot for my $45 per hour. I am caring for a woman in the throes of labour. Her eyes are glassy, her vocalisations frantic. She is in transition, a time in labour you can feel terrified and out of control. I hold her and ground her with my well-practised voice, refined from more than 10 years of experience.</p><p>I set up a baby Resuscitaire in case it is needed. I document heart rates and clean up body fluids while also educating a student working with me. We write down vital signs and draw up drugs ready to administer. Do you know that midwives can initiate dosages of morphine, antibiotics and other drugs without having to bother a doctor?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/30/i-am-a-midwife-in-a-nsw-hospital-this-is-what-a

<ul><li>WSL champions in talks with England midfielder</li><li>Chloe Kelly hits out at lack of future at Manchester City</li></ul><p>Chelsea are hoping to pull off a sensational deadline-day move to sign the England midfielder Keira Walsh from Barcelona, the Guardian understands, as the Women’s Super League transfer window approaches a dramatic conclusion.<br><br>
 The WSL champions and current leaders have held advanced negotiations with the European champions over a fee for Walsh, who previously set a world record for the most expensive transfer in the women’s game when she joined Barcelona from Manchester City in 2022.</p><p>Walsh has helped Barcelona win back-to-back Champions League titles in the past two seasons but her contract is set to expire in the summer. The 27-year-old was targeted by Arsenal last summer and was reportedly the subject of a bid from the north Londoners, who have been heavily linked with Walsh for several months.<br><br>

<p>Aston Villa made life difficult for themselves but at the final whistle they could finally celebrate advancing automatically to the last 16 of the Champions League. Celtic stunned Villa after recovering from an early two-goal deficit to level but Ollie Watkins registered his first goal in the competition to nudge Villa in front and then missed a penalty to put the game to bed. Judging by the way Watkins celebrated his strike, he is here to stay. A smirking Watkins coolly jogged along the Holte End before clenching his fist and appearing to tap the crest on his chest. Meanwhile Jhon Durán, an unused substitute, seems destined to depart for the Saudi Pro League.</p><p>Before kick-off a giant tifo of Ozzy Osbourne, the celebrity Villa fan, filled the face of the Holte End but 15 minutes earlier, at the end of Villa’s warmup, it was Faithless’s Insomnia which blared over the speakers.

<p>Liverpool lost their 100% record in the Champions League but you suspect Arne Slot will be over the disappointment before the team’s flight lands back on Merseyside. PSV Eindhoven secured the victory they needed to guarantee a playoff place with a rousing comeback against a youthful Liverpool side, who had debutant Amara Nallo sent off four minutes after his introduction.</p><p>Nallo’s misfortune – the 18-year-old defender looked distraught after receiving a straight red for denying Johan Bakayoko a clear goalscoring opportunity – tainted an encouraging display from Liverpool’s youngsters. But Slot’s side retained top spot in the table regardless of defeat. And, as the Liverpool head coach admitted beforehand, the final placing hardly matters when his team are guaranteed to face the 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th placed side in the last 16.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/29/psv-eindhoven-liverpool-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

With four minutes left in Arsenal’s last Champions League match of a highly successful group stage, Ethan Nwaneri began his walk around the pitch at Montilivi.

<p>You can tell how corrupt our recent politicians have been by how attractive Harriet Walter’s portrayal of the ex-PM seems alongside Steve Coogan in this drama based on a scorching TV interview</p><p>Brian and Maggie is a two-parter billed as a docuseries by its creators that traces the relationship between former Labour MP turned journalist Brian Walden (Steve Coogan) and Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher (Harriet Walter) and its abrupt ending, brought about by his uncustomarily scorching interview with her after chancellor Nigel Lawson’s shock resignation in 1989.</p><p>Written by Sherwood’s James Graham, it is directed by Stephen Frears and boasts a cast full of notables fit to stand alongside Coogan and Walter. Yet it is an odd beast, perhaps because it is trying to do so much. It is partly an examination of the importance of the long-form political interview, for which Walden was famous, in a democratic society, and a lament for a bygone age when the argument for i
