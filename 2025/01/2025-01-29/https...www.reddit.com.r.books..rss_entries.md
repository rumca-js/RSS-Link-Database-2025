<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A cup of hot tea, my comfiest pajamas, and a quiet sense of contentment as I revisit The Metamorphosis by Kafka. I had to reread it, especially after finishing Letter to His Father not long ago I wanted to search for echoes of Kafka himself in Gregor.</p> <p>Gregor was trapped: in his room, in his own mind, in a body that rendered him useless in the eyes of society. He was dismissed the moment he ceased to be functional, yet his love for his family remained intact. In both works, I saw a haunting parallel Kafka describes his father following him around the room to strike him, and then there’s Gregor, scuttling under the furniture as his father chases him in much the same way. </p> <p>When was Gregor ever truly free? As a worker, exploited by his family? Or as an insect, tormented by them?</p> <p>Gregor hid, repulsing his family, and it reminded me so much of depression, how we deal with those suffering from it, seeing only the stinking, decaying body

## M. Scott Peck and the road he really traveled

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read Peck&#39;s <em>The Road Less Traveled</em> in college and it had a huge impact, especially on how I understood my spiritual life and its connection to psychological growth. I know many people who had the same experience, who were strongly influenced for the better by <em>Road</em>. </p> <p>I read Peck&#39;s later books also. These went down some strange roads, speaking of roads, including Satanic possession and exorcisms, but at the time I was so impressed by the real wisdom of <em>Road</em> that I wasn&#39;t as critical as I should have been.</p> <p>Recently I came across this: <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/gin-cigarettes-women-im-a-prophet-not-a-saint-jqtfvbcxk6g">Gin, cigarettes, women: I’m a prophet, not a saint</a>, a 2005 interview with Peck. (He died later that same year.) The article reveals Peck to be a grandiose, narcissistic, hard-drinking, chain-smoking jackass who shouldn&#39;t be near anyone&#39;s spiritual life. His

## Coming of age story vs character development?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need help settling an argument which I am now less confident on. Is there a difference between a coming of age story vs a story which is primarily focused on character development? </p> <p>A friend is calling Lessons in Chemistry a coming of age story (specifically about the mother&#39;s character development) because he says that the woman learns to understand herself and her place in the world better. With this vague definition, I would say that could also apply to, say, Funny Story (in which the 33yo female lead learns to recognize and deal with her trust issues and longing for a home and family and to establish herself as her own independent person) or Love, Theoretically (in which the late 20s female lead learns to stop being a people pleaser and to establish herself as her own independent person). Obviously both those two books are romance novels, but if you removed the romance element, would they be coming of age stories? Or would they just

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have found that a few of my favorite content creators have written books and the results in my opinion have been hit or miss. I really liked Just Stab Me Now by Jill Bearup (YouTuber), and Apprentice to the Villian by Hannah Nicole Maeher (Tiktok) and Hopeless Necromancer by Shiloh Briar (Instagrammer). Admittedly these creators seemed to the test the waters with the same story in a visual format before making it into book form ie: both Bearup and Maeher had shorts basically telling the story before they made the books with same or similar characters. But was very disappointed in the books by 2 of my favorite podcasters - The Butcher and the Wren by Alaina Urquhart and Anatomy: A Love Story by Dana Schwartz. I felt like the writing was lackluster for both, even though in the podcast medium I enjoy both women&#39;s style of storytelling though vastly different. Though in their defense they were both original stories. I realize that being a good s
