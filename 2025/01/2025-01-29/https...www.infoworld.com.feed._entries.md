<p>Rust’s leadership team announced progress on the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3487254/rust-team-announces-2024-development-goals.html">26 Rust project goals for 2024</a>. Leadership representatives said the project emphasized work on asynchronous closures and finalizing its Rust development goals for early 2025.</p>



<p>Async closures, cited as a <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/goals.html#flagship-goals">flagship goal</a> for Rust, reached stability in December, said Rust proponents. The <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/01/23/Project-Goals-Dec-Update.html">December project goals update</a> was posted on January 23. Rust 1.85, due February 2

<p>Docker images can get pretty bulky if you’re not careful. Your typical Docker image includes everything you need to run a particular piece of software (such as the application language’s runtime) <em>and</em> everything those things depend on. Images in the hundreds of megabytes are common, often because they use as their base some variety of Linux distribution. Anything beyond a static binary will have dependencies that need to be included in a container image.</p>



<p>So how small <em>can</em> you make a base Docker image? Pretty small, as it turns out—within the realm of a few dozen megabytes, or even smaller. The quest for slim-and-trim base Docker images has led to the creation of some a

<p>Any substantial website is going to need to customize itself for individual users. Thus, it is going to have to authenticate those users — that is, let them log in. As a software developer, it is your job to make the whole process as smooth and secure as possible.</p>



<p>Of course, doing this creates all sorts of issues and problems. Sure, you have to protect your users’ data, somehow get the user to create good passwords, assume that they’ll forget their passwords, and assume that they’ll probably not be secure in general.</p>



<p>Like encryption, authentication is one of those things that you are tempted to “roll your own” but absolutely should not. The industry has progressed enough tha

<p>One of the coolest things about being a software developer is that you often know what’s behind the curtain. To some extent, at least. Working in tech gives you the chance to know first-hand what a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2336165/the-most-popular-neural-network-styles-and-how-they-work.html">neural network</a> is, or what makes <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3574488/what-is-quantum-computing-solutions-to-impossible-problems.html">quantum computing</a> so significant, or how the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2270982/a-quick-guide-to-modern-cryptography.html">cryptography</a> in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3653379/a-quick-guide-to-blockch

<p>Everyone wants to get their hands on AI tools, and employees in government agencies are no exception. Still, stakes are far higher for governments when it comes to security, privacy, and protecting the public.</p>



<p>As a means of overcoming these challenges, OpenAI has rolled out ChatGPT Gov, a version of its flagship frontier model specifically tailored to US government agencies. The platform has many of the same capabilities as OpenAI’s other enterprise products, including access to GPT-4o and the ability to build custom GPTs — and it also features a much higher level of security than ChatGPT Enterprise.</p>



<p>The launch comes after a busy week for OpenAI (and the industry in general)

<p>Startup times for Java applications would be improved through a proposed API for stable values, which are objects that hold immutable data.</p>



<p>An<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/502"> OpenJDK Java Enhancement Proposal (JEP)</a> for a preview of stable values notes that stable values are treated as constants by the JVM, enabling the same performance optimizations that are enabled by declaring a field <code>final</code>. Compared to <code>final</code><strong> </strong>fields, however, stable values provide greater flexibility as to the timing of initialization. Thus Java application startup would be improved by breaking up the monolithic initialization of application state. </p>
