I am buying blade and sorcery however I&#39;m not sure what copy to get. Are they the same game? Quest version is called &quot;blade and sorcery: nomad&quot; while the steam version is just called &quot;blade and sorcery&quot;. I&#39;d rather own it on steam because my PC runs games better than my quest 2. Are both titles the same game? Are they crossplay? If my buddy&#39;s get it on their quest and I own it on steam can we play togeather?

The interactivity in these games is fascinating to me. I own a PS5 but no gaming PC. From what I have researched, it sounds like the PSVR2 is straight up better for gaming with the graphics, colors and some exclusives. </p> <p>But the mixed reality features on the Meta Quest interests me. Google Earth VR and watching 3D movies sounds really cool to me. My main focus is on gaming and I know the Meta has some really fun exclusives like Batman. So I wonder if the extra mixed reality features would be worth it or if it would feel gimmicky and something I wouldn’t use often over gaming. </p> <p>I might get a gaming PC next year (mostly to play Half Life Alyx) so I know that would open more games to me as well.
