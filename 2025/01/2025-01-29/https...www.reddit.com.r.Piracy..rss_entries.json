I am not intelligent and know nothing about command prompts, coding etc. </p> <p>Basically the title. I have a couple of Firefox add ons that are verified and dedicated to optimizing HLS downloads. I used VLC media player for the files and they play but they have skips every few seconds that are not crazy bad but happen often enough to amount to the equivalent of Chinese water torture. </p> <p>Any tips? </p> <p>Mega thread checked btw.

If I missed the answer I\u2019m looking for, feel free to make me look dumb in the comments by telling me exactly where it is. </p> <p>Edit: I\u2019m not talking about streaming the HLS files from the site, I\u2019m talking about playing already downloaded HLS movie files which I\u2019ve put onto a personal SSD.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ScaredTomatillo5108\"> /u/",

The issue that I am having is that whenever I attempt to install the sound library, the download bar goes over the limit and a window pops up saying &quot;The Download of Essential sounds and settings failed&quot;. How can I get it to install the sound library? Any help is greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/klutch2008\"> /u/klutch2008 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1icgn9x/issue_installing_sound_library_with_tnt_crack_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1icgn9x/issue_installing_sound_library_with_tnt_crack_of/\">[comments]</a></span>",
