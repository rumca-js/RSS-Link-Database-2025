<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m trying to remember a game I remember playing about 20 years ago.</p> <p>Unless I&#39;m mixing up things from multiple games, it was a 2D, top-down game, were you controlled some vehicle that behaved somewhat like in the game &quot;snake&quot;. The levels were fairly elaborate and there were little ramps and bridges to go from one part to another.</p> <p>I think there were bonuses and perhaps weapons? Unfortunately I can&#39;t remember exactly what the game mechanic was, and if it was more like a puzzle or an action game. Perhaps it was about conquering different parts of the level, or doing certain things in a certain order? I&#39;m not sure.</p> <p>The art style was pretty nice, it had a cartoonish sci-fi theme. Maybe a bit of a polished japanese arcade vibe?</p> <p>It contained roughly 100 levels. I&#39;m pretty sure I played it on Linux and that it was open source, but I went through libregamewiki and couldn&#39;t recognize it.</p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, need quick help on getting Far Cry 1 to work on Lutris. I tried almost everything really and nothing seems to work. I initally did the usual steps of just installing the setup without altering much, but the game would crash. The first thing I did is installing it with DirectX9b to install within the setup wizard. The game would just crash and not start. I tried without checking the DirextX9b, same result. Tried under different versions of Windows in the installation process to no avail. The reason why I&#39;m trying to get it to work under Lutris is because the only way I know rn is via PlayOnLinux, which is outdated and has terrible performance in comparison to the games I got working under Lutris. As for the crash log, I get this error but I have no idea what it means:</p> <p>gamemodeauto: dlopen failed - libgamemode.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</p> <p>I&#39;d be happy if I can get the game working in
