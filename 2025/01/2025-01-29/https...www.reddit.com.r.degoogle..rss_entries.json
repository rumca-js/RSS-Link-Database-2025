Unfortunately, my work uses google workspace for everything. I still need to access information from my personal phone (iphone), especially my calendar. I have tried to add the work google calendar as a subscription to the iphone calendar but keep getting a validation failed message. I do not want to be logged into google anywhere on my phone, which is the solution I keep seeing. Any suggestions? I know I can log in via a browser, but it is so clunky, and it logs me out automatically every 12 hours.
