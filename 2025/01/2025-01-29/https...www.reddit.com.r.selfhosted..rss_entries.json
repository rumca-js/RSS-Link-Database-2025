So I live in an area where putting a server at my house is not an option- aka our internet just doesn&#39;t support it. Got me thinking that maybe there may be other people who may be in a similar situation.</p> <p>By ourselves, renting rackspace in a colocation center is out of the price range, BUT I was thinking about starting a business where I offer rack space JUST for homelab users (or small buisnesses) who don&#39;t have a better place for their server. The city I live near has a fiber hotel with space available - the math works out in such a way that depending on how many &quot;clients&quot; were interested, I could offer power, space and un-metered 1/1 or 10/10gpbs fiber for like....150-200$ per Rack unit.</p> <p>Thoughts? If a service like this existed would you buy in?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/oragamisquirrell\"> /u/oragamisqui",
