I started down this path some months ago:</p> <p>Attempt #1: using Cursor, I was able to make a web app that handled RSS aggregation and filtering. But it was just an offline client that relied on the rss2json API and saved settings into the browser cache. I tried incorporating a Google Gemini API to filter the aggregated feed, but it didn&#39;t seem effective.</p> <p>Attempt #2: subscribed to Replit. Very impressed that I could build and deploy a nice looking basic RSS reader application within an hour or two, using rss-parser at server level. But as I added features, the agent introduced bugs ",
