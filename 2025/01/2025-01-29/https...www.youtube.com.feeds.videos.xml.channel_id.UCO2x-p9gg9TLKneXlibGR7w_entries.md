This video breaks down *exactly* what NPUs are, how they work, what they’re going to enable in the tech we use every day, and most importantly—why *you* should even care. Spoiler alert: NPUs are certain to be a *big* deal revolutionizing AI, machine learning, and computing efficiency, even though they aren’t *really* all that different than chips we’ve been using for decades. We’ll break down how NPUs differ from CPUs and GPUs, why they’re essential for handling AI workloads, and how they enable real-time machine learning applications with incredible power efficiency—not
