I still don’t get it.” So he turned her down. And when Dexys laid down Come on Eileen with Langer behind the mixing desk, he didn’t think it would be a hit. “I was completely wrong. I never had the faith.”</p><p>It duly reached No 1 and became the biggest-selling single of 1982, just one of the many triumphs Langer had with production partner Alan Winstanley.

<p>Palme d’Or-winning Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s tale of four sisters is a stunningly shot, laugh-out-loud tale that’s hugely touching. How has it gone almost unnoticed?</p><p>Trust Netflix to make absolutely no fuss whatsoever about Asura, which could be the best drama it has put out in years. The lack of fanfare for the series, quietly released in early January, is genuinely baffling. It comes from the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who previously made the gorgeous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/17/the-makanai-cooking-for-the-maiko-house-netflix-the-joyful-japanese-food-and-friendship-drama-you-should-never-watch-hungry">The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House</a> for the streamer and was nominated for an Oscar for his majestic 2018 film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/21/shoplifters-review-hirokazu-kore-eda">Shoplifters</a>, which also won the Palme d’Or.

Ask someone who knows about these things how to fix the zip on your coat, and they’ll pull a licked lemon of a face. Gravely, a head will be shaken. Very difficult, if not impossible.

I was at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 flying somewhere to cover a Champions League football match for ITV. Making my way to the gate, which was showing last call, I realised I hadn’t brought a coat.

But it’s always on, always consuming energy.</p><p>It doesn’t have to be like this – your freezer is an amazing kitchen tool; the long-stay car park of your fridge. Because the freezer has been around for so long, we forget how versatile it can be. “If the freezer had never been developed and it came out like the air fryer did, people would be like, ‘God, this is amazing!’” says Suzanne Mulholland, the bestselling author and batch-cooking expert better known as <a href="https://thebatchlady.com/">The Batch Lady</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/29/freeze-your-nuts-not-yo

<p>Signed off with depression, I began gardening. Being able to grow my own food brought me hope and a career change</p><p>In 2012, I had taken to hiding and sobbing in a meeting room at the London advertising agency I worked for. I held a senior position at the company and, if I had been found, it would have been deeply embarrassing. But most days, I woke up feeling as if a lead weight was pressing on my chest; I would spend my commute overwhelmed by an inexplicable feeling of sorrow. Every ringing phone in the office felt like an electric shock. Hiding in the barely used meeting room, hoping for respite had become a regular occurrence.</p><p>But respite didn’t come. Despite my picture-perfect life – high-flying career, happy home and good health – my mind unravelled. I was signed off work with depression and, initially, spent weeks curled beneath the duvet with the curtains drawn, unable to face life, and consumed by shame. The good fortune of understanding bosses and private healt

<p>It’s been like this for most of  our 10 years together. I’m getting a little frustrated</p><p><strong>My partner has little interest in foreplay and wants to move quickly to the main event. This nearly always consists of standard straight vanilla sex: penetrative, usually missionary. She reaches orgasm very rapidly – nearly always before I’m anywhere close – after which she immediately loses all interest. She does manually bring me to climax</strong><strong>, but I don’t feel close to her at that moment. Then she gets on with her day, or goes to sleep.</strong></p><p><strong>We have been together 10 years and this pattern dates back to early in our relationship. I am increasingly frustrated: while we have sex relatively often and the early stages are pleasurable, I almost never have a really good orgasm. This is having an effect on our relationship more generally. We have talked about it a lot (my partner would say too much), but she can’t seem to see the problem.</strong><br><br>

<p>Is screen use really sapping our ability to focus and lowering our IQs? The scientists who have actually analysed the data give their verdict</p><p>Andrew Przybylski, a professor of human behaviour and technology at Oxford University, is a busy man. It’s only midday and already he has attended meetings on “Skype, Teams, in person and now FaceTime audio”. He appears to be switching seamlessly between these platforms, showing no signs of mental impairment. “The erosion of my brain is a function of time and small children,” he says. “I do not believe there’s a force in technology that is more deleterious than the beauty of life.”</p><p>Przybylski should know: he studies technology’s effects on cognition and wellbeing.
