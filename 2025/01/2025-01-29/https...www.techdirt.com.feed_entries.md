Well, we can go ahead and erase &#8220;perhaps&#8221; from this not-all-that-prescient-actually-given-the-circumstances headline: DOJ Issues Perhaps The Last Law Enforcement Investigation Report We’ll See For The Next Four Years It was inevitable. Trump&#8217;s DOJ kicked the Civil Rights Division to the curb faster than Trump cycled through Attorneys General during his first term. Trump promised the [&#8230;]

As a result we’ve seen an endless number of scandals where companies use LLMs to create entirely [&#8230;]

After years of Meta insisting its content moderation was essential for platform health, Zuckerberg&#8217;s sudden embrace of fake &#8220;free speech&#8221; is having exactly the consequences anyone paying attention would expect. Just as advertisers fled ExTwitter when Musk decided &#8220;brand safety&#8221; was for wimps, Meta&#8217;s advertisers are getting nervous about their own brands being associated with [&#8230;]

It&#8217;s amazing how many things just don&#8217;t look bad until, you know, you actually look at them. I mean, we&#8217;ve always known civil asset forfeiture programs are hot garbage, but the government at large was never really interested in this take. Some officials and legislators may have had their suspicions, but the easiest way for [&#8230;]

The 2021 infrastructure bill earmarked $42.5 billion in broadband subsidies that will be coming to the states starting this year.

Ah, Steve King. Not the famed author of horror fiction, of course. I&#8217;m talking about the former representative from Iowa who authored all kinds of political horror, instead.
