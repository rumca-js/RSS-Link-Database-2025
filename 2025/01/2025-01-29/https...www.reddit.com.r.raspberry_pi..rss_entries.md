<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All</p> <p>I have a raspberry pi running remotely that for over a year has been logging data received over a USB serial port. Node-red takes this data and passes it to a database.</p> <p>All of a sudden this has stopped working....</p> <p>Nothing has really changed recently... Except I had an issue where I was getting errors to do with a disk being full... The disk wasn&#39;t really full, the network location that the pi was trying to write logs to has been turned off so that broke a load of stuff. I&#39;ve now removed references to that network location and removed the mount details.</p> <p>I can&#39;t understand why this device has suddenly gone after working for so long. As I said I am remote so don&#39;t have physical access to it but I can get people to go and prod it. Someone has already gone to make sure that the usb cable is still plugged in.</p> <p>Any help very much appreciated.</p> <p>In the node red logs I see:</p> <blockquote> <p>[err

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to set my zero in otg with a different power than the pi it&#39;s plugged in. So I&#39;ve made a custom wire that only sends data (green, white and black) and and gets the VCC (red) from another source. I&#39;ve connected all 3 grounds together (source data, source power and the output data+power) but it can&#39;t detect it. Everything works fine when I use both ports instead of just the otg one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oodelay"> /u/oodelay </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1icjzq4/pi_zero_otg_power_question_regarding_gnd_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1icjzq4/pi_zero_otg_power_question_regarding_gnd_from/">[comments]</a></span>
