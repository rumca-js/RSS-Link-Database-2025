<p>Streamers love to fiddle with their navigation menus, moving this menu bar here and shifting this button there, all in the name of “streamlining” the experience. The changes are typically just different, not better, but Max’s latest menu revamp at least adds something new. </p>



<p>The most obvious <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/new-max-navigation-menu-launches-today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change on the new Max navigation</a> is that the top menu bar, which housed such items as Home, Series, Movies, HBO, B-R Sports, and News, has been nixed. </p>



<p>Those top “content lenses” have now shifted over to the left-side menu, meaning you’ll no longer have to jump from one side of the screen to the other when navigating the various menu items. </p>



<p>Sounds logical—although <a href="https://thestreamable.com/netflix-t

<p>Bringing together Windows and the Apple iPhone has been an agonizing journey. Microsoft is taking another step to connect the two, providing a consistent UI and file sharing between the two platforms via the Start menu.</p>



<p>Microsoft already includes an app called Phone Link within Windows, which is a surprisingly powerful way to connect Windows with Android phones. But Apple’s reluctance to open its platform has meant that iPhone owners don’t enjoy the same benefits. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1929086/how-to-use-imessage-on-windows-11.html">Connecting Windows’ Phone Link to Apple’s iMessage</a>, for example, requires some fiddling and caveats. </p>

<p>SSDs, i.e. solid state drives, have completely changed the computing experience over the last decade. </p>



<p>These wondrous storage devices have sped up previously ponderous boot times to a point bordering instantaneous, vastly improved the responsiveness of programs and games, and generally made the copious long wait times we all used to suffer a thing of a past. If you’re not using an SSD, you should be, and if you have an older model, consider upgrading to the faster speeds offered by newer models powered by cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 interfaces.</p>



<p>That said, a premium drive may not deliver any more real world performance than a bargain drive. Mainstream software, including Windows has yet to implement the many performance tricks, such as multiple queues that NVMe SSDs offer. </p>

<p>Some big changes are coming with the latest season of Major League Soccer on Apple TV, including a new production studio and a featured Sunday night soccer match each week. </p>



<p>One thing that isn’t changing for Apple’s MLS Season Pass in 2025 is the price, although there will be some special offers for Comcast’s Xfinity, DirecTV, and T-Mobile subscribers. </p>



<p>The latest MLS season is set to get underway on February 22, with select preseason matches being streamed via MLS Season Pass starting February 11. </p>

<p>Right now, there’s no other RPG that’s more hotly anticipated than the upcoming <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>. The sequel to Warhorse’s highly successful medieval roleplaying game, which was postponed multiple times, will be officially released on February 4, 2025.</p>



<p>In this one, you’ll be able to traverse an even larger game world inspired by medieval Bohemia. As the main character Heinrich, you’ll have to prove yourself through numerous battles, both physical and verbal, while dealing with some light survival mechanics like hunger and hygiene.</p>

<p>Sony made a lot of PC gamers happy when it started bringing some choice PlayStation-exclusive franchises to the PC…then made a lot of them angry by requiring a PlayStation Network account to play them. This backlash started last year with <em>Helldivers 2,</em> but <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2324284/sony-surrenders-helldivers-2-wont-require-playstation-login-on-pc.html">after a quick retreat</a>, Sony insisted PSN logins would be standard going forward. It looks like Sony has relented, at least on some PC games.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/">PlayStation blog post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601909/playstation-is-dropping-its-account-linking-requirement-for-some-pc-games">The Verge</a>), PSN account logins a

<p>While Dell makes some big, bombastic gaming displays and top-of-the-line monitors for creative pros, most people I know look to Dell for affordable and solid screens. Today’s deal delivers on that, with a 27-inch monitor and a high-quality IPS panel <a href="https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/4596309/Dell-S-Series-S2725HS-27-Display/">for just $159.99 at Office Depot</a>. That’s $60 off the original retail price.</p>



<p>The Dell S2725DS<strong> </strong>is a fairly straightforward design, without any gaming features or a curved panel. But its 2560×1440 resolution is a big step up from what you usually get in this price range, plus the IPS screen has much better color accuracy than the usual VA panels on budget monitors. (I personally use a similar Dell display in my own home office to make sure colors are right in Photoshop.)</p>

<p>Chrome Sync is one of the best features of Google’s world-dominating web browser. The ability to switch between devices and maintain the same bookmarks, passwords, tabs, etc. is a godsend. Not to mention newer features like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2458864/chrome-makes-it-easier-to-move-tabs-between-mobile-and-desktop.html">moving tabs between mobile and desktop</a>.</p>



<p>Sadly, Chrome Sync is being deprecated on older versions of the browser, according to a recent <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/321051266">Google community post</a> — specifically, versions of Chrome that are “more than four years old.” While it hasn’t happened yet, it will start in “early 2025.”</p>

<p>Large language model AI companies have been aggressively scraping content off the web for years, and many of them are known for ignoring things like copyright or the robots.txt files used by sites to stop search engines.

<p>Scareware is a type of malware that relies on scare tactics to get you to lower your guard and unknowingly install malware or give away sensitive personal data before you realize you’re being tricked. Typically, these scare tactics are full-screen alerts that mimic antivirus warnings.</p>



<p>One of the most nefarious examples of scareware is the “tech support scam,” which falsely warn that your device is affected with malware and that you need to call a fake support number or install fake anti-malware software to clean it up and restore things. You may have even seen a few Microsoft IT support scam pop-ups yourself over the years.</p>
