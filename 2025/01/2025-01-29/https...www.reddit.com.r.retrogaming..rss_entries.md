<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I dont blame them nor am I complaining. With such small games, most of them anyways, it was the only option they had. Well until the PS1, N64 and Sega Saturn era where saving started to really take place. It&#39;s just such a eye opener to what we have now through the evolution of gaming. In fact, I almost feel like it&#39;d a detriment to make overly long games now because players don&#39;t seem to even bother finishing them. Much less buy them based on statistics with achievements/trophies. </p> <p>What do you guys think?

Games from that era still hold up in so many ways (music , gameplay, graphics). It felt like gaming wasn’t afraid to experiment and there was so much creativity. </p> <p>A close second is the ps2/xbox/gamecube era. Console online gaming, local co op, gameplay was more important over story. One thing I also love about this generation was not every game felt the same (I miss when gaming genres felt distinct), the average video game could be beaten in a weekend (8-10 hours if that).
