Also that a side can get dirty? I think my local stores are okay on cleanness. But I could be wrong about that like maybe someone else was and wants to inform me not to make the same mistake lol.

It&#39;s intriguing and is one I&#39;m interested in exploring if at all possible, but none of the online versions I&#39;ve tried has been coded with accessibility in mind, and the physical game seems as if it would be somewhat hard to make accessible in any case.</p> <p>That being said, I wondered if anyone has maybe made a command-line version of the game? I realize the thematic aspect of the game would be kind of lost, but from an accessibility perspective something bear bones would be ideal.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried the version on BGA, which has <strong>some</strong> readable components, but the experience is confusing and I have no way to know what my verifiers are telling me, which rather defeats the purpose. </p> <p>I&#39;d love any thoughts on this admittedly odd question.
