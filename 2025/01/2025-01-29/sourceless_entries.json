The deliberations between the companies are at an early stage, the sources said, cautioning that a deal is not guaranteed and it's possible that NEC would decide not to submit a formal bid for CSG.",

The crypto industry donated millions of dollars to support Trump's return to the White House and expectations of a more favorable regulatory setup powered bitcoin to record highs in 2024, surpassing $100,000 for the first time.  The new additions also include Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Luis Alberto Moreno, a global development and international finance expert.",

        "description": "This is the latest video that introduces my serious PhD issue (bullying, intimidation, coercion, discrimination, and retaliation by PhD promoter Prof. Zofia Lukszo) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands\n\nMy name is Hanxin Zhao, a PhD candidate from TU Delft. I could have finished the PhD timely in 4 years, but during the PhD, for many times, I was forced to work by the promoter (Prof.Zofia Lukszo), which caused 2 years delay (also in a self-funded situation). Now I have sufficiently met requirement for graduation (with 4 Q1-ranked journal paper published, few PhDs can achieve in the faculty), shockingly, I didn\u2019t get PhD degree after 6 years effort/time paid, but suffered the retaliation from the promoter by terminating my PhD for failing to reach the minimum requirement. The issue involves many scandals, and I hereby report it to the public and hope to get answers from TU Delft for the below questions:\n\n1. A PhD supervised by the same promoter graduated with only 1 Q3-r",
