        "description": "Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! A couple days ago I made a serious mistake where I bought a new AAA game on my computer only to receive problems. Turns out Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on PC did have some issues with older software causing conflicts and when I replace two simple files, most issues were alleviated. It wasn't just me having these problems but a whole bunch of gamers and Square needs to address it. Thanks for watching!\nLike, Comment and Subscribe for more videos!",
