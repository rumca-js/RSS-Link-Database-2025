Today, we unbox a kingly gift from our friend at Woodsted Studios!  One of the most memorable pieces of concept art from The Hobbit films is Thorin Oakenshield's royal armor - one version with a raven helm.  Woodsted Studios has recreated this EPIC helm in one of the most jaw-dropping pieces I've ever unboxed!
