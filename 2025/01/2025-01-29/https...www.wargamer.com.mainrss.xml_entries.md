This Greninja Ex is undeniably an amazing looking SVP Black Star Promo, but we’re still surprised to see copies going for $60 online - double the RRP of the box they were sold in last year.</p>

								<p>Hold Back the Dead is the next free DnD adventure coming from Wizards of the Coast, which will be available for registered DnD Beyond users to claim on February 4. WotC hasn’t said anything much about this freebie adventure so far, but the central premise - defending a “mighty fortress” from “hordes of deadly monsters” - is giving us real vibes of Bloons TD and other tower defense games.</p>
