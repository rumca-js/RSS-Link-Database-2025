I also like thrillers, mysteries, WLW romance, memoirs. I&#39;m honestly open to reading pretty much anything, but here are some things that I prefer in books that can make it challenging for me to find a good read: -prefer 1st person perspective - I try to only read books written by women (last year I read almost 50 books and only two were written by a man) - I don&#39;t want smut. A little bit of spice is okay, but I like plot. I&#39;m here for the plot, just tell me a story. </p> <p>Here are some books I have read this year that I really enjoyed: One of Us Knows - Alyssa Cole Sharks don&#39;t Sink - Jasmin Graham When we Were Silent - Fiona McPhillips Bunny - Mona Awad Keep Your Friends Close - Leah Konan Black Sheep - Rachel Harrison </p> <p>I know thats a lot, but any recommendations greatly appreciated! üòÉ

He found one that had plants/bushes that seemed to move with music or sound. He found maybe 7-8 other planets each with different types of aliens. If I remember correctly, each new chapter was a new world/alien. In the second or third to last chapter he does finally find a human similar type alien that harvests plants and th

It references the story of Eurydice and Orpheus and sets a vibe of a taboo romance, with a slightly arrogant tone I cant quite explain. Music can be interpreted in many ways but I&#39;ve always felt powerful after listening to the song, it takes my breath away much like books do. So why not combine the two? </p> <p>Books that just remind you of his music is fine as well! If you&#39;re not familiar with his music (which I highly recommend) novels inspired by eurydice and Orpheus or Greek mythology in general is welcomed. Always super

I guess I just want a book or a multiple book series that has morally grey characters and great plot twists along with very descriptive writing. Idk, maybe I am making no sense and am just struggling with the fact GRRM will probably release TWOW and ADOS.
