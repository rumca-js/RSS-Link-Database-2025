Its not so much the money I would make off of it, because I know it would only be a few dollars a month maybe. But I hate big tech making billions while off of me. This would be the perfect solution to the &quot;universal basic income&quot; issue that the tech bros used to talk about.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone, long time lurker here! I have been slowly degoogling for the past few years. Unfortunately, my work uses google workspace for everything. I still need to access information from my personal phone (iphone), especially my calendar. I have tried to add the work google calendar as a subscription to the iphone calendar but keep getting a validation failed message. I do not want to be logged into google anywhere on my phone, which is the solution I keep seeing. Any suggestions? I know I can log in via a browser, but it is so clunky, and it logs me out automatically every 12 hours. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chippiebing"> /u/chippiebing </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1id09ox/work_calendar/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1id09ox/work_calendar/">[comments]</a></span>

While my wife keeps using Google services (on an iPhone), I (also on an iPhone) was able to quit all services except for Calendar. I need a calendar provider that offers sharing across platforms but can be integrated into Google Calendar and should allow editing events within Google‘s app. I am open to any provider so it doesn’t have to be the Apple calendar at all. </p> <p>I read about Tuta or Proton (which I am subscribed to) but they require all users to use their service which fails the condition that my wife will stick with Google calendar (I guess but I might try my luck). </p> <p>TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sklation1987"> /u/sklation1987 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogl
