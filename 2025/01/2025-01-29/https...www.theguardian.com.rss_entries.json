I feel like I am doing a lot for my $45 per hour. I am caring for a woman in the throes of labour. Her eyes are glassy, her vocalisations frantic. She is in transition, a time in labour you can feel terrified and out of control. I hold her and ground her with my well-practised voice, refined from more than 10 years of experience.</p><p>I set up a baby Resuscitaire in case it is needed. I document heart rates and clean up body fluids while also educating a student working with me. We write down vital signs and draw up drugs ready to administer. Do you know that midwives can initiate dosages of morphine, antibiotics and other drugs without having to bother a doctor?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/30/i-am-a-midwife-in-a-nsw-hospital-this-is-what-a",

        "description": "<p>We didn\u2019t want our opponents to get a sniff this series and victory at the MCG will ensure they have a clean sweep hanging over their heads in the future</p><p>It\u2019s a rare privilege when we get to play a Test. The pinnacle of Australian cricket is putting on your baggy green and this one is even more special and historic as the first day-night Test at the MCG. The opportunity to showcase women\u2019s Test cricket on the big arena will be really important, not only for the game itself but for the group that gets to run out there on Thursday.</p><p>It\u2019s always like a carrot dangled in front of us when there\u2019s a Test match to be played because we don\u2019t do it that often. It brings a lot more energy and excitement to the group. The vibe is high at the moment, just around the occasion itself and having all our family and friends coming to watch. Hopefully the public gets right behind us and comes out in droves too.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/29/australia-are-out-",
