This review of the NVIDIA RTX 5080 graphics card tests the new GPU vs. the RTX 5090, AMD RX 7900 XTX, NVIDIA RTX 4080, 3080, 2080 Ti, and more. Our benchmarks and review of the RTX 5080 compare it to the best video cards out in 2025 (so far) to determine gaming performance via framerate, efficiency and power consumption, and thermal performance of the Founders Edition cooling solution. The RTX 5080 is part of NVIDIA's new Blackwell architecture and includes a number of aspects being tested in separate follow-ups, including dual blow-through cooling for the FE (being tested in ITX), MFG (Multi-Frame Generation) that we have an explainer coming for, and transient power consumption alongside GPU thermals. Today's review focuses on the RTX 5080 and whether it's worth it as compared to other NVIDIA and AMD cards. We'll also address NVIDIA's problematic marketing (again).
