<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is this neat framework <a href="https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand">https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand</a> which builds on play wright, but adds AI in the way that you can trigger actions and extract content without using any classic selectors. I think this is the future, as is makes web automation so much more stable. Do you know if there is anything similar, but for python? I know <a href="https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai">https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai</a>, but to my understanding there is no feature where I can just say &quot;click the login button&quot;.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cbs_i"> /u/cbs_i </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1id3lp4/an_ai_web_browsing_framework_similar_to_stagehand/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1id3lp4/an_ai_web_browsing_framework_similar_to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I am tasked with scraping price and availability for about 100 - 200 products listed in amazon. I have built a selenium solution which iterates through all the SKU IDs and render the Amazon URL and then get the pricing from the xpaths. Problem it is slow and sometimes end up in captchas.</p> <p>I have never worked with hidden APIs and stuff. So is it a possible solution I could look into for Amazon (like looking into fetch/xhr requests and curl stuff... Not very knowledgeable here) ? If yes, could refer me to some repo. Or if not, is it just for Amazon? Like can I look into this solution for other websites </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/polaristical"> /u/polaristical </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1id342q/help_with_scraping/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1id342q/help_with_scraping/">[comments]</a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am planning on building a large-scale web scraping project and want to ask some questions on the subject of how the server to-be-scraped ‘sees’ the activity. </p> <p>some companies provide documentation for the APIs they implement to populate their frontend with data and some don’t. For the latter case, if someone were to use selenium to scrape their site, how exactly would this activity appear to the server owners? </p> <p>If I were to use a range of proxies, and added some randomness into the selenium script, would the server to-be-scraped just ‘see’ ‘normal users’ accessing their site from these various proxies? Are there any indicators, and what would these be, from their perspective that their site is being scraped by an automated script? If so, how can one obscure these indicators? </p> <p>Thank you for your help and time reading this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://w
