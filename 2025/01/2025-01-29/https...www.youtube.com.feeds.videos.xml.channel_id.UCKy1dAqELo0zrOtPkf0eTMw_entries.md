In today's Daily Fix:
Lots of PlayStation news today. February's selection of PS Plus Essentials games have been revealed, headlined by Payday 3. Leadership at Sony is getting a shake-up, with a new Sony CEO announced, and the head of Sony Interactive being confirmed. And finally, for PC gamers who had a real issue signing up for a PlayStation account just to play PlayStation games, Sony is backing off of that a little bit. But PC players who are signed in to a PS account will get special incentives depending on the game they're playing.

Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man reviewed by Joshua Yehl on Disney+

Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man is a marvelously good time. By swapping out Tony Stark as Peter Parker’s mentor and replacing him with Norman Osborn, we’re treated to 10 episodes of insidiously fun superhero TV. Given how it ends, it’s clear Marvel has a lot of juicy (and unexpected) new ideas they’re eager to explore in the second and third seasons Disney+ has already ordered. This is a truly fresh take on Spider-Man filled with many delightful surprises, from fun superhero cameos to shocking plot twists. The inclusion of real-world issues does give it an air of authenticity, although it’s essentially window dressing for a fun action show with great characters. And while the animation has some distracting quirks, overall, it works quite well. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man has lively pacing, the writing is as sharp as a scorpion’s tail, and it finds new ways to make you laugh and gasp every episod

Rift of the NecroDancer reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PC, also available on Nintendo Switch.

You could wear out your keyboard slapping arrow keys to the beat and jamming in your seat to Rift of the NecroDancer’s excellent soundtrack, fervently chasing down a perfect run of a song for hours. Whether you're fighting stuffy puppet masters, rhythmically ridding the world of monsters, or just waddling around in a silly mole costume, it provides many excellent flavors of arcade-style rhythm action. Even though this “Greatest Hits” anthology isn’t as focused or Earth-shattering as Brace Yourself Games’ genre-bending debut album, it still continually surprises and delights by providing clever twists on time-tested mechanics.
