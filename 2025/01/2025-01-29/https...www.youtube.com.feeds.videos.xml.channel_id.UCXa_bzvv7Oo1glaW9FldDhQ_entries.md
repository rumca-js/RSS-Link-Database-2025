From one of the few iconic 3D tower defense games at the start to one of the few left, Robot Entertainment's Orcs Must Die! is still going strong, even surviving an unsuccessful free-to-play spin-off. Its latest title, Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, throw some rogue-lite wrenches into the traditional trap-heavy approach, and the results are mostly satisfying.

After choosing from one of six playable War Mages, players choose from a mission, taking on a negative modifier. It's a game of attrition as you set up traps, funnelling ever-increasing waves of Orcs to their death, ideally before they reach the Rift. There's plenty to uncover in Deathtrap between each environment's challenges, employing different traps, positive modifiers, upgrades, and more.

While the core formula hasn't changed much, and the rogue-lite elements could use more quality of life (not to mention less grinding), Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap is an enjoyable tower defense experience. Just make sure to bring some friends alo

Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was a surprise announcement at Microsoft’s recent Xbox Developer Direct presentation, but the shadow dropped remaster has quickly won over our hearts all over again. 

Back in 2008, the original Ninja Gaiden 2 was lauded as one of the greatest action games ever made, and over a decade and a half later, it’s remastered/remake release is just as much of a blast to play. 

Above all else, however, it also hammers home the notion that shorter, more contained, linear games are never going to go out of style. The focused drive and brevity of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black are among its biggest strengths, and thankfully, it’s one of several examples of games that benefit from just that.

Despite how stacked January has been, February is arguably the month everyone has been looking forward to. It doesn't contain all of the biggest releases of 2025, but there are some heavy hitters.

Perhaps the most notable is Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, an open-world medieval action RPG with more of everything that made the first game great. A bigger world, more quests, better combat - you name it. Of course, a very large subset of players is looking forward to Monster Hunter Wilds, which offers a massive world to explore, complete with new skills, monsters, mechanics, and more.

A little over a year later, RGG Studio is already back with Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, offering hack-and-slash gameplay, naval combat, and that same mix of lighthearted and serious story-telling. Then you have Avowed, the long-delayed first-person RPG, but these are only a handful of the titles. Check out all the big games in February 2025.
