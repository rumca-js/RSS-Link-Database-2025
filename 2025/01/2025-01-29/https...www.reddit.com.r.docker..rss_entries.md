## Radarr and Sonarr containers not showing correct amount available

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Though the title may be misleading, i believe this issue is related to docker. I have Sonarr and Radarr containers running in docker, and I believe I mounted the volumes from my external HDD correctly in the docker compose file. However, my R+S web interfaces show the root folder as only having 57gb available. The HDD is 14Tb. Any thoughts as to why this is? Do I have to mount something correctly? I am new to this, so thank you in advance! My server is a Mac Mini BTW.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cantseasharp"> /u/cantseasharp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1id2joh/radarr_and_sonarr_containers_not_showing_correct/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1id2joh/radarr_and_sonarr_containers_not_showing_correct/">[comments]</a></span>

This older version was set up using the container manager in a Synology NAS, but I want to try docker compose for the new one.</p> <p>First, my /config wasn&#39;t mapped, so I&#39;ve now created /volume1/docker_config/Radarr/config and copied the files from the container&#39;s config folder. </p> <p>Is it possible to find how it was configured last time?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent the last 3-4 days reading up on Docker because I&#39;d really love to use it in my next project. I&#39;ve got the very basics down now, but after reading a bunch of docs and watching YouTube tutorials, I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to make it do exactly what I want. I&#39;d love it if someone could nudge me in the right direction and point me towards which parts of Docker I can read up on more that will suit my use-case.</p> <p>So essentially I want to deploy an application like this:</p> <ol> <li>A stateless frontend server inside its own Docker container. This will be a Next.js server (frontend only) that serves static files SSRed using data from the backend.</li> <li>A stateless backend server inside its own Docker container. This will serve a REST API.</li> <li>A database hosted by a third party. This will not be containerized.</li> <li>An Nginx reverse proxy. This can be containerized or not - whatever&#39;s simpler.</li> </o
