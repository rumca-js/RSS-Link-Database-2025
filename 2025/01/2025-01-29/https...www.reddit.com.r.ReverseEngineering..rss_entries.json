I am on a few forms on Facebook and here trying to find workarounds and thought maybe somebody could see if they have any ideas cuz I have no idea how to do any of this stuff but really want to use my underwater drone in the local Quarry. If you want to know what it is and what the app looks like you can go on YouTube and search for Power Ray underwater drone. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cdnstudman\"> /u/cdnstudman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://powervision.me/en/product/powerray/download\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ich60h/bypass_login_on_app_company_went_out_of_business/\">[comments]<",
