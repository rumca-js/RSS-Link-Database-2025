You need to be prepared to handle cases where you might be surveilled via your phone in unexpected situations. Maybe there's a demonstration or riot near you. Maybe you feel like someone is hacking you. Maybe you're having a meeting that you want to ensure is private. Maybe you're entering a high security building. If you understand how the phone is used to track you, you can have the correct strategies. In the long term you should have a de-Googled phone. But absent that for short term use, this video will assume you do not.
