Archaeologists in Ecuador have uncovered the remains of a pregnant woman who lived 1,200 years ago during the Manteño period. The burial, which included valuable trade artifacts like Spondylus shells and obsidian blades, suggests a ritual sacrifice, though the exact motivations remain unclear. Fractures on her skull indicate she may have died from a fatal blow, and her dismembered body, with missing hands and legs, further suggests violent treatment. The inclusion of another person’s skull and burnt offerings points to the ritualistic nature of the burial. Experts believe her death could have been tied to agricultural difficulties caused by El Niño or to eliminate a powerful figure within the community. The burial offers insights into ancient social and ritual practices.

Using data from the DESI Legacy Surveys photometry catalog, 19 new quasars were identified, including strongly-lensed, dual, and projected types. Observations were carried out on October 15–16, 2023, at California's Palomar Observatory using the P200/DBSP instrument. Among the findings are two lensed quasars, J0746+1344 and J2121-0826, which exhibit unusual configurations, six dual quasars at varying redshifts and separations, and 11 projected quasars with significant distances. These discoveries enhance understanding of supermassive black holes and their role in shaping the universe. Systems like J0422+0047, once thought to be lensed quasars, reveal more complex alignments.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, set to begin its 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) later this year, will track millions of Type Ia supernovae to advance our understanding of dark energy. These supernovae, resulting from white dwarf stars in binary systems, will be studied in detail to provide crucial data on the universe’s accelerating expansion. The consistent brightness of these explosions allows astronomers to measure cosmic distances and examine how dark energy influences the cosmos. Rubin’s extensive data will help resolve ongoing questions about whether dark energy has remained constant or evolved over time.

Microscopic organisms found in the tropical peatlands of Peru’s northwestern Amazon are helping regulate the carbon cycle, a key factor in Earth’s climate. These microbes, part of the Bathyarchaeia group, thrive in waterlogged, oxygen-deprived conditions and exhibit unique metabolic behaviours that either store or release carbon. Researchers warn that disturbances in the peatland ecosystem, such as deforestation or climate change, could release massive amounts of greenhouse gases, escalating global warming. The study highlights the importance of preserving these ecosystems for future climate stability.

Chonkus, a mutant strain of cyanobacterium, has been found to store more carbon and sink faster than typical strains. Discovered by Max Schubert and his team at the Wyss Institute, this microbe could assist in carbon sequestration efforts. Chonkus' quick sinking ability and high carbon storage capacity suggest it may play a role in reducing atmospheric carbon levels, especially in ocean-floor environments enriched with carbon dioxide.

Efforts to unravel dark matter's mysteries have revealed a potential mass limitation due to its interaction with the Higgs boson. A new study suggests that dark matter particles exceeding a few thousand giga-electron volts (GeV) could disrupt the Higgs boson, altering fundamental physical laws. This finding challenges the Standard Model and prompts scientists to focus on lighter dark matter candidates, like axions, which align with certain theoretical models. Ongoing research into dark matter could transform our understanding of the universe's structure and

Electric propulsion technology, powered by ion engines, is gaining traction for its efficiency in space travel. However, challenges such as back-scattered electrons from the ion plume threaten spacecraft components like solar arrays and antennas. Recent research by scientists from the University of Virginia and the University of Southern California, published in Plasma Sources Science and Technology, explores electron behaviour in ion engine exhaust. These findings pave the way for enhanced designs, ensuring safer and longer missions powered by reliable electric propulsion systems.

NASA’s X-59, part of the Quiet SuperSonic Technology (Quesst) programme, has successfully completed afterburner tests, bringing it closer to achieving quieter supersonic flight. Built by Lockheed Martin, the X-59 is designed to break the sound barrier without generating the disruptive sonic booms typically associated with supersonic travel. The recent tests at Lockheed’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, confirmed the jet’s ability to meet its speed requirements while operating within temperature limits. The next phase involves flight tests, including measuring the shockwaves produced during supersonic flight. NASA plans to fly the X-59 over select residential areas to gauge public response to the quieter “sonic thumps,” a crucial step toward making commercial supersonic flights a reality.
