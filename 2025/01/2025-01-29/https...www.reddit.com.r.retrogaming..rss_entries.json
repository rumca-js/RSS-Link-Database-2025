I need to say that Metroid is so cryptic too me and i&#39;m so frustrating about game over with minimum hp every start. The same i can say about The Legend of Zelda - i&#39;m just tried this game for a six hours and it feels boring, even that it is quite sparing to my defeats. For more, i&#39;m tried Kid Icarus and that&#39;s just very hard to me, this game is still not taking me in after 4 hours playing.

Games from that era still hold up in so many ways (music , gameplay, graphics). It felt like gaming wasn\u2019t afraid to experiment and there was so much creativity. </p> <p>A close second is the ps2/xbox/gamecube era. Console online gaming, local co op, gameplay was more important over story. One thing I also love about this generation was not every game felt the same (I miss when gaming genres felt distinct), the average video game could be beaten in a weekend (8-10 hours if that). Id honestly say if modern games stuck with ps2 era graphics I\u2019d be fine with it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pirateslifeisntforme\"> /u/pirateslifeisntforme </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1icklme/whats_your_favorite_console_generation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",

We&#39;d mainly want to emulate the N64, GameCube, the Xbox, and maybe the PS2. I&#39;m hoping to use an OS specifically because we like the charm that a console interface brings.
