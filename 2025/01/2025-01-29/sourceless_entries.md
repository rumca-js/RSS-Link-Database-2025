This is the latest video that introduces my serious PhD issue (bullying, intimidation, coercion, discrimination, and retaliation by PhD promoter Prof. Zofia Lukszo) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands

My name is Hanxin Zhao, a PhD candidate from TU Delft. I could have finished the PhD timely in 4 years, but during the PhD, for many times, I was forced to work by the promoter (Prof.Zofia Lukszo), which caused 2 years delay (also in a self-funded situation). Now I have sufficiently met requirement for graduation (with 4 Q1-ranked journal paper published, few PhDs can achieve in the faculty), shockingly, I didn’t get PhD degree after 6 years effort/time paid, but suffered the retaliation from the promoter by terminating my PhD for failing to reach the minimum requirement. The issue involves many scandals, and I hereby report it to the public and hope to get answers from TU Delft for the below questions:
