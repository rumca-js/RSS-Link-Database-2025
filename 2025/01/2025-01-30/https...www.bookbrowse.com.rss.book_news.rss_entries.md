The Authors Guild has launched a certification system, "Human Authored," intended to provide authors and publishers with a way to distinguish their work in an "increasingly AI-saturated market." The system will provide an official mark on books registered by its author or publisher through a public database, indicating whether the text of a book was written by a human.
