If you want to better understand how AI might be dangerous, you can read their recent post explaining why we can't just 'switch off' a dangerous AI at https://futureoflife.org/ai/could-we-switch-off-a-dangerous-ai/. For more resources on AI and to learn more about the Future of Life Institute, visit their website at https://futureoflife.org/cause-area/artificial-intelligence/.\n\nArtificial Intelligence always takes over humanity in the movies when it gains consciousness. But even without getting into sentience, it's capable of influencing our lives in a lot of ways already.\n\nHosted by: Stefan Chin (he/him)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon s",
