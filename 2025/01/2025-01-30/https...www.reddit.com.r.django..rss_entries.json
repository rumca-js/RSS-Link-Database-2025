Are there any large scale self hosted apps (like Nextcloud, MediaWiki, etc) that use Django as their backend that I could look at to study? I want to make sure that the code is as portable as possible, so one thing I did is use socket.getfqdn() to populate the CORS fields and such in settings. But what about updates? Sure, I can just drop the new views and model and serializer files in place, but what&#39;s the best practice for doing migrations and such?

It seems best-practices and experience aren&#39;t my strong-suit.</p> <p>I have a model that has a field which can be EITHER a weight or a volume. In other words, you can choose X with 25 floz, or you can choose X with 50grams. Right now, the basic form is just showing both, and letting the user choose. It takes up real-estate and it means the user has to make a choice. The other way would be to just force everything to a single field, and figure it out in the logic but make it more complex.</p> <p>What&#39;s your thoughts and experience? Keep it simple but give more choices, or minimalize and push to logic? Or, perhaps there&#39;s a third option I haven&#39;t considered?</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a0pha1i8r1ge1.png?width=1676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=282d763ca217e16befe6843b31fba686f417af6b\">https://preview.redd.it/a0pha1i8r1ge1.png?width=167",
