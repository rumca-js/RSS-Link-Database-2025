The class winner had to read some pages of a book aloud to half the school and compete with students from other schools. Me, the 12 year old introvert with severe social anxiety did not like that and faked being sick. Some girl from my class got the second place and read aloud to the school. She did not win the competition. My classmates were angry at me because I would&#39;ve been so much better and blamed me for &quot;our&quot; loss. So I started to hate reading.

I liked the mood that it puts you in. The writing style was super immersive</p> <p>- I liked the book&#39;s themes of feeling lost, grief, sorrow, and being desensitized.</p> <p>- The slice of life storytelling style -- there&#39;s no one main overarching plotline, its simply a journey alongside the main character. I didn&#39;t mind the slower pacing, it left space for more details where I really felt like I could wander around in that world.</p> <p>What I disliked about Norwegian Wood:</p> <p>- Side characters (especially the women) often seemed one-dimensional</p

I’m interested as to what books if any reinvigorated your love for reading. I tend to be drawn to the darker and heavier themes in life when it comes to fiction and most other forms of art. I want something that will provide a sense of wisdom and insight that you think someone my age ought to know, hopefully something you feel shaped you into the better version of yourself that you are today.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/killsmitty"> /u/killsmitty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iditkd/i_trying_to_back_into_reading_after_a_very_long/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iditkd/i_trying_to_back_into_reading_after_a_very_long/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, I&#39;ve been in a reading slump and then just binged 3 Ottessa Moshfegh books and NEED suggestions. I admit I&#39;ve been a strong fantasy reader most of my life but bought MYORAR on a whim and then ate up Homesick For Another World and Death In Her Hands. I want to get more into literary fiction because I&#39;m enjoying it so much more than fantasy. I recently bough Convenience Store Woman by Murata and Hag Seed by Atwood. I just love Moshfegh&#39;s style but want to branch out and see what else female writers have to offer. I&#39;ve got some work by Kafka just to dip my toes in but I really have to admit I love a strong female protagonist and I&#39;m (unfortunately) generally not going to get that with male authors. Any and all suggestions I will take! I just want to binge read as much as I can before I&#39;m slumped by uni starting back up soon. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/k

Myah Hollis “Not about a boy” book is the perfect coming of age story on grief, depression and learning to grow and self reflect. I always had a hard time expressing how I felt during those Early years but that’s okay because somehow Myah Hollis character “Amalie” transcends the words I felt and put them to a page. I feel very word, there is rage, and sadness. Most importantly it’s a book about a girl who just needs love. And sometimes the most important love comes from within.

Like I really like Sean Baker&#39;s movies, stuff with flawed, scrappy characters with big personalities who are just doing whatever it takes to get by. Also like stuff like Midnight Cowboy, Tokyo Godfathers, A Dog Day Afternoon. </p> <p>Preferably nothing that&#39;s comes off like tragedy porn or anything too sappy/sentimental. I would like it to be somewhat optimistic though or have moments of levity.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Duemont8"> /u/Duemont8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1idb0d8/tragicomedies_about_people_who_are_down_on_their/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1idb0d8/tragicomedies_about_people_who_are_down_on_thei

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished the first Shatter Me book and enjoyed it more than I though I would. I want to read a book with a similar dynamic to Juliette and Warners, but I don&#39;t want to finish the series because I loathe Juliette 80% of the time. I would prefer if it was an mlm book since that is what I read mostly (I&#39;m a gay man please don&#39;t hate). I tried Google and some other subreddits to find something but came up empty. Does anyone have a suggestion? Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LegitimateWorry4031"> /u/LegitimateWorry4031 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1idarbv/gay_shatter_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1idarbv/gay_shatter_me/">[comments]</a></span>
