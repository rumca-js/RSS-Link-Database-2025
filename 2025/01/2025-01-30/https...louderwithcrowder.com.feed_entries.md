	In October of 2007, a small but consequential meeting was taking place. The parish of a small Episcopal church met with the bishop after his yearly visit. They were discussing doctrine. A parishioner stood up and asked, ‚ÄúDo you believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven?‚Äù
</p><p>
	It is the fundamental belief in Christianity. Jesus Christ is the Son of God was sent to Earth as a sacrifice for man so that we may be redeemed for our sins. It is the very least and the very most when it comes to Christianity.

	Someone should really inform Paulsboro Councilman Theodore Holloway that when you commit a moving violation, you tend to get pulled over.
</p><p>
	Holloway was pulled over for failing to stop at a stop sign. As an elected official, he believed he was above the law, so he decided to blast the cops who were doing their job.
