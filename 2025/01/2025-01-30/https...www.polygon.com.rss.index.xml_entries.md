<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before Polygon, video game lovers relied on print magazines to pass time at school, on commutes, and during slow days at work when the boss wasn’t looking. In the ‘90s, I checked the mailbox each day for the latest issue from publications like Electronic Gaming Monthly and GamePro, dog-earing pages so I could quickly revisit tiny, fuzzy images of upcoming PlayStation games that looked — to my childhood eyes — like graphical miracles. When I left for college, my parents hurled my dusty boxes full of mags into the dump. I assumed I’d never again see the <a href="https://www.retromags.com/rmg_fs/gallery_imgs/monthly_2023_03/large.1343077819_GameProScaryLarryAdventures(December1995).
