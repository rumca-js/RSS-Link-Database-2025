<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I created my new iCloud account recently and it was supposed to be empty since I do not upload anything on iCloud at all.</p> <p>However, the storage suddenly shows there are 27.7KB invisible documents on iCloud, which I cannot find them at all either on my devices or iCloud web. And now it suddenly went up to 85.4KB while I was not even using it.</p> <p>I request the dataset and it shows &quot;icloud.is.workflow.my.workflows&quot; created the KB, does anyone know what is it? Are they system files? Or could they be virus?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asianhk"> /u/asianhk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1id8t0f/what_is_icloudisworkflowmyworkflows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1id8t0f/what_is_icloudisworkflowmyworkflows/">[comments]</a></span>
