I even got nominated for some dumb reading competition that I was forced to participate in by teachers. The class winner had to read some pages of a book aloud to half the school and compete with students from other schools. Me, the 12 year old introvert with severe social anxiety did not like that and faked being sick. Some girl from my class got the second place and read aloud to the school. She did not win the competition. My classmates were angry at me because I would&#39;ve been so much better and blamed me for &quot;our&quot; loss. So I started to hate reading.

I admit I&#39;ve been a strong fantasy reader most of my life but bought MYORAR on a whim and then ate up Homesick For Another World and Death In Her Hands. I want to get more into literary fiction because I&#39;m enjoying it so much more than fantasy. I recently bough Convenience Store Woman by Murata and Hag Seed by Atwood. I just love Moshfegh&#39;s style but want to branch out and see what else female writers have to offer. I&#39;ve got some work by Kafka just to dip my toes in but I really have to admit I love a strong female protagonist and I&#39;m (unfortunately) generally not going to get that with male authors. Any and all suggestions I will take! I just want to binge read as much as I can before I&#39;m slumped by uni starting back up soon. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/k",
