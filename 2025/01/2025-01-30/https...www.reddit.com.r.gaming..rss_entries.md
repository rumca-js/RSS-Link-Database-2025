<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t like invasions but that stems from my distaste for PvP in general.</p> <p>In games it&#39;s not optional, I often wish it was.</p> <p>For example, Elden Ring is a game I used to enjoy with friends until the constant threat of invaders just kinda pushed me into playing that game alone indefinitely.</p> <p>I did beat Elden Ring eventually, mind you, just has a lot less fun doing it alone as I&#39;m a rather social person.</p> <p>The reason I decided to ask this is because Sniper Elite Resistance asked me if I wanted to enable Axis invasion and it reminded me that invasions exist to begin with.</p> <p>Want to note that I don&#39;t think invasions are a bad thing, I think they certainly have their place in games, I just rather play without them because. . . To be perfectly honest, I&#39;m not exactly great at PvP and having someone just appear, give me the finger and fuck off always does well to ruin my experience.</p> </div><!--

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Now I&#39;m not really asking about particular games per se. It&#39;s more of your rationale for why you made that choice. Do you go with your favorite game of all time? Your favorite story? The most challenging? The one that has the most variability? </p> <p>For me, my favorite game of all time is Chrono Trigger. This is a single player story driven JRPG. That being the case, it is a very similar playthrough every time I play it.</p> <p>Diablo 2 is a game where the end game is just loot farming, dueling, and theory crafting new builds. It&#39;s also online, so this would provide a lot of variability and the social aspect.</p> <p>Ori and the Blind Forest is a metroidvania with beautiful music, fluid controls, and it just feels really good to play. Lately I&#39;ve been playing a randomizer of the game, which shuffle what upgrades you get in each location, making the game play different every time I play it.</p> <p>I could name plenty of other games, b
