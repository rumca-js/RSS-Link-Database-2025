<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am learning that 10/10 means nothing. Too many web novels and light novels have fooled me for far too long, they suck. I love manga and anime, but I am starting to believe that the reason I love these stories is because the visual aspect brings about 50% of the story and the dialogue can usually be translated well. I don&#39;t know if I am just reading the wrong web novels/light novels, but it is a struggle to find something with actual good writing. I love Game of Thrones, Berserk, Brandon Sanderson, Dune, and after reading such good writing, its hard to read anything lesser. Harry Potter, The Cosmere, Earthsea, The First Law, all these books are incredible. I want to read a good web novel, but I havent found anything yet. Can yall help? Thanks! </p> <p>(LOTM looks very interesting and is on my TBR. Any of you think it has good writing?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Single-Discipline722"> /

Here is an excerpt </p> <pre><code>Pug danced along the edge of the rocks, his feet finding scant purchase as he made his way among the tide pools. His dark eyes darted about as he peered into each pool under the cliff face, seeking the spiny creatures driven into the shallows by the recently passed storm. His boyish muscles bunched under his light shirt as he shifted the sack of sandcrawlers, rockclaws, and crabs plucked from this water garden. The afternoon sun sent sparkles through the sea spray swirling around him, as the west wind blew his sun-streaked brown hair about. Pug set his sack do

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>I read this for SPFBO. To find out more about the SPFBO contest and to see the participating bloggers/authors and reviews follow the link below</strong> </p> <p>I’ve been hearing about Mushroom Blues for awhile and had totally the wrong idea of what it was going to be about. I’m not even sure what I thought it was going to be but I know mushroom crime noir was nowhere in the picture I had in my head. </p> <p>The story itself has a bit of that Japanese crime flair, and is set in a truly inspired fungal world. It’s a fast-paced story and it’s a very visual world. When I saw Blade Runner mentioned in promo, it led me to expect more of a punky, advanced cyber kind of city- this was not that at all and I thought it was very cool change from the norm. I really enjoyed the setting. </p> <p>Mushroom Blue’s story unfolds through it’s lead Henrietta Hoffman; a detective doing her stint (exile as she likes to refer to it) in Coprinia, and her partner Ko

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for recommendations for drier kinds of fantasy books. Dry may be the wrong word, but I don&#39;t know how else to describe it. Many of the fantasy books coming out now are too character-driven for me. With that, I mean too much inner monologue, the characters are (too) flawed and/or unsympathetic, and they (too) often have some sort of trauma in their life, which is (too) emphasized throughout the story. </p> <p>Let me say right away that none of these books are bad, and I&#39;ve read a lot of them. I just long for a more dry, removed, epic kind of fantasy. Not too dry (Strange&amp;Norrell didn&#39;t do it for me) but not so very emotional. Hoping to find someone who knows what I mean! Apologies if I&#39;m not describing it well enough. </p> <p>I prefer books with only one main character, except Lord of the Rings, which may very well be my all-time favorite book(s). Other authors I like are Ursula Le Guin (almost everything), Elizabet

I want something original, and as weird as it sounds, &#39;original&#39; seems to be what would be considered a &#39;prequel&#39; to almost every story.

Like, how can a warhost just march up to a realm&#39;s capital with NO warning whatsoever.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t mind too much, I simply shrugged it off and moved on to the next novel thinking it was a minor issue. But that&#39;s the thing, throughout Valour, SO MANY things just happen because of plot for the villains to win. The protagonists and their companions are getting killed off every other chapter while the villains are wearing such ridiculous plot armour. For every step forward
