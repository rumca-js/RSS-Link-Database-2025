I love manga and anime, but I am starting to believe that the reason I love these stories is because the visual aspect brings about 50% of the story and the dialogue can usually be translated well. I don&#39;t know if I am just reading the wrong web novels/light novels, but it is a struggle to find something with actual good writing. I love Game of Thrones, Berserk, Brandon Sanderson, Dune, and after reading such good writing, its hard to read anything lesser. Harry Potter, The Cosmere, Earthsea, The First Law, all these books are incredible. I want to read a good web novel, but I havent found anything yet. Can yall help? Thanks! </p> <p>(LOTM looks very interesting and is on my TBR. Any of you think it has good writing?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Single-Discipline722\"> /",

Dry may be the wrong word, but I don&#39;t know how else to describe it. Many of the fantasy books coming out now are too character-driven for me. With that, I mean too much inner monologue, the characters are (too) flawed and/or unsympathetic, and they (too) often have some sort of trauma in their life, which is (too) emphasized throughout the story. </p> <p>Let me say right away that none of these books are bad, and I&#39;ve read a lot of them. I just long for a more dry, removed, epic kind of fantasy. Not too dry (Strange&amp;Norrell didn&#39;t do it for me) but not so very emotional. Hoping to find someone who knows what I mean! Apologies if I&#39;m not describing it well enough. </p> <p>I prefer books with only one main character, except Lord of the Rings, which may very well be my all-time favorite book(s).
