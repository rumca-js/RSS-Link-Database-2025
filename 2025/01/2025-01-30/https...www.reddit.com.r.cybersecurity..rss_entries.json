I know their only concern would be making sure they\u2019re compliant but for you other tech wizards / consultants out there- what mistakes do you see SMBs make when it comes to protecting their data? And what do you think, they think is important / valuable in that space?</p> <p>Would love some insights so I can educate myself to educate them more lol.
