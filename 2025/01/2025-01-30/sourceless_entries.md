(Reuters) -Tesla shares gained 3% on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk vowed to launch long-awaited cheaper models in the first half of 2025 and start testing an autonomous ride-hailing service in June.  Tesla said on Wednesday it expected the vehicle business to return to growth this year, but did not repeat Musk's prediction from late last year that sales would grow 20% to 30% in 2025.  Tesla shares have rallied recently on hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump, whose election campaign Musk had backed with around a quarter-billion dollars in donations, would provide a clearer regulatory path for its robotaxis.

The European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected on Thursday and kept more easing on the table, sticking to its view that inflation in the euro zone is increasingly under control despite concerns about global trade.  The fifth ECB rate cut since June, which had been well telegraphed to the market, lowered the rate that the central bank pays on deposits to 2.75% from 3.0%.  The euro zone economy has remained weak, despite some signs of revival in the latest round of surveys, and inflation has hovered just above the ECB's 2% target, cementing the case for Thursday's rate cut.

Some of the world's smallest economies, especially in Africa, could be at increased risk of being unable to pay their debts in the medium term, even as developing nations have emerged from a series of sovereign defaults, financial adviser Lazard said.  Investors do not expect more sovereign defaults in 2025, but credit metrics for smaller and riskier countries, known as frontier markets, point to a structural weakening, especially for governments in Africa, Thomas Lambert, of Lazard's sovereign advisory team, said.  Markets expect it to be steady until June as Donald Trump's second administration has left the policy backdrop extremely uncertain.

"Wicked", a movie adaptation of the Broadway prequel to "The Wizard of Oz", earned roughly $700 million at the global box office, while the animated feature "The Wild Robot" grossed more than $300 million.  This helped power a near 7% rise in Comcast's studio revenue in the quarter and pushed its total revenue up 2.1% to $31.92 billion, beating estimates of $31.64 billion, according to LSEG data.  The results come at a crucial time for Comcast as it looks to unchain its main profit drivers such as studio and theme parks business from the declining cable TV unit by spinning off select NBCUniversal cable networks.

Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, has placed under review its 2028 goals for selling alternatives to smoking on the U.S. market, saying on Thursday it may not be able to meet them because of competition from disposable vapes.  Altria estimated the U.S. e-cigarette market grew 30% in 2024, driven mostly by "illicit disposable products" that represent 60% or more of the category even though they lack the required regulatory authorisations.  "We believe this dynamic compromises our ability to achieve our 2028 smoke-free volume and revenue goals," the company said in its full-year results statement on Thursday, adding it was re-assessing them as a result.
