## It's amazing how differently spicy scenes hit via audiobook in comparison to silent reading

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obligatory this is my own personal opinion/experience, and in no way do I assume others feel the same.</p> <p>Obviously much of it comes down to both the writing quality as well as the narrator quality, but for me personally, I can do nothing but cringe during spicy scenes of an audiobook. The crazy thing is that I&#39;m really the farthest thing from a prude. I&#39;m fully comfortable reading those scenes, watching them in any sort of visual media, talking about them, literally any other form is perfectly fine! And to add onto that, I&#39;ve even been a fan of spicy audio content before as well, just the kind that isn&#39;t read aloud from a book lol.</p> <p>And this remains true for me no matter if the book is specifically erotica/smut or if it&#39;s a fully plot-driven book that just so happens to have like one single spicy scene. It makes my skin crawl either way, and it has never once enhanced my listening experience. I can do descriptions/depic

In addition to whatever else I want to read, these goals usually represent a particularly long piece of work or series of works. I read through <em>The Wheel of Time</em> in one year, the <em>Ramayana</em> and the <em>Mahabharata</em> the year following, and last year I read through both Jane Austen&#39;s full body of work and did a study through Abrahamic literature by reading the Tanakh, the Bible, the Book of Enoch, the Apocrypha, Gnostic writings, the Qur&#39;an, and the Book of Mormon.

## Bad book from a favorite author.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You know, if an author has written enough books, then at some point he will stumble and write a bad book. Either he will start with a bad book, but gradually begin to write good ones, or vice versa, he will write good books at the beginning, but the latter will be worse. </p> <p>I mean, everyone has their favorite author, and so you take his random book, either the first or the last, and you realize that it&#39;s bad.</p> <p>For example (just an example, not my reading experience), Ira Levin. I liked his &quot;Rosemary&#39;s Baby,&quot; &quot;The Stepford Wives,&quot; and &quot;This Perfect Day.&quot; And I wanted to read his latest book, &quot;Son of Rosemary,&quot; and it was so bad. Everything that made the first part good is missing from the sequel. The atmosphere, the tension, the excellent villains.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mystery5009"> /u/mystery5009 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw this sentiment on twitter and it made me sad. I think I know what it means. Younger folk are consciously rejecting to engage with the great (or &quot;great&quot;) books of classic Western literature- as they&#39;re written by a bunch of dead white Europeans / European-descent, mostly men, and they have also somehow become co-opted into post-colonial nation-building efforts where countries like UK need serious refurbishing of its global image. (&quot;It&#39;s not that bad what we did to the world! We have- Shakespeare! And Jane Austen! Look, here&#39;s ANOTHER pretty period piece! HOLLYWOOD!&quot;)</p> <p>It still makes me sad, because these books (even if we can agree on the definitive list) are objectively good, and objectively worth anyone&#39;s time. and many were written by people who were from a social group who were deeply oppressed in their own time- women of course. But this seems to get lost.</p> <p>What do you think? Do you agree that
