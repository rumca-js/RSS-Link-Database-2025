We've survived on worlds with other people on them, but usually only in small numbers; rarely have we played with this many people on worlds this big. Similarly, while we've played large online worlds with many other people, rarely have they granted the kind of sandbox build-your-own-adventure freedom <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> does.

The game has an "early 2025" date, currently, which is the time period we're in. So a major press event held within that period of time would be a perfect place to make a release announcement. But no such announcement was made.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think">Read more</a></p>

On the one hand, this is a simply stunning game - albeit one that could stand to benefit from a wealth of improvements the PC platform could provide. On the other hand, this port follows in the wake of a truly awful PC rendition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, which Square-Enix has essentially left to rot since the last window. So, what's the score with Rebirth? Well, it is an improved port over Remake, for sure. One of the key problems with the PS5 version is addressed too, but even so, there are problems of

## Star Wars Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles is often Y2K movie gaming at its most frustrating, and yet it charms in a way that defies logic

A nice touch, even if it is just the EULA. Beyond that lies a very unusual prospect. This is a remaster of a game that is not really considered a classic. It's remembered, I suspect, with a mixture of fondness and frustration. Both of these emotions survive intact.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-episode-1-jedi-power-battles-is-often-y2k-movie-gaming-at-its-most-frustrating-and-yet-it-charms-in-a-way-that-defies-logic">Read more</a></p>
