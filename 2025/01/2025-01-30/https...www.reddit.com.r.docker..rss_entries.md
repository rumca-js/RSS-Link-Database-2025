<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everybody,</p> <p>just recently I started managing the docker containers on VSCode and I use Ubuntu 22.04 for it. For now I just use terminal but I am new Linux user.</p> <p>I look for efficient way to manage all new containers I create and spin it up. Recently I realized there is plugins like docker, dev containers etc. while looking for some terminal upgrades to manage containers.</p> <p>What tool will be best to use and learn? </p> <p>I basically create containers and need to run them and test typically I forget some libraries or some path are wrong as I still learn and need to repair it kill container do it again and check but I look for efficient way to do it also later I will have like 3-4 containers working together over faster api servers and want to use like docker composer at least that&#39;s what I found.</p> <p>Do you recommend anything else to use I will scale then this containers locally or on cloud and want to prepare any tips, good
