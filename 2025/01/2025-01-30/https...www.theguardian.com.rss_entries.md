<p>This was a rare case of Tottenham turning an injury into a positive. The loss of Radu Dragusin was Dane Scarlett’s cue. Recalled from a disappointing loan spell at Oxford United earlier this month, the 20-year-old striker came on for Dragusin and set Spurs on course to victory over Elfsborg when he headed in his first goal for his boyhood club.</p><p>It has been almost five years since Scarlett made his debut. He was an unlikely saviour but Ange Postecoglou was not complaining. There was more joy when another substitute, the 19-year-old winger, Oyindamola Ajayi, came on to score on his debut, then when Mikey Moore made it 3-0 with his first professional goal. Spurs had secured their place in the knockout phase. There was relief at avoiding two extra playoff games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/30/tottenham-elfsborg-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

David Beckham, who turns 50 this year, has released pictures of himself modelling his new bodywear collection for Hugo Boss. Bodywear, if you’re unfamiliar with the term, appears to mean underwear. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmB02oWLPiU">corresponding ad clip</a>, Beckham returns home for the day in his vintage Aston Martin, Bond-style, but he can’t wait to rip off his sharp suit and slouch around in a leather armchair in nothing but his tighty-whities. He has set the bar very high for middle-aged dads who like to relax by sitting around drinking in their pants, Homer Simpson-style. If you feel at all self-conscious about your soft, squishy, beer-induced centre, Beckham’s new line of smalls will not help.</p><p>In recent years, the dad bod seemed to be on the verge of widespread public acceptanc

<p><strong>Sherman theatre, Cardiff</strong> <br>Mared Jarman’s superb debut play, in which she stars, provides a portrait of reckless nightlife and prejudice towards disabled people</p><p>The title of Mared Jarman’s play translates as “For ever and Ever Amen”: a playfully pious invocation for a drama that is often darkly adult. It’s a Friday night in Cardiff and Lottie (also played by Jarman) is seeking her own form of salvation, be it through impromptu hotel Tinder hook-ups or trauma-bonding over lines of coke in nightclub toilets. As a portrait of grief and the prejudices experienced by disabled people, this is an assured and impassioned playwriting debut.</p><p><br><br>
 Jarman’s performance is equally fearless. Unapologetic depictions of female sexuality remain relatively rare in Welsh-language theatre, and for the play to also foreground the desires of a blind character feels innovative and overdue.

And it was a central tenet of punk that the 1960s and their attendant “culture freaks” were, as Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren put it: “fucking disgusting … vampiric … the most narcissistic generation there has ever been,” and that the decade’s famous names should no longer be afforded t

<p>Given what gen Z have been through, it’s no wonder they’re not impressed by democracy. But giving them a real stake in it could change everything</p><p>For God’s sake don’t give them the vote! Many people said that after a shocking poll published this week appeared to show young people rejecting democracy. But that’s utterly wrong. On the contrary, this should prompt Labour to accelerate its manifesto pledge to give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. They need more democracy, not less, and soon.</p><p>The Channel 4 poll found that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/genz-dictatorship-survey-jordan-peterson-b2686927.html">52% of 13- to 27-year-olds</a> think “the UK would be a better place if a strong leader” were in change “who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”, and 33% thought the country would be better run “if the army was in charge”, among other dark impulses.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian

<p><strong>Thibaudet/LA Philharmonic/Dudamel<br>(Decca)<br></strong>Jean-Yves Thibaudet, with Gustavo Dudamel and the LA Phil, are good fits for this theatrical piano concerto</p><p>This is a passion project for <a href="https://www.jeanyvesthibaudet.com/">Jean-Yves Thibaudet</a>, who has wanted to record <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/12/artsfeatures">Aram Khachaturian</a>’s Piano Concerto for more than two decades. The only question is why he didn’t get round to it sooner. Written in 1936 but little-known now, the concerto is a giant, Technicolor work that’s a great fit both for Thibaudet’s flamboyant yet precise playing style and for the LA Philharmonic and their conductor Gustavo Dudamel. Khachaturian, born in Georgia into an Armenian family, was a composer with one foot in Soviet Russia and one in the Caucasus, and that comes through in music that’s a distinctive, inseparable mixture of Russian popular Romanticism with eastern modes and harmonies.

<p><strong>Bergen Philharmonic/Wallroth/Mulligan/Gardner<br>(Chandos)<br></strong>Baritone Brian Mulligan impresses in Edward Gardner’s recording that is stronger on the work’s consolation than its celebration</p><p><a href="https://askonasholt.com/artist/edward-gardner">Edward Gardner</a> and his Bergen Philharmonic forces offer a detailed, considered performance of Brahms’s humanist masterpiece. Tempos are steady and sombre, the playing full of warmth, and there are heartfelt vocal solos from Johanna Wallroth and Brian Mulligan. The tone in the first movement is beautifully dark, the lower strings (the violins are silent in this movement) taking the music down into a velvety blackness, the wind soloists lavishing care on every line. It’s a highly promising start. Yet while the attention to detail continues, so does the carefulness, and the latter is perhaps too dominant. The work’s sense of consolation is captured more convincingly than its suggestion of release: the culmination of

The two sequels <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/23/before-sunset-review">Before Sunset (in 2004)</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/20/before-midnight-review">Before Midnight (in 2013)</a> famously reunited the leads and gave us an episodic study of their growing old as a couple welded together by that amazing moment in Vienna; it was an ambitious approach which Linklater brought to its fullest success with <a href="https:/

## Why do so many people dream of being dog groomers? Haven’t they seen the toll it can take? | Adrian Chiles

<p>Hour after hour of washing, trimming and blow-drying unwilling pups is not my idea of fun – or my dog’s </p><p>Lots of people like the idea of grooming dogs for a living. Some survey sought to identify the most popular jobs to which British workers would like to switch in the coming 12 months, and dog grooming came out top. I can see – or at least used to see – the attraction. Pooch parlours are the most delightful shop windows on any high street. There the dogs stand, big and small, being shorn, snipped, styled and blow-dried for all to see. It’s a charming sight, to be sure. How nice it must be to be the human working in that environment.</p><p>But I strongly suspect that these dreams people are harbouring of getting into dog grooming wouldn’t long survive contact with reality. Take a closer look in the window of your local canine coiffurist. What is that look in those dogs’ eyes? In some, to be fair, I see pure enjoyment as they luxuriate in all the attention, from their stylis

Margot lives with her deranged and embittered mother in an isolated house in the woods, which regularly attracts lost hikers, injured walkers and stranded motorists. The “strays”, as they call them, are then not just murdered but munched. Margot is more familiar with eating human fingers than the fishy variety, and when the alternative is boring pasta, the prospect of a&nbsp;roasted, rosemary-scented rump or thigh is irresistible.</p><p>Margot has known nothing else in her short life: “Mama didn’t feed me from breast or bottle.

If it is the real deal then the Chinese have created a premium-quality AI product that is available freely and at a tiny cost. That’s quite something.

In his spare time he painted Lowry-esque vignettes of working-class life.

As Tucker recalls, it felt “like discovering a vast escape tunnel dug by a prisoner with just a spoon”. In addition to scenes from pubs, theatres and nightclubs, “there were portraits of pigeon fanciers, surreal montages of clowns and carnival workers, pictures of down-and-outs, cabaret turns, Travellers, broad-shouldered housewives in headscarves, and slightly haunting, hobbling children”.</p><p>Tucker, a screenwriter and fellow Warrington native, arranged an exhibition of

<p>One of Ireland’s most important novelists and a woman of fierce intelligence and bravery is celebrated in Sinéad O’Shea’s thoroughly enjoyable documentary</p><p>Sinéad O’Shea’s documentary portrait of the author Edna O’Brien is a reminder that most writers – most people, in fact – don’t have lives anywhere near as exciting or fulfilling as hers. The film, with diary entries read by Jessie Buckley, shows us that O’Brien was always a witty, generous and good-humoured interviewee over the years; this film includes an extended interview with the author herself just before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jul/29/edna-obrien-obituary">her death last year at the age of 93</a>, in which she speaks with a softly sibilant but beautiful voice, her natural prose-poetry never deserting her.</p><p>This film really does have a staggering story to tell. As a young woman in rural Ireland, Edna O’Brien ran away with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/24/biography.ste

<p>There are rational explanations for the continent’s muted response to US threats – but that’s not how you deal with this president</p><p>Donald Trump’s antics over the past week have put paid to the refrain, often heard in Europe, that the president should be taken “seriously but not literally”. It turns out that Trump literally wants Greenland. He doubled down on his aggressive rhetoric in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/25/trump-greenland-denmark">raging 45-minute call</a> with the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, a few days ago, threatening crippling tariffs unless she agreed to sell the autonomous territory to the US. In response to Denmark’s sharp increase in military spending for the Arctic, including ships and drones, he derided Copenhagen’s “dog-sled” defences for Greenland, the world’s largest non-continental island, which pale in comparison with the strength of the US military base there.</p><p>The threat to take over the territory of a Eur

What an absurd idea.</p><p>An hour ago, I was inside a tiny mountain refuge beside Lac Robert drinking tea, the temperature outside dropping by the second.
