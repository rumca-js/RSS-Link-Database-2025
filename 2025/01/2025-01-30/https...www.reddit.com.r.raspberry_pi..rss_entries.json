Or if someone would kindly test this out by removing their M.2 and seeing if the Pi detects it.

I&#39;m running a script that involves using a neopixel, an SSD1306 OLED display, and the adafruit stereo bonnet.</p> <p>Neopixels require sudo to work properly. so I&#39;m running the script as sudo. THe problem i&#39;ve discovered is that when I try to use basically anything ALSA related when running sudo commands, i&#39;m getting the following error:</p> <p><code>ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:999:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave</code></p> <p>I know it&#39;s typically best to run without sudo when possible, but I can&#39;t find anything from neopixels that allows me to run it without. So that leaves me with trying to figure out a fix for this odd problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Deuceman927\"> /u/Deuceman927 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1id9koy/rpi_zero_2_wadafruit_stereo_bonnetneopixel_ring/\">[link]</a",
