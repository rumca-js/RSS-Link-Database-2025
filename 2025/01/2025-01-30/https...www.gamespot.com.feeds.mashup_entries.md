<p>In 1989, the original Kickboxer martial arts movie helped establish Jean-Claude Van Damme as an action star. Now, for the first time ever, the Kickboxer franchise is making the leap to video games with Force Multiplier Studios, a team of developers with experience on Call of Duty, Borderlands, Halo, Tomb Raider, and Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Screenwriter Dimitri Logothetis and producer Rob Hickman--two of the filmmakers behind the 2016 film Kickboxer: Vengeance and its sequel, Kickboxer: Retaliation--are working with Force Multiplier Studios to bring the Kickboxer video game to life. But for now, the game is at such an early stage of development that there's nothing to show off.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-devs-are-making-the-first-ever-official-kickboxer-video-game-but-is-jean-claude-van-damme-in-it">IGN</a>, Force Multiplier Studios was very vague about whether Van Damme will lend his likeness to the game or participate in any w

<p>New Presidential administrations almost always mean a new agenda for the Federal Communications Commission. As a prime example of this, the new FCC Chair Brendan Carr has struck down a Biden-era proposal that would have limited landlords' ability to make tenants accept mandatory internet service through a single bulk provider. Since the proposal has been shot down, there's nothing keeping building owners from forcing their tenants to pay for internet service they neither want nor need.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/fcc-chair-nixes-plan-to-boost-broadband-competition-in-apartment-buildings/">Ars Technica</a>, Carr framed his decision as a win for consumers and claimed that the previous proposal would have increased increased internet costs for tenants. He also condemned the proposal as "regulatory overreach" and promised to undo more of the FCC's prior agenda.</p><p>However, the now-defunct proposal was not a ban on landlords' ability to

<p dir="ltr">Eternal Strands weaves together a deeply intriguing scene from its earliest moments, stitching together a picture of a fantasy world built around the concept of magic emulating threads. It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel.</p><p dir="ltr">Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk ab
