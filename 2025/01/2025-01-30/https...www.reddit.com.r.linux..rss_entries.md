Want to install Linux packages? Easy. Want to access your Windows files? No problem. Want to spin up a development environment without dual-booting or running a VM? Chef’s kiss.</p> <p>But then, in my infinite wisdom, I thought: <em>&quot;Hey, let’s access a USB drive.&quot;</em></p> <p>Oh. Oh no.</p> <p>I naively assumed I could just plug in my flash drive and, I don’t know… mount it? <em>Like a normal person?</em> But no, WSL looked at me like I had just asked it to solve world hunger.</p> <p>A quick dig around, and apparently, if you want WSL to see your USB device, you might need to:</p> <ol> <li>Jump through a series of PowerShell commands.</li> <li>
