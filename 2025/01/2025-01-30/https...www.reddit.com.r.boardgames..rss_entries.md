<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been playing the digital version of Scout, and one of the achievements is to score 20 points in a single round. </p> <p>Has anyone managed to do this? This seems very hard to do. I think my highest score has been 14 points (at 3 players), but on average I can manage about 10 points. Granted, I’ve only been playing against CPU so far, but it seems pretty hard to pull off. I feel like maybe I’m missing a strategy here. Is it the player count?

For example, strategies for worker placement/engine building in a Euro. Or what about deck builders as another example?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those of you who have played the Cultist Simulator videogame, is there anything remotely close to that in feel and game structure which exists in boardgame form? </p> <p>I did see a thread focused on &quot;cult&quot; themes, but that wasn&#39;t exactly the right fit in terms of mood + card play. Maybe Eschaton, a bit? Evenfall also caught my eye, but that&#39;s not exactly as dark. </p> <p>Honestly no clue if anything exists along these lines, but I&#39;d love to hear about boardgames which might be close! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/o0Valadar0o"> /u/o0Valadar0o </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1idd5rd/cultist_simulator_anything_comparable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1idd5rd/cultist_simulator_anything_comparable/">[comments]</a></span>

## Board game newbie over here, me and my friends have only played Catan for years and only recently started playing Wingspan, and now we'd like to jump in the world of Dune Imperium. We'd like to avoid expansions. Should we go for DI or DI:U for better and smoother experience?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Our Kickstarter containing Everdell: Duo and My First Everdell arrived last week. We played a game of My First Everdell with our 5yo and I thought I would share a quick review.</p> <p>***This review is not sponsored by anyone and we payed fully for everything***</p> <p>TLDR; Great adaptation of Everdell for younger players, but also people that prefer simpler boardgames tthan Everdell. Highly recommend to families and people less in the hobby.</p> <p>The longer review:</p> <p>We play a lot of boardgames with our kids, so we got it down now. First, unpacking the game is an activity in itself. There is a decent amount of unwrapping and punching parts, so it took about 20minutes and we called it a day. It would have been faster on our own. We read the rules in advance.</p> <p>Next day, game setup. The design and graphics are very pretty. Slightly different than the original, but still very cute. However, it is not childish.
