Scientists have achieved a major milestone by creating a bi-paternal mouse, marking progress in stem cell science and reproductive biology. By modifying imprinting genes, researchers overcame previous barriers to unisexual mammalian reproduction. While only a small percentage of the engineered embryos survived to birth, the research demonstrates the potential for advancing regenerative medicine and cloning technologies. Despite challenges such as developmental abnormalities and sterility, the study opens doors for future applications in stem cell therapies and larger mammalian models.

A mysterious interstellar object, estimated to be eight times the mass of Jupiter, may have significantly altered the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune billions of years ago. A study suggests that this body passed remarkably close to the Sun, potentially influencing planetary trajectories. Simulations conducted by researchers indicate that a single close encounter could explain current orbital irregularities. The findings, yet to be peer-reviewed, highlight how interstellar objects might have played a role in shaping the solar system’s structure.

NASA’s SPHEREx mission, set to launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on February 27, aims to explore the origins of the universe and the formation of galaxies. Using near-infrared light, the telescope will study over 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars in the Milky Way. It will also search for water and organic molecules in regions where stars and planets form. Managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the mission is expected to provide transformative insights into cosmic history and life’s essential ingredients. Data collected will be made publicly available through Caltech’s IPAC, enabling researchers worldwide to delve into these discoveries. The SPHEREx observatory represents a significant step in our quest to understand the universe’s mysteries.

A breakthrough study has revealed new insights into the "dark universe," which consists of dark matter and dark energy. By using a novel technique called field-level inference (FLI), scientists have discovered previously hidden details in 3D galaxy maps. This method preserves the three-dimensional nature of the data, unlike traditional compression techniques. The research suggests that vital cosmic information has been overlooked until now. Future studies using real data from advanced space observatories could further enhance our understanding of the universe’s hidden forces.

Blue Origin’s New Shepard NS-29 mission, scheduled for Jan. 28, 2025, will simulate lunar gravity during its suborbital flight. The uncrewed mission, launching from West Texas, carries 30 experiments, with 17 contributed by NASA. These experiments aim to advance lunar exploration technologies, including studying moon dust behaviour, fire dynamics in low gravity, and geomechanical testing. During the flight, the capsule will spin at 11 revolutions per minute, creating two minutes of simulated lunar gravity. This is part of ongoing efforts to support NASA's Artemis programme, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon by 2027. The booster and capsule will separately return to Earth, completing the mission in approximately 11 minutes.

## Neanderthal Blood Protein Incompatibilities May Have Contributed to Extinction

Research indicates that genetic differences in Neanderthal blood proteins may have played a role in their extinction. Scientists discovered that Neanderthals had a rare RhD blood type, which was incompatible with the blood types of Denisovans and Homo sapiens. This incompatibility could have led to hemolytic disease in mixed-species offspring, resulting in severe health problems that hindered their ability to survive and reproduce. Combined with environmental challenges and competition with modern humans, these genetic factors may have contributed to the gradual decline of Neanderthal populations.

The Bayeux Tapestry, an extraordinary 11th-century embroidery, vividly portrays William the Conqueror's victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and the death of King Harold. Spanning 230 feet in length, this detailed masterpiece consists of 58 scenes embroidered with wool, depicting significant historical moments, including Halley's Comet and Harold's oath on saintly relics. Likely commissioned by Bishop Odo, a close associate of William, it provides a visual account of medieval weaponry, clothing, and architecture. Missing panels are believed to have shown William’s coronation as King of England. Preserved over centuries, it remains an essential historical artefact. A new museum dedicated to showcasing the tapestry is set to open in 2027, while it can currently be viewed online.
