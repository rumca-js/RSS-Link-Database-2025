The first PMJ video of the year is here! Meet Nathan Chester — an electrifying performer (and a recent finalist on ‘The Voice’) who is bringing the Old School sounds of soul into the present day.  For his PMJ debut, we reimagined Shaboozey’s chart-topping hit of 2024 as a chart-topping hit from 1962.  Everybody at the bar gettin' twist-y!
