<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there! I have been looking for 4:3 monitors for a few months, and I found a seller in my country that has a used NEC 2090uxi (20&quot;, 1600x1200) for 50 USD. I would like to know if it would be a good monitor for occasional gaming, and also for general use as a secondary monitor (web browsing, editing documents in word, excel, watching youtube videos or old 4:3 shows/films). I´ve read that it was launched as a monitor oriented towards people who work with graphics so I am not sure if there are any drawbacks to consider for the use cases I mentioned before. I would appreciate it if anyone could share their experiences or recommendations regarding the 2090uxi.

Please explain to me like I&#39;m 5 (or dumb). </p> <p>My wife and I are moving into a house that will have enough space for me to finally create a place to play my favorite childhood games (and the ones I never got but always wanted!!). I want to be able to play n64, ps2, 360, and my ps5. </p> <p>Now, from what I understand, the best way to play the 64 and ps2 will be on a crt. But then people start tossing around terms like rgb mod, hdmi mod, upscaling, aspect ratios, etc. and i just cant seem to follow. Basically, what I&#39;m after is playing the original consoles and games at or near what they were back in the 2000s. I understand I can get an adapter that goes from av to hdmi but it will hinder the input lag and sometimes make the picture look dark or zoomed in? (Is that accurate?) </p> <p>Would something like a retrotink be a simple plug and play? Or do I need to buy other supporting components for it? <
