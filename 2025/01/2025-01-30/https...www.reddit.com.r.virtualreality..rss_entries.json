So I want to know\u2014what are the most modern, best options for VR?</p> <p>Some caveats: \u2022 Tracking quality: I\u2019m mainly looking for tracking options that are on par with base stations. I get motion sick easily, so anything even slightly worse is out of the question. \u2022 No Meta/Oculus: I dislike them and everything they stand for. \u2022 Limited hands-on experience: I live in an area where I can\u2019t try different headsets. The only one I\u2019ve had the chance to test (at a friend\u2019s house) is the Index.</p> <p>Is the Index still the gold standard in 2025?</p> <p>Is there still nothing that beats it in overall quality?</p> <p>Since I\u2019ve tried the Index: Pros: \u2714\ufe0f FoV is great \u2714\ufe0f Screen door effect is basically gone \u2714\ufe0f Joysticks are great \u2714\ufe0f Comin",

So I&#39;m in my last semester of a network administration degree and I&#39;m doing a capstone project (semester long project) on ways VR/AR are used in I.T. The goal of the project is to be about ways it can help in I.T. if at all. I&#39;m avoiding it&#39;s application to education since that&#39;s fairly well known and focusing on actual utilities of it. So far I&#39;ve come across a couple of apps on the quest store for tracking wifi strength, for virtual office spaces, and planning network racks. But I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s anything that any of you use or might know of in the utilities side of VR/AR that i could look into, unfortunately so far all my researching keeps bringing up games and education, and I want practical office uses and more I.T. related uses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bbt104\"> /u/bbt104 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualr",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I spent a couple months learning Blender and Unity to try and recreate an old PlayStation arcade compilation game that works with PCVR. That got me thinking: is there any legitimate retro game compilations available for any VR headsets? I&#39;m referring to a title made exclusively for VR that is being sold by a company with recognizable games from old systems. </p> <p>The only game that came to mind was SEGA Mega Drive &amp; Genesis Collection, but that&#39;s unfortunately been delisted last year. There is emulator software such as EmuVR , AGE of Joy, and Arcade Time Capsule, but these require bringing your own game to play. </p> <p>Would old retro games be something VR users be interested in playing if made officially? Also would it be enough to just include a bunch of games, or would there need to be more to justify the price?</p> <p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1id91m6/video/97kta1yyq0ge1/player\">Anyone remember the Namco Museum?</a></p> </di",
