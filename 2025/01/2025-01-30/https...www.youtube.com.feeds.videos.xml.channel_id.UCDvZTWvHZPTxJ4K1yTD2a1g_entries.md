Step aside Wish, Games Workshop, Army Painter and Temu because today we're getting the Warhammer scams straight from Green Stuff World. Will they deliver or will they forever be labeled as scam artists? 

We don't actually think any one of these products from Green Stuff World, Army Painter or Games Workshop are real scams, we're grading the product on a "scam" scale. High points = less bang for buck product.
