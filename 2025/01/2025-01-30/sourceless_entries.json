        "description": "The yen made broad gains on Thursday as Japan looks on track to keep raising interest rates while others cut, with the European Central Bank seen certain to deliver the latest in a series of policy easings later in the day.  The yen was the notable mover in currency markets, with the dollar down 0.6% to 154.35 yen and the euro falling a similar amount to 160.62 yen.  Markets are more than fully priced for the ECB to trim rates by 25 basis points to 2.75% later on Thursday, with even a small chance of a 50 basis points reduction given the weakness of the euro zone economy.",

Tesla said on Wednesday it expected the vehicle business to return to growth this year, but did not repeat Musk's prediction from late last year that sales would grow 20% to 30% in 2025.  Tesla shares have rallied recently on hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump, whose election campaign Musk had backed with around a quarter-billion dollars in donations, would provide a clearer regulatory path for its robotaxis.",

        "description": "The European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected on Thursday and kept more easing on the table, sticking to its view that inflation in the euro zone is increasingly under control despite concerns about global trade.  The fifth ECB rate cut since June, which had been well telegraphed to the market, lowered the rate that the central bank pays on deposits to 2.75% from 3.0%.  The euro zone economy has remained weak, despite some signs of revival in the latest round of surveys, and inflation has hovered just above the ECB's 2% target, cementing the case for Thursday's rate cut.",

Investors do not expect more sovereign defaults in 2025, but credit metrics for smaller and riskier countries, known as frontier markets, point to a structural weakening, especially for governments in Africa, Thomas Lambert, of Lazard's sovereign advisory team, said.  Markets expect it to be steady until June as Donald Trump's second administration has left the policy backdrop extremely uncertain.",

        "description": "Swedish fast-fashion retailer H&M is working to buy more of its clothes and accessories from suppliers closer to its key markets in Europe and the U.S., its finance chief told Reuters on Thursday, in part to prepare for potential U.S. import tariffs.  \"For many reasons we need to create a more regionalised supply chain, both for geopolitical reasons, learning through COVID that we need to create more resilience in our supply chain, and also to support responsiveness and the customer offer,\" Adam Karlsson said in an interview after H&M's quarterly results.  Potential U.S. tariffs on imports are also pushing H&M to seek suppliers closer to its U.S. market, Karlsson said, adding that the retailer had drawn up scenarios for such trade barriers, which he called a \"concern\".",

        "description": "The chemical industry has also been struggling with sluggish demand recovery, resulting in lower prices, particularly in Europe due to a challenging regulatory landscape which has caused firms to reassess their strategies.  However, the Ohio-based company posted an adjusted profit of $2.09 per share for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating estimates of $2.06 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG, as it benefited from higher sales at its paint stores unit.  The company expects full-year adjusted profit in the range of $11.65 per share to $12.05 per share, far below Wall Street expectations of $12.60 per share.",

The oil major also announced a $3.5 billion share buyback for the current quarter, making this the 13th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion of share repurchases.  Its shares gained 1% even as the group reported that its 2024 adjusted earnings, its definition of net profit, fell to $23.72 billion from $28.25 billion in 2023, dented by narrower liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading margins, lower oil and gas prices, and weaker refining margins.",

That's a change from last year where the global consensus was for cautious rate cuts, with seven of the world's 10 major, developed-market central banks easing policy.  The Swiss National Bank has been at the forefront of monetary easing and, in 2024, took its benchmark rate from 1.75% down to 0.5%.",
