By modifying imprinting genes, researchers overcame previous barriers to unisexual mammalian reproduction. While only a small percentage of the engineered embryos survived to birth, the research demonstrates the potential for advancing regenerative medicine and cloning technologies. Despite challenges such as developmental abnormalities and sterility, the study opens doors for future applications in stem cell therapies and larger mammalian models.",

A study suggests that this body passed remarkably close to the Sun, potentially influencing planetary trajectories. Simulations conducted by researchers indicate that a single close encounter could explain current orbital irregularities. The findings, yet to be peer-reviewed, highlight how interstellar objects might have played a role in shaping the solar system\u2019s structure.",

These experiments aim to advance lunar exploration technologies, including studying moon dust behaviour, fire dynamics in low gravity, and geomechanical testing. During the flight, the capsule will spin at 11 revolutions per minute, creating two minutes of simulated lunar gravity. This is part of ongoing efforts to support NASA's Artemis programme, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon by 2027. The booster and capsule will separately return to Earth, completing the mission in approximately 11 minutes.",

Scientists discovered that Neanderthals had a rare RhD blood type, which was incompatible with the blood types of Denisovans and Homo sapiens. This incompatibility could have led to hemolytic disease in mixed-species offspring, resulting in severe health problems that hindered their ability to survive and reproduce. Combined with environmental challenges and competition with modern humans, these genetic factors may have contributed to the gradual decline of Neanderthal populations.",

Likely commissioned by Bishop Odo, a close associate of William, it provides a visual account of medieval weaponry, clothing, and architecture. Missing panels are believed to have shown William\u2019s coronation as King of England. Preserved over centuries, it remains an essential historical artefact.
