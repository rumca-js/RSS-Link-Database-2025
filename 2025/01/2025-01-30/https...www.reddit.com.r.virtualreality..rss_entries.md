One thing that was really hard for me to get past, was the inability to get a correct focus for the lenses, and the white on black brightness haloing and refractions/reflections.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This game is so polished with super full, lush environments, each one different and large, but it&#39;s missing motion controls. No controls, then it&#39;s not true VR, right?</p> <p>Yet, I have to tell you guys, graphically this game is about as good as it gets. Imagining this game with a vr version makes you realize what pcvr could be, and it&#39;s not hard to do.</p> <p>The game seems like it was built as a vr game and when you&#39;re just walking with the joy stick it&#39;s easy to forget it isn&#39;t. The point of view is made for vr, it loads into VR easily with the mod and looks amazing. Frankly, if you play this game on a flat screen, you&#39;re missing out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jokong"> /u/Jokong </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1idbbne/indiana_jones_vr_is_what_pcvr_could_be/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

## VR/AR for I.T. work?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello VR people! So I&#39;m in my last semester of a network administration degree and I&#39;m doing a capstone project (semester long project) on ways VR/AR are used in I.T. The goal of the project is to be about ways it can help in I.T. if at all. I&#39;m avoiding it&#39;s application to education since that&#39;s fairly well known and focusing on actual utilities of it. So far I&#39;ve come across a couple of apps on the quest store for tracking wifi strength, for virtual office spaces, and planning network racks. But I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s anything that any of you use or might know of in the utilities side of VR/AR that i could look into, unfortunately so far all my researching keeps bringing up games and education, and I want practical office uses and more I.T. related uses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bbt104"> /u/bbt104 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualr

## Thoughts on retro games compilations and VR - is there a demand for it?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I spent a couple months learning Blender and Unity to try and recreate an old PlayStation arcade compilation game that works with PCVR. That got me thinking: is there any legitimate retro game compilations available for any VR headsets? I&#39;m referring to a title made exclusively for VR that is being sold by a company with recognizable games from old systems. </p> <p>The only game that came to mind was SEGA Mega Drive &amp; Genesis Collection, but that&#39;s unfortunately been delisted last year. There is emulator software such as EmuVR , AGE of Joy, and Arcade Time Capsule, but these require bringing your own game to play. </p> <p>Would old retro games be something VR users be interested in playing if made officially? Also would it be enough to just include a bunch of games, or would there need to be more to justify the price?</p> <p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/1id91m6/video/97kta1yyq0ge1/player">Anyone remember the Namco Museum?</a></p> </di
