<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the massive growth of the Usenet feed, it’s understandable that Usenet servers are struggling to keep up with storing it. I’m curious are there any tools or methods to reliably measure the actual number of Usenet posts available across different providers? </p> <p>For example, if a server claims &quot;4500 days of retention&quot; how can we see how many posts are actually accessible over that period? Or better yet, is there a way to compare how many posts are available for varying retention periods across all providers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/External_Bend4014"> /u/External_Bend4014 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1idmxjq/how_to_measure_retention_across_providers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1idmxjq/how_to_measure_retention_across_providers/">[comments]</a></span>
