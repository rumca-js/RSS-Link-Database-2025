<p>Onyx Storm is the third instalment out of five expected novels in Rebecca Yarros&#8217; The Empyrean Series. It has taken the world by storm (if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun) with midnight releases, special editions reselling for massive amounts, and flying into the top spot on almost every book-selling chart. While I love dragons, and I probably would have got to this series eventually because of that, it wasn&#8217;t very high on my books-to-buy list. I only bought Fourth Wing after GdM team member Sally reviewed it. In her words, &#8216;high literature it is not, but it&#8217;s still the best book I&#8217;ve read all year.&#8217; So, I started the first of The Empyrean Series over the Christmas Break of 2023 with no expectations other than there being dragons and a bit of fun â€“ and promptly read both Fourth Wing and the second in the series Iron Flame in less than a week. Here we are just over a year later, and with the release of Onyx Storm, I probably should have done a reread
