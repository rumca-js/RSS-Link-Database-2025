Sniper Elite: Resistance is OUT NOW on Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC!

In a gripping new story that runs parallel with Sniper Elite 5, Harry Hawker, agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), takes the lead for the first time as he discovers an insidious new Wunderwaffe - something so powerful, it guarantees the Nazis will win the war.

Offering unparalleled sniping mechanics, stealth and tactical third-person combat, Sniper Elite: Resistance turns the attention of the award-winning series towards a hidden war, far from the front lines, deep within the heart of occupied France.

Working with the French Resistance, this deadly addition to the Reich's arsenal must be eliminated.

Multiple Kill List targets, and different infiltration and extraction points give you an unequalled choice with how to accomplish objectives and create your own playstyle.

The full campaign can also be experienced in co-op. Fight against the Nazi war machine with an ally to share
