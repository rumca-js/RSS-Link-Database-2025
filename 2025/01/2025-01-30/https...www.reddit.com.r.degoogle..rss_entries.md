<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am beyond stumped. RCS turned off before I moved away from Google Messages. Rebooted the phone. MMS doesn&#39;t work sending to all contacts. Weird thing? I can&#39;t find a correlation. Different providers, some on Android, some on iOS, some updated and using RCS, some not. No rhyme or reason.</p> <p>I am on a Samsung Galaxy S22+ on Verizon. I&#39;m in the baby stages of degoogling.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KungPaoKidden"> /u/KungPaoKidden </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1idwi1b/heliboard_quik_sms_mms_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1idwi1b/heliboard_quik_sms_mms_issues/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a degoogled LineageOS, I&#39;m not in any social medias except Reddit and WhatsApp and many other stuff, I have degoogled, deMicrosoft too. But all of a sudden, every person I meet and my old friends says, <em>nah, we use Instagram, come join</em> and I am like, <em>(#&lt;_6kidf63ozn){#7l{|×¢6i38r7djskdnx</em>. When there&#39;s some emergency, trying to install Uber/Ola from PlayStore, needs Google Play Services, MicroG doesn&#39;t work, when want to visit somewhere, Organic maps doesn&#39;t work properly, it bugs. Takes 20 minutes to get my location, then download it, and etc. It&#39;s more depressing then like, <em>end in relationship with girl/boy</em>. Idk wtf is happening like what? I don&#39;t want to connect to Google again, but leaves me configured on my phone for everything. If I&#39;ll do everything into my phone, giving the whole time, how am I supposed to outside the mobile and touch grass. Very complex. Even after meeting Linux us

I&#39;m updating Cromite and had these package options. I chose the top one, as it was selected, and I think it&#39;s the one I used last time. Not so much concerned with the webview options, I&#39;m mostly wondering what the difference is between the one that&#39;s selected and the bottom one that is labeled vanilla Chromium. If I chose that, would it replace Cromite with just regular Chromium?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/golffan2020"> /u/golffan2020 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/cj41wm5h22ge1.jpeg">[link]</a></spa

## Search engine with absolutely no AI??

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, so. Absolutely a newbie to everything de-googling. I...still use a lot of google products, really. (Hard to move everything over all at once, but hey, gotta get started somehow.)</p> <p>For now, I want a search engine with zero Gen-AI/LLMs. I&#39;m currently using duckduckgo with every single AI feature disabled, but I&#39;d like to know if there&#39;s an engine out there that straight up doesn&#39;t have them built in at all. I want to support and use an engine for making what I believe to be a moral choice in using zero Gen-AI.</p> <p>I tried looking around, but Ecosia has an AI chatbot, as does Duckduckgo. I heard Kagi being named a lot, but they seem to have AI features now too. Qwant also uses AI, from what I&#39;ve seen. </p> <p>As someone who is rather environment-anxious and a creative, I just CAN&#39;T in good conscience stand behind any company using Gen-AI, so I&#39;d really really prefer it if I could get an engine with none of that
