He was an unlikely saviour but Ange Postecoglou was not complaining. There was more joy when another substitute, the 19-year-old winger, Oyindamola Ajayi, came on to score on his debut, then when Mikey Moore made it 3-0 with his first professional goal. Spurs had secured their place in the knockout phase. There was relief at avoiding two extra playoff games.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/30/tottenham-elfsborg-europa-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

David Beckham, who turns 50 this year, has released pictures of himself modelling his new bodywear collection for Hugo Boss. Bodywear, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term, appears to mean underwear. In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmB02oWLPiU\">corresponding ad clip</a>, Beckham returns home for the day in his vintage Aston Martin, Bond-style, but he can\u2019t wait to rip off his sharp suit and slouch around in a leather armchair in nothing but his tighty-whities. He has set the bar very high for middle-aged dads who like to relax by sitting around drinking in their pants, Homer Simpson-style. If you feel at all self-conscious about your soft, squishy, beer-induced centre, Beckham\u2019s new line of smalls will not help.</p><p>In recent years, the dad bod seemed to be on the verge of widespread public acceptanc",

The only question is why he didn\u2019t get round to it sooner. Written in 1936 but little-known now, the concerto is a giant, Technicolor work that\u2019s a great fit both for Thibaudet\u2019s flamboyant yet precise playing style and for the LA Philharmonic and their conductor Gustavo Dudamel. Khachaturian, born in Georgia into an Armenian family, was a composer with one foot in Soviet Russia and one in the Caucasus, and that comes through in music that\u2019s a distinctive, inseparable mixture of Russian popular Romanticism with eastern modes and harmonies.

Tempos are steady and sombre, the playing full of warmth, and there are heartfelt vocal solos from Johanna Wallroth and Brian Mulligan. The tone in the first movement is beautifully dark, the lower strings (the violins are silent in this movement) taking the music down into a velvety blackness, the wind soloists lavishing care on every line. It\u2019s a highly promising start. Yet while the attention to detail continues, so does the carefulness, and the latter is perhaps too dominant. The work\u2019s sense of consolation is captured more convincingly than its suggestion of release: the culmination of",

However, the film is shaping up to be a critical and commercial flop \u2013 maybe even the biggest Marvel flop yet \u2013 and so it makes sense that Ford would want to quickly move on to his next project.</p><p>And now we know what that project is. This week a number of videos appeared on the YouTube channel of the Scottish whisky brand Glenmorangie, taking the form of a semi-fictional six-part series about the adventures of Harrison Ford in Scotland. Joel Edgerton directed the adverts. They\u2019re set in the Traitors castle. It\u2019s all quite hard to comprehend.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/30/harriso",

The arrival of a budget Chinese chatbot called DeepSeek to rival ChatGPT really is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/28/donald-trump-china-deepseek-ai-chatbot-shares\">wake-up call</a>. It is a wake-up call to the US tech giants. It is a wake-up call to Wall Street. It is a wake-up call to any developed nation keen to enter the AI race.</p><p>All of that is true even if it turns out that DeepSeek is not all it is cracked up to be. If it is the real deal then the Chinese have created a premium-quality AI product that is available freely and at a tiny cost. That\u2019s quite something. In 1957, the US was stunned when the Soviet Union became the first country to launch an artificial satellite. It has been equally taken aback by the arrival of DeepSeek. Truly this would be a Sputnik moment.</p><p>Larry Elli",

But it is not a sufficient condition for growth. Boosting foreign trade is important, but to discuss it without reference to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/23/it-was-a-nightmare-it-still-is-the-cost-of-doing-business-eight-years-after-brexit\">European single market</a> is disingenuous. If fiscal responsibility is a goal then it should be achieved by ways other than cutting social spending.</p><p>But, economics aside, the cumulative effect of those omissions makes the chancellor\u2019s speech sound desperate and shallow. That doesn\u2019t mean the Treasury\u2019s plan is doomed",
