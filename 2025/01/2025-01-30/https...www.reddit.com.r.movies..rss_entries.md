These are almost all 10/10 reviews and about 50+ of these on this day. This is not typical compared to the other reviews, where are spread out by a couple of days to even weeks. </p> <p>The reviews seen to have 3 thumbs ups and a single thumbs down.</p> <p>It&#39;s sus considering how the movie isn&#39;t recent.

I always thought he made that prayer up. This is one of my favorite movies that I re watch on the regular and I never noticed this or even knew this was a song nonetheless a real song from an actual band from the 70s!

I also don&#39;t mind the shakycam in those movies too as at least you can focus on what&#39;s going on in those scenes.</p> <p>But one thing I will say is how it kickstarted shaky cam in action movies for the worse.

But for a while, shaky cam in action movies were a huge trend around H
