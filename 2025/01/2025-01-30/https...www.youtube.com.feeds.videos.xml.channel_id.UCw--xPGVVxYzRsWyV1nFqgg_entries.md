What does your favorite author say about you? ðŸ“–âœ¨ In this episode, weâ€™re diving deep into the hidden truths behind your favorite writersâ€”whether youâ€™re a Tolkien purist, a Sanderson speed-reader, or a MiÃ©ville mega-fan. From the epic worldbuilders to the grimdark nihilists, Iâ€™ll be breaking down what your choice of author reveals about your taste, personality, and reading habits. Do you crave meticulously built magic systems, morally gray characters, or prose so dense it doubles as a doorstop? Letâ€™s find out!
