        "description": "Citizen Sleeper crept up out of nowhere in 2022, but was instantly lauded by those who played it as one of the most unique and compelling games of the year. Now, developer indie developer Jump Over the Age is out with a sequel, and by no means has it suffered a sophomore slump. \n\nOn the contrary, in fact, Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is an absolute triumph that manages to improve even upon its fantastic predecessor in nearly every way that matters. \n\nOnce again, Citizen Sleeper 2 boasts stellar writing and worldbuilding in one of the most captivating sci-fi settings in recent gaming memory, while also touting some of the most dangerously addictive and mechanically engaging gameplay choice-driven gameplay.",
