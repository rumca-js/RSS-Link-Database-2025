Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector reviewed by Jarrett Green on PC, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging.

Assetto Corsa Evo Early Access reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. 

"Assetto Corsa Evo already feels absolutely fantastic behind the wheel but, with aggravating AI opponents slamming into you every which way and hamstrung as it is by online-only features that are currently inaccessible, it doesn’t feel like an essential early access purchase. The handling may be excellent, but I’ll be parking it up and waiting for the finished product – including the promised epic-sized map of Germany – before I put the keys back in the ignition."
