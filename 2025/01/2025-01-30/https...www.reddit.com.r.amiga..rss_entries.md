<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;m really new to this so please bear with me. I really want to make art using Amiga programs, I&#39;m currently running Amiga 500 through the FS-UAE Launcher and I have both Deluxe Paint and Graphicraft download (and the kickstarters.) but, I&#39;m stuck.</p> <p>I want to import an IFF file image into DP, I know I need to convert it to an ADF but I&#39;m not sure what application to use to do this. I&#39;ve looked for a compatible download yet have been unable to find one, if anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. (where can I download disk master 2.5?)</p> <p>Also, I&#39;m slightly confused about how I would upload the file to DP once its converted to ADF but, I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I get there.</p> <p>Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sophialalalala"> /u/sophialalalala </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1idtaqo/mac_co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a Roctec RF-332C which struggles to write to disks. It can read fine, but more often than now, when trying to write, it&#39;ll corrupt the entire disk instead. Although, <em>sometimes</em> it writes just fine.
