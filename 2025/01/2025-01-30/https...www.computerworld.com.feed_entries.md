<p>Chinese start-up DeepSeek’s cost-saving techniques for training and delivering generative AI (genAI) models could democratize the entire industry by lowering entry barriers for new AI companies.</p>



<p>DeepSeek <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3810766/deepseek-triggers-shock-waves-for-ai-giants-but-the-disruption-wont-last.html">made waves this week</a> as its chatbot overtook ChatGPT downloads on the Apple and Google App Stores. The open-source AI model’s impact lies in matching leading US models’ performance at a fraction of the cost by using compute and memory resources more efficiently.</p>



<p>DeepSeek is more than China’s “ChatGPT”; it’s a major step forward for global

<p>China’s Alibaba Group has launched an upgraded version of its Qwen 2.5 AI model, claiming it outperforms models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta, as competition in the AI market intensifies.</p>



<p>“Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms … almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B,” Alibaba’s cloud unit said on its WeChat account, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/alibaba-releases-ai-model-it-claims-surpasses-deepseek-v3-2025-01-29/">Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>On its <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/">GitHub page</a>, the company showed benchmarking results indicating that its instruct models – designed for tasks like chat an

<p>Despite initiating a probe into Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, Microsoft has added the startup’s latest reasoning model R1, to its model catalog on Azure AI Foundry and GitHub.</p>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deepseek-r1-is-now-available-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-github/">blog post</a> in which Microsoft declared that it has added R1, it said that the model had “undergone rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations, including automated assessments of model behavior and extensive security reviews to mitigate potential risks.”</p>
