<p>Microsoft has taken the hot new AI model, DeepSeek, and made it available for Copilot+ PCs — and on the NPU, no less.</p>



<p>If it seems like every other week something important is happening in the AI space — well, that’s not too far from the truth. And while it’s sometimes difficult to tell which developments are the most significant, the recent release of Chinese developer DeepSeek’s model has shaken the AI industry deeply, specifically because the cost to train it was, according to the company, much less than other Western models. That sent American stocks plunging, including those involved in the chip and AI industries.</p>

<p>If you just spent <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">almost $3,000 on a new graphics card,</a> plus several hundred more for a fancy new motherboard to take advantage of it, the last thing you want to hear is that the latter could damage the former. But several users of Asus motherboards with Q-Release Slim PCIe slots <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2588049/asus-q-release-slim-motherboards-can-scratch-gpu-connectors.html">say they’ve scratched their GPUs</a>. And after reviewing the reports, Asus says “there is no need for concern.”</p>



<p>Asus sent PCWorld an extended statement on the situation, affirming that the company is aware of the reports highlighted <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/mainboards/65385-aus-eigener-leidlicher-erfahrung-asus-

<p>Okay, but what does that mean? Well, one of the biggest gains is that ChatGPT will now be better at solving problems in STEM subjects (i.e., science, technology, engineering, math, and programming).

<p>I confess, even as someone who likes to build big number-crunching desktops, that I like sleek and lightweight laptops even more. That’s why the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2567787/asus-takes-on-the-macbook-air-with-the-zenbook-a14.html">Asus Zenbook A14 caught my eye at CES 2025</a>. At less than a kilogram in weight and with 30+ hours of quoted battery life, it’s the platonic ideal of a road warrior notebook. And after a slight delay from its announced date, it’s now available to order from the Asus store.</p>



<p>The Zenbook A14 (model number UX3407) is so named because the lawyers wouldn’t let them call it the “Zenbook Air” for fear of Apple’s litigious wrath, according to the PR team. But you can see the resemblance if you’ve used a MacBook Air before, with its super-skinny and super-light design. At 2.16 pounds and just 0.63 inches thi

<p>You know that beloved VPN app of yours? The one you rely on to secure your internet traffic and keep your data private? It could be a fake.</p>



<p>VPN usage is on the rise across the world as users tune into all the potential benefits, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2453859/heres-why-you-should-be-using-a-vpn-with-your-smart-tv.html">bypassing region locks on streaming content</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2218177/how-to-save-money-with-vpn-benefits-and-risks.html">avoiding price differences based on your location</a>. But with increased popularity comes greater opportunity for exploitation…</p>

<p>At the time, if you were affected, all you could really do was disable Auto HDR and hope for a fix — not an ideal solution, especially if you relied on Auto HDR for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/546269/auto-hdr-deep-dive-how-and-why-to-use-windows-11s-eye-catching-game-feature.html">improved gaming experience it offers</a>.

<p>NordVPN just announced a new protocol called <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/nordwhisper-protocol/">NordWhisper</a>, which is designed specifically to make browsing more accessible by getting around network restrictions. It’ll allow users to overcome advanced network filters that limit traditional VPN connections.</p>



<p>The company explains, “NordWhisper uses web tunnel technology to operate differently from traditional VPN protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard, which can be blocked due to their identifiable traffic patterns. By mimicking regular web traffic, NordWhisper avoids detection by network filters, ensuring reliable access on restricted networks while maintaining strong encryption and security standards.”</p>



<p>Due to the nature of how this new protocol operates, it isn’t expected to win any connection-speed races, but it should provide a

<p>No points for guessing this one in advance. The morning of the official retail launch for Nvidia’s next-gen GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards, they’re almost impossible to actually order at online stores in the United States just an hour after the sales began. Since lines were seen forming days ago at brick-and-mortar retailers, it’s safe to assume a similar situation is in play there.</p>

<p>Microsoft has launched business versions of its Surface Laptop (7th Edition) as well as the Surface Pro (11th Edition) with Intel’s Core Ultra 200 (Lunar Lake) processors inside, offering business customers a choice between x86 and Windows on Arm.</p>



<p>Microsoft also said it will release a version of the Intel-powered Surface Laptop with 5G capabilities later this year. Finally, Microsoft announced a new Surface USB4 Hub, which was designed around the Surface aesthetic but can be used with any laptop with a USB4 port. </p>



<p>Essentially, the new Laptop and Pro are third versions of the latest Surface Pro and Laptop, with similar specs and dimensions.

<p>What do you think of a cute little security camera that can sit inside your living room, be mounted up on your house, or placed pretty much anywhere else you could imagine? And what if that cute little security camera was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tapo-cameras-for-home-security/dp/B0CH45HPZT/">just $25 on Amazon</a>?</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2321243/im-ditching-my-passwords-and-you-should-too.html">I’ve said before</a>, passwords suck. So do made-up holidays, but for Change Your Password Day (which arrives later this week on February 1), it’s a good excuse as any to kick your passwords to the curb.</p>



<p>The point of this celebration? Updating your passwords to be more secure—like finally abandoning <em>password12345</em> (oof) for <em>XSmpJAI5v@NtG-7L#Q2F</em>. Or, if passphrases are more your vibe, <em>Water-Whom-Atom-Flame-Snake5</em>.</p>



<p>But to heck with updating. Go with <em>replacing</em>. Specifically, replacing your passwords with passkeys.</p>



<p>Passkeys don’t require memorization, can be stored directly on your phone, <em>and</em> are stronger than passwords. One particular advantage: They’re phishing-resistant. Separately, i

<p>I’m worried about what that means for the $550 RTX 5070 PC that gamers seemed so jazzed about, and whether the entire RTX 50-series could wind up being a flop if DLSS 4’s fantastic new Multi Frame Generation fails to pick up steam <em>fast</em>.
