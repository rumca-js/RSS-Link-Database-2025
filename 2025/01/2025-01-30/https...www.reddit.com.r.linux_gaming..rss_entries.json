So if developers can&#39;t provide this support because their SteamOS public is limited, it&#39;s something quite natural in fact.

I&#39;ve tried a few distros like Debian, OpenSuse and currently Lubuntu 22 LTS. The latter because it doesn&#39;t use llvmpipe with the i915 driver which kind of increases performance.</p> <p>All of them however have the same problem: When the game uses Direct3D 9 the in-game brightness is unusably dark with much of the screen entirely black. Raising gamma in-game and with xgamma makes the bright spots brighter but the black stays black causing the image to look like a low color bit depth mess. I can&#39;t use DXVK because this chipset doesn&#39;t support Vulkan, so WinD3D/OpenGL it is.</p> <p>With Thief 2 (and T2Fix) I can switch between D3D6 and D3D9, however, the D3D6 version has single digit framerates while the D3D9 is pretty smooth. But you can see the difference:</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n",

I have a pretty low-end hardware (Ryzen 6650U with Radeon 660M iGPU) so running it in native res is clearly not an option for me. And it also changes resolution and refresh rate in the system display settings and does not change it back when the game is closed.</p> <p>So I started looking for the solution, and I found it - gamescope. Unfortunately, it immediately crashes after attempting to launch any game.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the command I used when attempting to launch Stardew Valley (both inside terminal and steam with steam://rungameid/x replaced with %command%):</p> <p><code>gamescope -W 1280 -H 720 -- steam://rungameid/82712<",
