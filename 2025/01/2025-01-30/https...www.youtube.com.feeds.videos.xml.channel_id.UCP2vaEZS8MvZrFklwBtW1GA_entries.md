How to waterproof DITRA Peel and Stick…when toilets overflow it’s disgusting. One way to stop water damage is to waterproof the floor as much as possible. I use prefab KERECK corners and KERDI-BAND against the walls. I also waterproof DITRA seams. Then I silicone the toilet against the tile floor when it’s installed.
