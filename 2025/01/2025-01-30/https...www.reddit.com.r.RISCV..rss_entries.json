The current plan is to explore the Hwacha. But I&#39;d like some suggestions and advice from awesome people on this sr.</p> <p>From my understanding Hwacha is a non-std implementation that is a stepping stone for RVV and they are not compatible. What kind of effort will it take to make Hwacha compatible with RVV so that the compiled binaries for RVV work without much hassel. Is this a good idea? </p> <p>Is there any better alternative for opensource vector co-processors in the wild that use RVV already?</p> <p>Any other links, concerns, comments regarding Hwacha, Vector co-processing in RISC-V is appreciated as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ohisashiburi13\"> /u/ohisashiburi13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1idf9s1/hwacha_vs_rvv_and_vector_coproce",
