This episode was produced in partnership with the Future of Life Institute. If you want to better understand how AI might be dangerous, you can read their recent post explaining why we can't just 'switch off' a dangerous AI at https://futureoflife.org/ai/could-we-switch-off-a-dangerous-ai/.

Artificial Intelligence always takes over humanity in the movies when it gains consciousness. But even without getting into sentience, it's capable of influencing our lives in a lot of ways already.
