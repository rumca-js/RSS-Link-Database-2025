<p>If you don’t have a security camera yet, what are you waiting for? They’re so affordable and easy to set up these days, there’s no reason not to get one — especially when you have options like the Eufy SoloCam S220.</p>



<p>This solar-powered security camera is great for outdoor home surveillance, and right now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Continuous-Resolution-Compatible/dp/B0BZ55JZ4S/">it’s on sale for $69.99 on Amazon</a>. That’s a whopping 46.5 percent off its usual $130 price tag.</p>



<p>All you have to do is find a spot for it, install the mount with a couple of screws, and click the camera into the mount. That’s it! Then you just have to connect it to your home Wi-Fi network for instant access to live video footage and all the other great features it offers.</p>



<p>The most notable thing here is that the Eufy SoloCam S220 ha

<p>Microsoft is taking an aggressive step towards lowering the price of top-tier AI reasoning, placing what appears to be unlimited access to OpenAI’s o1 model directly within Copilot’s new “Think Deeper” feature.</p>



<p>What’s important here is the word “free”: OpenAI released the o1 model in December, and company chief executive Sam Altman promised that it would be the most powerful model available. But it came with a catch: two subscriptions. OpenAI’s ChatGPT Pro charges a whopping $200/mo for unlimited access to the model. The company’s $20/mo service, ChatGPT Plus, also allows access to the o1 model, but with limited access.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft’s chief of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, announced that access to the o1 model would be available to Copilot users <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mustafa-suleyman_today-weve-made-think-

<p>Nope, there’s nothing wrong with your TV—that <em>was </em>an ad you just saw on Amazon Prime Video. </p>



<p>Like many of the big streaming services, Amazon Prime Video has rolled out an ad-supported tier, but it did so a little differently. Rather than raising prices and then giving you the chance to switch to a new, cheaper, “with ads” tier, Amazon added commercials to its standard tier, and you must pay more to turn the ads <em>off</em>. </p>



<p>So, want to get rid of the commercials? Here’s what you do, along with how much it’ll cost you.</p>

<p>To nix the commercial breaks on Amazon Prime Video (well, most of them anyway–more on that in a bit), you’ll need to upgrade your existing Amazon Prime account.</p>

<p>Say what you will about Netflix’s industry practices and mishandling of original content, but you can’t deny that the streaming service has lots of highly bingeable shows still in its library — especially when you use a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2453859/heres-why-you-should-be-using-a-vpn-with-your-smart-tv.html">VPN to access region-locked content from other countries</a>.</p>



<p>Netflix has long offered the ability to download episodes for offline viewing, even on the cheapest “with ads” subscription plan. But what if you want to binge all 180 episodes of <em>Seinfeld</em>? That’s a lot of episodes to download one by one…</p>



<p>Thankfully, Netflix just <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-the-season-download-button">announced in a blog post</a> that the beloved Season Download button, which was previously only avai

<p>For the past five years running, I’ve written an annual check-in on ATSC 3.0 (or “NextGen TV”), the broadcast standard that’s supposed to greatly improve over-the-air TV. Every year, it’s been a story of baby steps.</p>



<p>As 2025 gets underway, that story hasn’t really changed. While ATSC 3.0 is starting to deliver more of what it initially promised—most notably big events in HDR—you might still need to go out of your way to get a compatible TV or external tuner box. ATSC 3.0’s interactive elements remain limited as well, with one promising effort having stalled over the last year. More on that later.</p>



<p>All of which means that the existing ATSC 1.0 standard, which is supported by nearly all televisions today, will stay viable for years to come. The bigger question is whether over-the-air TV will remain viable along with it.</p>

<p>Back in December, Microsoft released an update for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2562586/windows-11-24h2-breaks-audio-and-auto-hdr-update-blocked-on-affected-pcs.html">Windows 11 24H2 that caused issues with Auto HDR</a>, resulting in unexpected behavior ranging from incorrect colors to flat-out system crashes.</p>



<p>At the time, if you were affected, all you could really do was disable Auto HDR and hope for a fix — not an ideal solution, especially if you relied on Auto HDR for the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/546269/auto-hdr-deep-dive-how-and-why-to-use-windows-11s-eye-catching-game-feature.html">improved gaming experience it offers</a>.

<p>Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">GeForce RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2591060/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review.html">RTX 5080</a> are real, and well, they’re not as spectacular as many gamers hoped at first glance – at least when you aren’t using DLSS 4.</p>



<p>I’m worried about what that means for the $550 RTX 5070 PC that gamers seemed so jazzed about, and whether the entire RTX 50-series could wind up being a flop if DLSS 4’s fantastic new Multi Frame Generation fails to pick up steam <em>fast</em>. (It should!) And I have the numbers to back up my fears.</p>
