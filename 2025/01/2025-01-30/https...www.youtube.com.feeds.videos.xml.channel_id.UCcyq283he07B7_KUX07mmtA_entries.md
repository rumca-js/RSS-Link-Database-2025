The world's supply of Brie and Camembert could be in danger. One mold, called Penicillium camemberti, is responsible for the cheeses' iconic white rinds and creamy, tangy centers. But the qualities that once made it a star of the cheese world are becoming a liability — driving some to hunt for colorful fungi in the wild to make completely new cheeses.

## What The Fed's January Announcement Means For Savings Rates | Maximize Your Savings in 2025

Thanks to three rate cuts in the second half of 2024, savings account interest rates have been falling. What does the Fed’s decision in January mean for your savings rates? How can you keep earning money on your cash? 

While the average savings account pays just 0.42% APY, high-yield savings accounts with the best savings account rates right now can earn up to 9 times more interest than a traditional account — up to 4% APY. 

If you’re hoping to lock in your rate before APYs fall further, consider a certificate of deposit (CD). CDs feature fixed interest rates for terms ranging from a few months to several years, shielding you from further rate declines. 

Whether you choose a high-yield savings account or a CD, you’ll earn significantly more interest than the average savings account – no matter what the Fed does next.
