The novel explores themes of family, love, loss, and resilience against the backdrop of India&#39;s social and political transformations.\u201d</p> <p>This was a book where I didn\u2019t hate the characters, but I didn\u2019t love them either. For the majority of the story, I did not feel an emotional connection to the characters. However, there were times when Philipose and Elsie kind of ground my gears. I think they were supposed to be unlikable, people of their time, but it just wasn\u2019t written correctly. However, I did love the characters of Big Ammachi and Baby Mol; some of their scenes were just so wholesome, and you could tell that Big Ammachi was so filled with love. Later in the book, it talks about how she was practically love itself. However, if we have a book that is 700 pages and I don\u2019t feel a connection",

It would be great to build a bigger community to discuss <em>Mrs Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, A Room of One&#39;s Own, Orlando</em>, and other works by this prolific author. This year and the next few years mark the 100th anniversaries of the publications of Woolf&#39;s major works, so I&#39;m very excited to see new editions released and events held to commemorate these seminal contributions to English literature.</p> <p>[Posted with moderator permission.]</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/milly_toons\"> /u/milly_toons </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hyyt31/virginia_woolf_subreddit_is_active_again/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hyyt31/v",
