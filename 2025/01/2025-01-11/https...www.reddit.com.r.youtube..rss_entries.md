<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I completely understand and accept that the adverts allow me to watch content for free. However, my limits have been reached. Starting on the mobile app, often, half the screen is covered by an ad when you launch the app. Not videos, but an ad. Every 2nd or 3rd post on the home screen is an ad. When you play a video, it starts with very long (30s+ of ads) and the whole screen gets taken over. Once you close and skip those - guess what... YouTube does it&#39;s impression of DJ Khaled and drops another one to take over your screen! On the TV it&#39;s not any better, instead of focusing on the content, it&#39;s purely focus on the ads. There are simply too many and it&#39;s annoying. Why are ads shown for apps already on one of my devices? And they&#39;re so repetitive! More importantly - I don&#39;t mind ads, but this has gone TOOO far. Premium is a bit too expensive for me to consider and so it may come down to the fact that I&#39;ll simply stop using

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ben and Anna create incredibly insightful reaction content, but he sometimes struggles with his mental health; they&#39;ve gone on breaks from creating content a few times due to him battling through <a href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxDfx-vkMN6LLZS3iihvuBe7h3LkiMHSXm?si=GROlV9fD5YF7MyP9">bipolar episodes</a> and symptoms. They have now gone about a month without posting, so I just want to know if someone knows if they&#39;re okay. I&#39;m not a patreon subscriber, so afaik they haven&#39;t posted any updates there either. Does anyone have any info? I just hope that they are okay :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CorvusTheCryptid"> /u/CorvusTheCryptid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1hylvgy/does_anyone_know_if_everythings_okay_with_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1hylvgy/does_anyone_know_if_everythings_ok

## Three minutes of Casey Neistat's unreleased David Dobrik documentary was recently uploaded to YouTube. Based on this clip it seems like the doc might contain lots of things that put David in a very bad light that haven't been seen by the public before. Shame on Casey for not releasing it.

## This channel that is VERY clearly targeted towards kids needs to be banned. This is literal gore and very clearly violates Youtube's terms and service.
