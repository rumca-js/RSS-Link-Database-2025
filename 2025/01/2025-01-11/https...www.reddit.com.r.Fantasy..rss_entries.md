<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished <strong>The Clown Service</strong> by Guy Adams. It’s a fun, funny horror novel, but not near as silly as the name implies. </p> <p>A fairly bad spy finds himself transferred to Section 37 of the British Intelligence service. Known as “the clown service”, this tiny branch deals with paranormal threats and is run by it’s one and only member, a fairly old fellow named August Shining who, due to some important accomplishments in the past, has been given special remit to continue operating as long as he lives. </p> <p>Our MC is quickly introduced to a fun cast of quirky, magical associates that August has accumulated over the years, and eventually ends up battling a old Russian plot involving Astral planes, zombies, and other fun things. </p> <p>The writing is both funny and surprisingly high quality (I think the title gave me lower expectations than what I ended up finding). If anything, I’d say the novel reminds me most of <strong>The R

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the &quot;what do you miss in fantasy&quot; topic, one of the things that came up a bunch was that some readers miss the more mysterious soft magic systems (the opposite of what Brandon Sanderson does with his magic systems). </p> <p>What do you think?</p> <p>Personally, I think there is definitely a place for hard magic. Readers have different tastes. Magical academia comes to mind - a story where the specific intricacies of a (hard) magic system are fascinating and necessary.</p> <p>But I tend to lean towards softer, more mysterious magic. I find that it&#39;s more...magical. </p> <p>Now I want to be clear that that does not give the author license to be completely unrealistic and use &quot;magic&quot; to extricate his characters from situations that they cannot reasonably navigate within the context of the world described until that point. The eagles in Lord of the Rings comes to mind. You read the books - or watch the movies - and invest all t

I&#39;m trying to dive right off the deep end into the waters of the fantasy world, and I ask you all to help me come up with some recommendations. I am looking for something dark and gritty, very plot heavy, preferably with some kinds of twists. I am dabbling in horror, so horror elements are also appreciated but not required. I prefer stuff more high fantasy and sword and sorcery rather than urban fantasy if possible. I&#39;m also looking for adult fiction and I&#39;m not really looking for YA.

I will read through Manuscript Wishlist and it seems as though there is an uphill climb for &quot;European inspired&quot; medieval fantasy. But I love it.
