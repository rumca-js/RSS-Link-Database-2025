I&#39;d be fine just revisiting some older fantasy, but I also really enjoy how the contemporaries of the genre have pushed to have so many female-led and focused stories (I love Lord of the Rings to death but I wish it had more than a sparse handful of female characters). </p> <p>Do you all have any recommendations that tread this line? Older works with that feel that also have female-driven narratives and avoid some of the more misogynistic pitfalls of the time? Or, newer fantasy written from that perspective which avoids what I can only vaguely describe as that &quot;modern tone&quot;?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/goodzillo\"> /u/goodzillo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:/",

I decided to give audiobooks a proper try and for whatever reason, it just stuck this time and I had a blast listening to a Dungeon Crawler Carl book. I had read the first 3 on my Kindle and I was getting frustrated I couldn&#39;t seem to do it anymore, but the audiobook just made the whole thing fun again.

I also know sarah j mass is very popular online and i was wondering if i should read her too. any recommendation will be appreciated, i&#39;m not too particular lol. thank you!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StreetOwl6933\"> /u/StreetOwl6933 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hyjk35/looking_for_beginner_fantasy_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hyjk35/looking_for_beginner_fantasy_recs/\">[comments]</a></span>",
