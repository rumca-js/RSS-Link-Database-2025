Still great and i still can&#39;t wait to give it a go. But I have a single question </p> <p>How come we have vr and vr board games, but there is absolutely nothing on rpg board games that you take over the character in vr when an action takes place? I mean this idea is absolutely amazing and I&#39;m surprised i can&#39;t find it anywhere!</p> <p>Imagine you&#39;re a rogue and sneak attack a goblin or something. But as you make your move it transfers you into the first person piece of your character in which you actually sneak attack a goblin. How does this not exist?!</p> <p>If anyone knows of a game like this please tell me</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vaultzee\"> /u/va",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I was using steam link and airlink on my quest 3 and I saw around that VD is way better than both other options and I gave it a go but no matter how much I adjust the bitrate, envoders or the quality ( tried medium and high) it feels less smooth than steam link or air link. this usually is not such a big problem except in Pavlo vr were some times the frame time spikes make it unplayable I am using an rtx 4070 super and an i5 11400f with 16gb ddr4 3200. Honestly it feels like VD is using up more cpu resources than SL or Airlink cause it feels like how a cpu bottleneck feels in normal desktop gaming. Is there any basis to what I am saying and would there be any merit to upgrading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/stavrosvita\"> /u/stavrosvita </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hyj1f6/virtual_desktop_seems_and_feels_more_laggy_than/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; ",
