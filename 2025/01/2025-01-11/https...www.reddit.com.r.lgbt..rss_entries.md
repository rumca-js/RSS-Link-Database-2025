<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m a 22-year-old med student in Jordan. My family found out I’m gay and that I’ve been in a same-sex relationship. Ever since then, they’ve treated me horribly—verbally, physically, and emotionally. They even told me the only reason I’m still alive is because I’m studying medicine.</p> <p>The pressure and abuse have completely destroyed me mentally, and my grades crashed. I ended up failing, and when they found out, they pulled me out of university. Now they’re saying they’ll get the extended family involved to “deal with me,” and I’m terrified they might actually kill me.</p> <p>I’ve been looking into asylum, but everywhere I read says Jordanians don’t get accepted because the country doesn’t criminalize being gay. I feel stuck and don’t know what to do. Are there any Jordanians out there who’ve been granted asylum or managed to migrate because of their sexuality? I really need advice or help right now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &
