Pollock’s showing is some silver lining, however.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/11/stade-francais-northampton-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In another era, the outgoing president would have made a great cold war leader. Instead, his tenure was dogged by errors, naivety and overcaution</p><p>In a week when the US bade a sad farewell to Jimmy Carter, presidential legacies came under particular scrutiny. Yet few presidents are widely remembered beyond their lifetimes, their “historic” achievements even less so. In the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon make the truly memorable list. Most of the rest are mere school-book names and dates.</p><p>Joe Biden’s standing in this unprepossessing pantheon is now being assessed, as he prepares to depart the White House on 20 January. Like his 44 predecessors, he reportedly frets about his “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/biden-election-legacy-harris-trump.html">place in history</a>”. All presidents do this. It smacks of vanity. They give valedictory lectures, endow foundations, build libraries, write memoirs.

First Toulouse and now Bordeaux have travelled to Exeter this season and been so markedly superior that a boxing referee would have stopped the fight long before the end. This was not even the visitors’ strongest team and it still resulted in a one-sided mismatch.</p><p>There was never much chance of this rebuilding Chiefs squad punching above its weight in this season’s Champions Cup anyway but they were an embarrassingly distant second here against opponents who exuded attacking class all day and could easily go deep in the competition if their key men stay fit and the Six Nations does not rob them of their current momentum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/11/exeter-bordeaux-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The broad numbers suggest that Christopher Nkunku should be one of Chelsea’s regulars.

Ultimately the sense is that some goals mean more than others. What more can Nkunku do? The answer: show more than the ability to breach opponents sitting second bottom of League Two.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/11/chelsea-morecambe-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At many points, it looked as if he never would be sentenced. That he was sentenced to nothing, then, is itself a small victory</p><p>What kind of a sentence, exactly, is an “unconditional discharge”? When Judge Juan Merchan, of New York, issued the sentence on Friday, he declared that President-elect <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, convicted in his courtroom of 34 felonies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/trump-hush-money-sentencing-new-york">will face no jail time</a>, no probation, and no fine for falsifying business records in order to conceal an affair he had with the adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the days leading up to the 2016 election. His punishment, that is, is that there will be no punishment at all.</p><p>Trump was never likely to get jail time, which would have been unusual for any defendant faced with these charges, and over the past days Merchan had signaled that he would not impose probation

Brian Eno and co-author Bette Adriaanse discuss the myth of genius, and how to really unlock your creativity</p><p>Brian Eno’s studio in Notting Hill is tucked away at the end of a cobbled mews, its facade a quarter of the normal size. The effect is like a kind of fairy-door, and as you enter, it opens on to a vast light-filled room with a spiral staircase at the centre. On one side, Eno, in a purple shirt, is hovering silently over a table top making marks on something. On the other, his latest collaborator, the Dutch artist and writer Bette Adriaanse, busies herself with the same task (they’re signing copies of their new book about art). An airy piano melody wafts over the scene: entering it feels like exhaling.</p><p>It does for me, anyway.

<p>Chinese aromatics meld with Mediterranean flavours to create a richly satisfying pasta dish</p><p>Here is a marriage of two of my favourite dishes: mapo tofu and spaghetti bolognese. Both titans of the food world, arguably neither needs to be messed with, yet here we are, simply because one day I couldn’t choose between them. There are many quotes about how indecision is bad and “the thief of opportunity”, but it can be the genesis of something new – in the kitchen, at least. The Sichuan part of the dish is represented by the aromatics – that is, ginger, garlic, spring onions and Sichuan pepper – and the “bolognese” by the sun-dried tomatoes and a trio of meaty ingredients: beetroot, walnut and mushroom. The result, I hope you’ll agree, is an exceptionally happy union.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/11/vegan-sichuan-spiced-beetroot-and-walnut-bolognese-recipe-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

The year is 1920, in a Europe that is still under the pall of the war that should have ended all wars, and Steeds’s stranger is approaching a remote farmhouse in the Provençal village of Saint-Auguste where fabled painter Edouard Tartuffe – Tata, “the Master of Light” – lives with only his niece Ettie for company.</p><p>The newcomer is young Englishman Joseph Adelaide, a disappointed artist and aspiring journalist, in flight from the tragic consequences of a war that has robbed him of his beloved brother and estranged him from his family, after his overbearing father branded him a coward for his conscientious objection.
