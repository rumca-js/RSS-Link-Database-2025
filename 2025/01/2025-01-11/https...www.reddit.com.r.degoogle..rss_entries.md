<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all!</p> <p>Throughout my degoogling experience- I found that the hardest thing to switch out of, as a college student, was Google Calendar. </p> <p>The web and mobile app made it easy for me to enter events/reminders on one device and get notifications on my phone. The task integration could be better, but as a feature, it was nice to be able to lay out all the days I would do certain homework assignments for the semester. I searched all over the internet for days, but couldn&#39;t find something that covered all my needs like that. The closest thing I could find was TickTick and <a href="http://Any.do">Any.do</a>, which I did not see as a replacement because they were primarily task management apps without event management (say, homework to do vs actually seeing my class schedule). </p> <p>I will be graduating this semester, and doubt I will be as reliant as I have been on a calendar app. But, I am considering making something that could fulfil

## Switching from e/OS/ to GrapheneOS on Pixel 5.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using /e/OS on my Pixel 5 for a while now, and overall, I&#39;ve enjoyed the degoogled experience, though there have been a few unrelated annoyances. Lately, I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of good things about GrapheneOS, so I’ve decided to give it a try. I don’t use any Google services and mostly get my apps from F-Droid and the Aurora Store, so I’m hoping the transition will be smooth.</p> <p>Before I make the switch, is there anything I should be aware of? Are there any known issues with GrapheneOS on the Pixel 5 that I should consider?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>(Sorry if this post doesn&#39;t belong here or has already been addressed. I&#39;m pretty new to reddit.) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hyourself88"> /u/hyourself88 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hz5ooy/switching_from_eos_to_grapheneos_on_pixel_5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I used to be able to download videos from Google Drive directly onto my iPhone 11 Pro (running iOS 18) without any issues. Here&#39;s how I used to do it:</p> <ol> <li>Open the video in Google Drive.</li> <li>Tap &quot;Send a Copy.&quot;</li> <li>Select &quot;Save Video&quot; or &quot;Save to Files.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>The video would either appear in my Photos app or in the Files app, depending on where I saved it.</p> <p>But now, when I try the exact same steps, nothing happens. The video doesn&#39;t show up in Photos, and it&#39;s nowhere to be found in the Files app either. I&#39;ve checked storage, permissions, and restarted my phone—still no luck.</p> <p>Is anyone else experiencing this issue? Did something change in Google Drive or iOS 18? Any solutions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prudent_Extent1923"> /u/Prudent_Extent1923 </a> <br/> <

Although I am not fully ¨degoogled&quot;, I have applied a lot of changes in my phone (FOSSifying it), thanks to a lot of what I have seen and read here (and associated attachments/references here and there).</p> <p>Now, my question (and possible self-denial) is: where does Brave stand in all of this?<br/> I have been reading so much conflicting information that I really don&#39;t know what to do regarding Brave.</p> <p>I &quot;discovered&quot; Brave last year, after moving from Microsoft to Linux, and by far it is my favourite browser ever. So it is a hard pill to swallow if it is something that I should let go.</p> <p>I really would like to know if Brave is really degoogle-unfriendly? And what are the alternatives (for mobile phones)?</p> <p>I also like Mozilla Firefox, and I have used it as my solo browser during many years, but Brave just &quot;clic
