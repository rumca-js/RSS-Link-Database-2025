I can boot from the flashed CF card with Amiga forever on my PC and that works.</p> <p>Figured it was a display setting problem and set workbench to PAL lowres in the emulator, still no luck on my A1200.</p> <p>Has anyone gotten version 24.10.10 working on original hardware?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DrReddItor"> /u/DrReddItor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hz2ku3/amigavision_20241010_on_original_hardware/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hz2ku3/amigavision_20241010_on_original_hardware/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back then I ran my A500 with a turbo card that had an IDE port on it. I now found in a box an old <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/hdd/hdd0050.htm">Conner CP30174E</a> 170MB HDD that I used on this Amiga for a few years.</p> <p>I now thought I try if it&#39;s somehow possible to still access it so I put it into an external USB IDE adapter that was from around 2010 and still works with the original disk that it came with.</p> <p>However putting the Conner into the adapter just gives an I/O error. The disk turns on and does something that sounds like self test but when I connect it via USB it just gives I/O error.</p> <p><code>[135202.258171] sda: unable to read partition table</code></p> <p><code>[135202.258203] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk</code></p> <p><code>~$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=./hdd.img</code></p> <p><code>dd: error reading &#39;/dev/sda&#39;: Input/output error</code></p> <p><code>0+0 records in</code></p> <p><code>0+0 records o

In resurrecting my A1200 (and CD32) and not being able to find any of my joysticks I decided to make one. I designed a body for 3d printing to hold a Mame joystick. It has options for Left/Right handed or ambidextrous (or two distinct buttons if you&#39;d like).</p> <p>All the details <a href="https://than.gs/m/1242907">are on Thangs</a>. I initially tested it on my CD32 - it works, but single button is pretty useless in the games I tried (Jetstrike, Jungle Strike) - was OK for Banshee.
