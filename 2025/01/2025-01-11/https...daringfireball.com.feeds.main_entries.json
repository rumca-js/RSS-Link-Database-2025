Meta typically alters\npolicies that govern its apps\u2009\u2014\u2009which include Facebook,\nInstagram, WhatsApp and Threads\u2009\u2014\u2009by inviting employees, civic\nleaders and others to weigh in. Any shifts generally take months.\nBut Mr. Zuckerberg turned this latest effort into a closely held\nsix-week sprint, blindsiding even employees on his policy and\nintegrity teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Months-long processes with a large number of stakeholders from inside and outside the company are the way you make policy changes intended to be as uncontroversial as possible. A six-week sprint with a tight team is how you make policy changes that you know will be controversial. The process was unusual because the nature of the changes was unusual.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In interviews, more than a doz",
