My younger sister was using my old laptop for a while for school and told me she didn&#39;t need it anymore cuz she got a Chromebook for school so she gave it back and its performance was quite poor. It was running Windows 11 and was idling at something like 55% so I decided to wipe Windows from it and run Linux, saw a few Youtube videos on which Linux distro to install, and as I&#39;m a Computer Science major (\ud83e\udd13) I decided to install Arch as I don&#39;t mind living in the terminal. So far the performance is amazing, Seeing the cpu usage around 1-2% was something that I thought I&#39;d never see. I still can&#39;t believe how well my old laptop is performing considering it used to lag and freeze while having one Chrome tab open with a Youtube video playing.</p> <p>I did run into some issues like not having some shortcuts working (screenshot, Windows+Tab) but they were easy fixes and some issues with the size of m",

I&#39;m sure youtube has good videos but they&#39;re under a mountain of fluff!</p> <p>What videos or channels (or search queries) can you recommend of people just casually using their computers? Are you proud of how you&#39;ve set up ypur computer and want to share your workflow?
