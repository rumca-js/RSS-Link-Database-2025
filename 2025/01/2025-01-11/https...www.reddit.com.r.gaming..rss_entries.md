I’m nearly 40 and have been gaming since I was a small child, starting with classics like <em>Monkey Island 2</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Golden Axe</em>. While I’ve always loved gaming, I’ve never considered myself a hardcore gamer—I’ve typically played games on normal difficulty. For me, immersion in the game world and the role-playing experience are just as important, if not more so, than gameplay mechanics. I mainly play games to relax, so higher difficulties have never appealed to me.</p> <p>Of course, as a gamer, it’s impossible not to have heard of the <em>Dark Souls</em> series. After managing to finish a few games considered challenging, like <em>Celeste</em>, <em>Cuphead</em>, and <em>Hollow Knight</em>, I decided to give <em>Dark Souls</em> a try. I started with <em>Dark Souls 3</em> since it was the most modern e
