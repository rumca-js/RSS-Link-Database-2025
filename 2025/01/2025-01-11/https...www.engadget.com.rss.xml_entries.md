However, among all the quadcopters, questionably benevolent robots and devices with fancy flexible screens, there's a lot of small things that go into making CES a one-of-a-kind event. To highlight some of the silly, stupid and occasionally wholesome things we encountered at the show this year, we humbly present the very unofficial Dumb Fun awards for CES 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Fortnite Festival</em> will support local multiplayer starting Tuesday January 14, meaning you‚Äôll be able to sit down in a room with your friends and jam out on plastic guitar controllers together just like the good ol‚Äô days. Of course, most of us probably don‚Äôt have those plastic guitars anymore, but regular controllers will work just fine too. The feature is coming to Xbox and PlayStation, and up to four local players will be supported at a time for the Festival Main Stage mode. Maybe it‚Äôs the nostalgia talking, but this kind of rules?</p>
