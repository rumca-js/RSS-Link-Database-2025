Also the whole blair mountain but in space is very very appealing to me. The fact it has solo mode which i do play nearly as often in other games as with friends also is something that seems to allure me. The 2 vs2 modes are also interesting concepts...<br/> BUUUUUUT- I could not find good/deep revievs nor a playthrought So if any1 played it and could say if its worth the price or how the solo or 2v2 performs i would be gratefull!

Salton Sea is a heavy game in a small box. I&#39;ve spent a fair bit of time with Salton Sea and it definitely deserves some props for its ingenuity.</p> <p>The core gameplay loops consists of taking turns to use your actions (4 at the beginning of the game, crowing to 7 by the end) to buy digging rights, dig and then extract brine, then converting that to energy, which you can then either sell, or use to complete contracts. On top of that you can also buy shares, come up with buisness plans, and repair your equipment. All these actions are exteemely simple to excecute though.</p> <p>Writing &quot;multi-use cards&quot; as the games mechanic sounds really funn",
