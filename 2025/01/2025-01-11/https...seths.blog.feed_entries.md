Almost all car crashes would be avoided if the driver were just going a bit slower. (That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s more accurate to call them &#8220;crashes&#8221; and not &#8220;accidents.&#8221;) That doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t have bold plans. That&#8217;s essential. It&#8217;s the last-second shortcuts that get us into trouble. Hurry, but don&#8217;t rush.
