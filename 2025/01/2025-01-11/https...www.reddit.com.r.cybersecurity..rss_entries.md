<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Everyone,</p> <p>We recently purchased the KnowBe4 cybersecurity awareness training platform and their Phishing ER service . We are in the process of developing a cybersecurity awareness training program for our organization. I’d love to have a brainstorming discussion with the community about how you use this tool (or similar products) in your organizations.</p> <p>A few specific questions:</p> <p>1- What is your process for new employees? Do you require them to complete training before granting access to email and systems? If so, how do you share the training with them if they don’t yet have a business email address?</p> <p>2- How often do you run phishing simulations?</p> <p>3- What is the ideal length for training modules? Do you find shorter, frequent sessions more effective, or longer, comprehensive ones?</p> <p>4- How do users log in to the KnowBe4 portal to complete their training? Do you use SSO (Single Sign-On) for authentication?</p> <p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m starting a new role on the Incident Response team very soon. It will be me and one other team member, plus our supervisor from time to time. I’m somewhat nervous the workload will be relentless (also an on-call element but I don’t mind it) but am excited for the challenge. What was your experience working in very small (less than 5-man I guess?) security teams? I suppose it depends on the size of the company. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kasual__"> /u/Kasual__ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hykkh6/what_was_the_smallest_security_team_youve_worked/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hykkh6/what_was_the_smallest_security_team_youve_worked/">[comments]</a></span>

## Wouldn't making TOR faster cause issues?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years ago, the TOR project announced Arti, a multi-core rewrite in Rust. One of the benefits is that it should make the network much faster, which I love, but wouldn&#39;t that introduce new issues? I imagine one of the primary defenses old onion sites have is the slow network speed, which bottlenecks vuln scans and brute forcing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deadface008"> /u/deadface008 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hyjujp/wouldnt_making_tor_faster_cause_issues/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hyjujp/wouldnt_making_tor_faster_cause_issues/">[comments]</a></span>
