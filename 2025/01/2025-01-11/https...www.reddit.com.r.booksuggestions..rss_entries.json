Lots of examples of people who were not happy with what they had and endlessly pursued more more more until their inevitable \u201cdestruction\u201d.</p> <p>I found this fascinating, especially in today\u2019s society. Social media pushes us to \u201ckeep up with the Jones\u2019s\u201d and always needing more. Then it talked about examples of people who did great financially because they were content with what they had and where they were in life. </p> <p>Can you think of any books that pursue this further? Like being content with what you have, gratitude and appreciation, getting off the \u201crat race\u201d so to speak.

I would like more vibes like this. It doesn&#39;t have to be heavy metal, but has a strong love of music in there. It also doesn&#39;t have to be romance genre per-say, but a love story would be nice. And before you suggest it, yes I have read Daisy Jones and the Six, which I didn&#39;t love, actually.

Furthermore, they often display a reluctance to exert the necessary effort to achieve national and patriotic ideals and are unwilling to pay the price required for such accomplishments. As a consequence, these societies frequently find themselves in a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to false prejudices and unwarranted pride, some individuals within these societies may harbor the belief that they possess comprehensive knowledge and may attribute unrealistic value and credit to themselves.</p> <p> </p> <p>They often refuse to acknowledge their own weaknesses and errors, consistently shifting the blame onto others for their mistakes.

I am an extremely anxious woman, so I am seeking something soothing and calming. Right now I am reading Full Moon Coffee Shop which, admittedly, is not all that great, but it really puts my mind in a good place for sleeping. I\u2019m looking for something that might include some of these key words: slice-of-life, animals, light fantasy, spirituality, city life, world cultures, coffee shops, magic.</p> <p>The vibe should be light, breezy, whimsical, cute, and/or cozy. I\u2019m not looking for the novel of the year here; just a light, positive read that can slow my thoughts, calm my body, and help me prepare for sleep.</p> <p>Many thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TamagotchiAngel\"> /u/TamagotchiAngel </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hyliqc/bedtime_book_recommendations/\">[lin",
