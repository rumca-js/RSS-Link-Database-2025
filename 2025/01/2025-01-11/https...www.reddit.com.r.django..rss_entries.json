But, using a Python virtual environment inside a Docker container is generally unnecessary and can even be counterproductive. As a container itself provides an isolated environment and does not need further isolation using virtual environments. When you create a Docker image, it includes its own filesystem, libraries, and dependencies. Using a virtual environment in container adds unneeded steps and unnecessary complexity. You&#39;d need to create and activate the virtual environment during container startup. We can avoid this.</p> <h1>How?</h1> <p>we can use <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\">uv</a> for package installation in Docker without a virtual environment using &quot;--system&quot; flag</p> <pre><code>uv pip install --system &lt;package&gt; uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt </code></pre> <p",
