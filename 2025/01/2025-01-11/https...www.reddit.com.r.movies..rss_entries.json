She was really great and it was so amazing to see her in a more dramatic role. Also loved the styling/the way it was shot and the fact that Gia shot in on film instead of digital it really added to the visuals. Pleasantly surprised to see Brenda Song who was great, (wished she had more scene time) even though I had liked a photo on her insta about the film months before lol really forgot she was in it. But she was great too! Jamie amazing as always and Kiernan was so talented. I haven\u2019t really seen her in much (just Sabrina and a little bit of Mad Men) but it seems like this is her more adult role than the things she usually does. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/betsielove27\"> /u/betsielove27 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hyyoay/the_last_showgirl",

I really like the song they used in the 1st trailer, I thought it was catching. I really love how very cool, fun, action-packed, funny, lighthearted, interesting, dramatic and thrilling the movie is going to be like from watching the Transformers One trailers and other clips. And the thing that I really liked the most is besides it being a Transformers movie in animation form, but it is also the fact that it&#39;s a Transformers movie that is truly kid-friendly for kids. As in like it&#39;s design primarily for a younger audience of kids(while still also for the whole family, parents who were fans of Transformers since they were ki",
