<p>This fascinating documentary looks at people who have traded modern life to live on minuscule British islets. Its script might be banal, but their existence is a joy to see</p><p>Our Tiny Islands is dangerous television. Ostensibly the gentlest of concepts, this four-part series of hour-long documentaries narrated by Meera Syal is about life on some of the hundreds of minute, ancient islands scattered off Britain’s coastline. Not your Lundys, Lindisfarnes or Merseas – which are Manhattan, Vegas and Dubai compared with what is on offer here – but scraps of land where birds and wildflowers outnumber humans by thousands to one, the only transport is boats or bikes and life is what you make it. It is paradise for introverts.</p><p>We are talking about the likes of Rathlin, a puffin-stuffed 14.5 sq km (5.6 sq miles) off the coast of Northern Ireland, home to 150 people including ferryman Tom and assorted RSPB staff and volunteers who are preparing to rid the place of rats and ferrets –

<p>The 2024 Golden Boot winner flopped at Everton and faded away at Real Madrid but is still a maestro for Colombia</p><p>On Monday, Rayo Vallecano released James Rodríguez on a free transfer. It hadn’t been much of a stay. In four and a half months at the club, he managed 136 minutes of league football. Only once did he start in La Liga. Rodríguez is 33 now. Since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/sep/22/james-rodriguez-and-everton-beautiful-doomed-marriage-qatar">he left Everton in 2021</a>, he has started just 37 league games and scored only 10 goals. This is the sixth season in a row in which he has been released on a free transfer as he has drifted from Real Madrid to the team currently 12th in the table, via Qatar, Greece and Brazil. The sense is of a waning career nearing its end.</p><p>And yet in those three and a half years since his last game for Everton, Rodríguez has played 32 times for Colombia. While at Rayo, he has played 374 international minutes

<p></p><p>They might have pulled the plug on the documentary a week too soon. It’s been a strange two weeks for Plymouth. First they sacked Wayne Rooney. Then, despite being managerless, they broke their transfer record to sign the Ghana international striker Michael Baidoo. Then they appointed the 42-year-old Austrian manager Miron Muslic to succeed Rooney. And then, to cap it all, with the interim duo of the first-team coach Kevin Nancekivell and the club captain Joe Edwards still in charge, they pulled off their most eye-catching result in years, Morgan Whittaker’s 82nd-minute goal giving them victory over Premier League Brentford.<br><br>
 In the nine away games before Rooney was sacked, Plymouth’s run of results read: 0-2, 0-4, 0-2, 0-4, 1-6, 1-1, 0-3, 0-1, 0-5. “How shit must you be? We’re drawing away,” the away fans were singing within five seconds – a line in gallows humour that earned a discernible laugh form the home end. But this really didn’t look like a side that has co

<p>In 1983 <a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/david-hurn/">David Hurn</a> met one of his photographic heroes, André Kertész , and jokingly suggested that, when he reached Kertész’s age of 89, he would remake his seminal volume, On Reading. True to his word, the Magnum photographer has now done so. Wherever Hurn travelled as a photojournalist, he took images of people reading books, magazines and, lately, on mobile phones. “One of the things that happens in every country in the world is people read,” he says. “It’s lovely to read – the touch of the paper, the ease of being able to check back a few pages. But we’re at a time now where we’re not quite sure whether, in the future, books on paper are going to disappear.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://rrbphotobooks.com/products/0201009003501?srsltid=AfmBOoqrU79PYqZOpYkn8g4UAoalDIvlSc3KGY2NZZWtOiozzoFEuyPs">David Hurn’s </a><em><a href="https://rrbphotobooks.com/products/0201009003501?srsltid=AfmBOoqrU79PYqZOpYkn8g4UAoalDIvlSc

The airport itself was a rowdy scene: cabs and Ubers stalled as angry protesters blocked the roads, meters still running; demonstrators in hijabs prayed on their protest signs in baggage claim as others shouted at any arriving flyer coming for their luggage.

<p>New, and old, manager has the experience owners see as vital to lift club from relegation fight and restore lost values</p><p>The prospect of David Moyes returning as Everton manager was met with an almost snobbish disdain when mooted twice before. It illustrates the diverging fortunes of the Scot and the club that the welcome mat has been laid out third time around.</p><p>Moyes was close to becoming Everton manager again in December 2019, after Marco Silva’s reign had come to an unceremonious end. He held talks with Farhad Moshiri in Germany and expected to sign terms the following day, only for Napoli to make Carlo Ancelotti available by sacking him that night. A genuine sliding doors moment. Moshiri went for the superstar option. Moyes joined West Ham for the second time, where his contentment and success meant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/12/david-moyes-ends-speculation-by-signing-long-term-west-ham-deal">he could resist Everton’s advances</a> when th

I took my youngest son, Jacob, who is 21 and has come with me to watch a few opposition teams.

A new year has just begun, and there is still snow on the ground, but the same raw pain churns though Simpson.

<p>Saint John lived in a cave here and wrote about the Apocalypse, but these days the quiet shores of beautiful Patmos nurture happier thoughts</p><p>Of all the Greek islands, Patmos is easily the most serene to me. Although a little smaller in area than, say, Cambridge (at about 13&nbsp;square miles), it’s richly sprinkled with monasteries, and&nbsp;is&nbsp;known as the “Jerusalem of the Aegean”. The main town, Chora, has more than 40 chapels, and not a single cornershop or grocery. Meanwhile, down on Petra Bay, there’s a rock for hermits, rising up like a five-storey Swiss cheese, complete with cells and cisterns and 11th-century plumbing.</p><p>Patmians are still happily self-contained. During our week, we met some who’d never left the island. Others would save up all their medical problems for an annual, eight-hour voyage to Athens. But most were happy just being Patmian: fishing, thinking, building little hotels or teasing vegetables out of the rock.</p> <a href="https://www.the

<p>The clever, idiosyncratic satire of workplace culture returns for a visually stunning second season. But don’t expect its mysterious plot to go easy on viewers</p><p>In my early 20s, I worked for a pub that was half drinking establishment, half massive children’s soft play area. While adult intoxication and parties for under-10s sounds like an odd commercial pairing (or does it?), it did mean that the pub’s employees had to work hard, serving pints for the adults and, for the chosen few, dressing up as a giant bear and waving to the kids assembled for little Jack’s seventh birthday party. I bring this up because I still remember a poster on the wall of the bleak staffroom that read “A&nbsp;smile costs nothing”.
