Scientists have identified lipocartilage, a newly classified type of cartilage featuring fat-filled, balloon-like cells that offer elasticity and structural stability. Found in the external ears, noses, and throats of mammals, including humans, this tissue differs from traditional cartilage types by maintaining its size regardless of calorie intake. First observed in the 19th century and rediscovered through modern research, lipocartilage has distinct molecular traits and unique properties. Researchers believe it could improve our understanding of cartilage functionality, evolution, and regenerative capabilities

Astronomers have detected water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of WASP-166 b, a hot super-Neptune exoplanet. Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the findings also noted ammonia in smaller quantities. WASP-166 b, located 368 light-years away, is a massive planet that orbits its star every 5.44 days, with a temperature of 1,270 K. The discovery sheds light on planetary composition and the potential mechanisms behind atmospheric formation

## Human Hunting More Responsible for Kangaroo Extinction than Climate Change

A recent study of ancient kangaroo teeth contradicts previous beliefs that climate change caused their extinction. By examining the wear on teeth, researchers found that kangaroos had flexible diets, which made them resilient to climate shifts. This evidence suggests that human hunting activities, rather than dietary limitations, played a more significant role in the disappearance of kangaroos and other large animals around 40,000 years ago. The study opens up new possibilities for understanding the extinction of Pleistocene species in Australia

Scientists from the University of Cambridge and Argonne National Laboratory have uncovered a link between ferroelectric domain walls and superconductivity in 2D materials. Their study shows how specific structural features enhance electron-phonon interactions, especially in materials like molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe₂), paving the way for new superconducting devices. Future research aims to explore the potential of layering polar materials and designing new superconductors using domain wall networks

Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket launch, initially set for Jan. 10, has been delayed to Jan. 12 due to rough Atlantic seas affecting the booster landing plan. The rocket, standing 320 feet tall, features a reusable first stage and aims to advance space mission cost-efficiency. Launch is planned from Cape Canaveral with a three-hour window. If further delays occur, backup opportunities are available until Jan. 16, per FAA notices

Recent observations by an amateur astronomer reveal that Jupiter’s clouds may not consist of ammonia ice as previously assumed. Using a technique called band-depth analysis, Steve Hill mapped ammonia concentrations in the planet’s atmosphere, finding reflective layers deeper than expected. These findings suggest the clouds may be composed of ammonium hydrosulfide or photochemical products. The study, supported by professional astronomers, highlights complex photochemistry in Jupiter's atmosphere and reshapes understanding of gas giants
