<p>Mike Isaac, Sheera Frenkel, and Kate Conger, reporting for the NYT in the best-sourced piece I’ve seen on Meta’s big policy changes this week (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The entire process was highly unusual. Meta typically alters
policies that govern its apps — which include Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads — by inviting employees, civic
leaders and others to weigh in. Any shifts generally take months.
But Mr. Zuckerberg turned this latest effort into a closely held
six-week sprint, blindsiding even employees on his policy and
integrity teams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Months-long processes with a large number of stakeholders from inside and outside the company are the way you make policy changes intended to be as uncontroversial as possible. A six-week sprint with a tight team is how you make policy changes that you know will be controversial. The process was unusual because the nature of the changes was unusual.</p>

<p>Good piece and great headline by Charlie Warzel at The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The social-media hall monitors have been so restrictive on “topics
of immigration and gender that they’re out of touch with
mainstream discourse,” Zuckerberg said with the zeal of an
activist. He spoke about “a cultural tipping point towards once
again prioritizing speech” following “nonstop” concerns about
misinformation from the “legacy media” and four years of the
United States government “pushing for censorship.” It is clear
from Zuckerberg’s announcement that he views establishment powers
as having tried and failed to solve political problems by
suppressing his users. That message is sure to delight Donald
Trump and the incoming administration. But there’s one tiny hitch.
Zuckerberg is talking about himself and his own policies. The
establishment? That’s him.</p>

and Threads, are being <a href="https://www.wired.com/story

<p>There were several interesting announcements made at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k82RwXqZHY8">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s Keynote at CES 2025</a>, including a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-announces-rtx-50-series-at-up-to-usd1-999">new RTX 50 generation of gaming GPUs</a> and an upcoming $3,000 Mac-Mini-sized “personal AI supercomputer” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337530/nvidia-ces-digits-super-computer-ai">called Project Digits</a>. But most interesting to me was the scale of the keynote itself: <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ces-2025-jensen-huang/">over 6,000 attendees</a> in an arena at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. <a href="https://x.com/stevesi/status/1876459484807143437?s=10">Just look at it</a>: it resembled a rock concert more than a tech keynote.<sup id="fnr1-2025-01-11"><a href="#fn1-2025-01-11">1</a></sup></p>
