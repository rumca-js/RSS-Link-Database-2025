Today&#39;s paper is titled &quot;Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Public Transportation: San Antonio Case Study&quot; by Ramya Jonnala, Gongbo Liang, Jeong Yang, and Izzat Alsmadi.</p> <p>This paper investigates the transformative potential of large language models (LLMs) in optimizing public transportation systems, using San Antonio as a case study. The authors leverage natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to improve various facets of public transit, including route planning, passenger communication, and operational efficiency. The study involves a comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models to evaluate their proficiency in handling transportation-specific data and inquiries. </p> <p>Key Findings: 1. <strong>Route Optimization and Scheduling</strong>: The study highlights LLMs&#39; ability to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The key advance here is combining LLMs with iterative web search in a way that allows autonomous refinement of search queries based on reasoning needs. Rather than using fixed retrieval patterns, the system dynamically decides when and what to search for during complex reasoning tasks.</p> <p>Main technical points: - <strong>Dual-encoder architecture</strong> separates reasoning and search components - Uses <strong>iterative search refinement</strong> where each query builds on previous results - Implements a <strong>self-reflection mechanism</strong> to evaluate search result quality - Search behavior emerges without explicit training for search strategies</p> <p>Results from their evaluation: - 8-15% improvement over standard RAG models on reasoning benchmarks - 45% reduction in hallucination/factual errors - Performance gains were consistent across different model sizes - Search patterns showed similarities to human information-seeking behavior</p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i first asked deepseek v3 to explain this, and then asked chatgpt-4 to evaluate its assessments for accuracy. </p> <p>deepseek v3:</p> <p>&quot;Your point underscores a transformative shift: as AI becomes more affordable and capable, the world may no longer need billionaires. AI can autonomously identify high-impact projects, optimize resources, and drive innovation, reducing reliance on billionaire-led investment. Crucially, AI can also assume the vision and risk-taking roles that billionaires currently fulfill. By analyzing vast datasets and predicting trends, AI can make bold, data-driven decisions to fund groundbreaking ideas, often with greater precision and fewer biases than humans. This eliminates the need for concentrated wealth to drive progress.</p> <p>Moreover, AI can democratize access to capital and opportunities, ensuring investments prioritize social good over personal profit. In philanthropy, AI can distribute resources equitably and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to be an ambitious person who hoped to achieve great things with my life. Sadly, because of the prospect of AGI, it seems that I was born too late to have any chance at doing that. I graduated college this past spring and had planned on getting a PhD but I scraped that plan because it was not clear to me whether that would pay off since AGI may well be only a few years away. As such, I ended up just getting a job right out of college so as to maximize the amount of money I make in the short term. To this end, I even opted out of a 401k because what is the point of saving money if AGI is only a few years away? Now, normally, I would be trying very hard at my job, making an earnest effort to advance in the field, but instead I am just doing the minimal amount of work required to not get fired because it seems like there are no long-term prospects.</p> <p>Ever since I learned about GPT-3 sometime in 2021, I have been living in a perpetual state o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AI has been around for a while now, with tools like ChatGPT, Meta AI, and others. I personally use these tools for their convenience and features. However, I recently came across news that OpenAI is working on AI robots designed to replace office workers. These robots are being marketed as capable of performing all the tasks a human worker can—without complaints, health benefits, or salaries. Other companies also seem to be racing to develop similar technologies.</p> <p>This development makes me anxious and raises two significant concerns:</p> <pre><code>1. Career Choices in an AI-Driven Future: </code></pre> <p>As AI continues to evolve, it feels like it’s encroaching on human jobs. What kind of career should I pursue that won’t be overtaken by AI? It’s hard to know where humans will remain indispensable.</p> <pre><code>2.

## Will the complexity of AI art finally surpass 3DCG in the future decades?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When 3DCG first became commercially viable, artists could generate realistic images with computers, achieving nearly perfect perspective and a variety of reusable 3D assets without needing to color them themselves. However, after decades of development, today&#39;s 3DCG has become extremely complex. Some visual effects software, such as Houdini, involves advanced mathematics and physics in its simulation module. True experts can even implement new algorithms from research papers using these software tools. Combining simulation modules with other modules like SOP often leads to very complex projects. The emergence of AI has significantly lowered the barrier for creating exquisite artworks, evolving from simple prompt-based generation to tools like ComfyUI that allow for precise adjustments. Do you think that in another ten years, the complexity of AI art will surpass that of 3DCG?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.
