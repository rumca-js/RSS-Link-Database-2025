I have a 5800X3D RTX3080 driver 565.77, running off a Gen3 nvme. </p> <p>Everything else runs fine, and WoW had been up until yesterday - lutris doesn&#39;t seem to have any logs on what is happening either. I don&#39;t seem to have a trigger for it happening, I&#39;ll just be questing or standing around chatting in game then it freezes and no keyboard inputs to open terminal or whatever either.

I have a Linux machine with an i7-12650h + RTX3060 +16Gb Ram and while I\u2019m playing games through proton it runs perfectly. Thing is, there are a couple Japanese games, especially VNs that I like playing that fail to run through proton, so I installed a Windows VM through KVM, but the performance is terrible, VNs are mostly text based and the text is lagging to appear(Around 4FPS). I tried the exact same thing in a M2 Mac 8Gb RAM using Parallels Virtualization and the same game runs perfectly 60FPS even when upscaling it to the Mac resolution, what I don\u2019t understand is that technically the Mac is running the game not only through a VM but also translating the game X86 architecture to run on Windows for ARM, and the Linux machine doesn\u2019t have this extra step.</p> <p>Would just the Mac cpu being faster explain it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Eve_00013\"> /u/Ev",

My initial intention was to setup bazzite but their steam gaming mode is unsupported on the UHD. Since I do not game on this machine directly (as if it could) I could care less about proton or anything related to steam. I just want to be able to turn the machine on and only have to use a controller to navigate from there and launch moonlight, jellyfin, whatever else comes to mind.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Mastodon-1253\"> /u/Low-Mastodon-1253 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hyy0ns/console_like_distro_for_intel_uhd/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hyy0ns/console_like_distro_for_intel_uhd/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;m using a 7900XTX.</p> <p>Playing under Vulkan the game will be totally fine but after around 30-40min it will begin stuttering like crazy. I imagine this is a kerne1l/driver-level issue.</p> <p>Anyway, I thought I&#39;d give Gamescope a whirl. I&#39;ve never had to use it, but I&#39;ve heard good things. I did the usual setup and the game is running fantastic. Absolutely no stutter after extended play (so far).</p> <p>My problem is that a whole slew of keys simply are not recognized at all under Gamescope. For example, simple keys like &quot;S&quot; or &quot;I&quot; just do not register at all. I&#39;ve tried &quot;grab keyboard&quot; in the command, but it doesn&#39;t seem to matter.</p> <p>Am I missing something?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prome",
