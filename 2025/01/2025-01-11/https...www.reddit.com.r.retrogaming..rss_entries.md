<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So yesterday I played DD2 and he did a standing knee hit I never seen before(I completed the game several times back in 90&#39;s), he made I think 3 hits in the row with standing knee. And I never seen he does standing knee or I forgot it exists. Today I tried to figure out and seems he does the knee after the enemy standing up after a fall. However he does uppercut after knee or grab(if move towards enemy).<br/> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOH8Ucixjg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQOH8Ucixjg</a><br/> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcVJtLSp8zo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcVJtLSp8zo</a><br/> It&#39;s quite hard to catch the moment to make the knee hit the enemy, it mostly misses, cuz started too early. So today I am not sure already had I see the 3 knees combo or was it knee + grab that makes knee hits(like in the second video). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gam
