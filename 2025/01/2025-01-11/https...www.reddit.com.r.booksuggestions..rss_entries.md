Social media pushes us to ‚Äúkeep up with the Jones‚Äôs‚Äù and always needing more. Then it talked about examples of people who did great financially because they were content with what they had and where they were in life. </p> <p>Can you think of any books that pursue this further?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Excerpts from &quot;The End of Silence by George Ernest&quot;</strong> </p> <p>The biography of the false culture that currently pervades the societies in question is marked by numerous anomalies. These societies have never exhibited a strong commitment to the advancement of logic and the rule of law. Furthermore, they often display a reluctance to exert the necessary effort to achieve national and patriotic ideals and are unwilling to pay the price required for such accomplishments. As a consequence, these societies frequently find themselves in a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to false prejudices and unwarranted pride, some individuals within these societies may harbor the belief that they possess comprehensive knowledge and may attribute unrealistic value and credit to themselves.</p> <p> </p> <p>They often refuse to acknowledge their own weaknesses and errors, consistently shifting the blame onto others for their mistakes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I do NOT like romance novels. I like b-plot romances. Preferably enemies to lovers. BUT there must be some other main plot unrelated to the romance. I was wondering if there are any books out there that have a good female lead with multiple &quot;suitors&quot; as well as a good, unrelated, main conflict. Any fiction genre will do really. Even better if it isn&#39;t obvious who ends up together. I&#39;ve never read a book with reverse harem dynamic. Only a webtoon and I loved the strong and powerful female lead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Desperate_Cheek4309"> /u/Desperate_Cheek4309 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hynjyb/reverse_haremtype_bplot_romance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hynjyb/reverse_haremtype_bplot_romance/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Last week I was in a quaint bookshop and saw it as a great opportunity (obviously) to buy some books that have been on my list for a while. The problem, now that I‚Äôve procured these books, is that I don‚Äôt know which one to start with! They all seem great. So my question is to you all: which of these books of you could read again would you read? I look forward to your responses!</p> <p>Pale Fire (Nabokov) Ada, or Ardor (Nabokov) The Magic Mountain (Mann) The Master and Margarita (Bulgakov)</p> <p>Don‚Äôt worry about my preferences, just what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Guitarchitectography"> /u/Guitarchitectography </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hyjbjk/which_of_these_would_you_read_again_for_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hyjbjk/which_of_these_would_you_read_a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I usually play a lot of video games but lately i‚Äôve been burnt out on them and wanted to try reading some books, especially since i haven‚Äôt read a book since high school. I‚Äôm a fan of the game dark souls so maybe a book with a grim fantasy setting like the game would be interesting to me. Also maybe a book that‚Äôs on the easier side to read? I‚Äôm okay with a bit of a challenge to read but i feel like if it‚Äôs too hard it‚Äôll turn me away. If you want anything else to go off of let me know and i‚Äôll try to reply asap.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/only_the_important"> /u/only_the_important </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hyj9ge/switching_from_video_games_to_books_which_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hyj9ge/switching_from_video_games_to_books_which_books/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, 19m looking for some (growth/self-improvement) books about relationships, both platonic and romantic.</p> <p>Let me clarify, I‚Äôm not bad at making friends in the slightest. I‚Äôm pretty extroverted (although i love my alone time) and always fit into social situations well. Even when I travel solo I always find people to spend time with and manage pretty well, so i‚Äôm not looking for any books out of loneliness or desperation.</p> <p>However, one thing i‚Äôve always noticed and find challenging, is finding and maintaining deep long term relationships. Even though I make friends pretty quickly, I don‚Äôt really have very close friendships with people i truly connect with. I also date around, but i do find it hard to find someone that i truly match with and want to be serious with. </p> <p>Maybe I‚Äôm in my own head to much, overcomplicate friendships or expect too much. I would love some book recommendations to help me live in the moment and help me find (o
