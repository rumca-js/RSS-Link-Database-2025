<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to share my journey building a custom ecommerce site for a client. While I have experience creating enterprise tools and APIs for inventory management and ecommerce integrations (like Shopify), this project was unique because the client specifically wanted a fully custom-built platform tailored to their needs. It‚Äôs my first time creating a complete ecommerce site with Django, and the learning experience has been incredible.</p> <p>The project, <a href="https://www.getvases.com">GetVases</a>, is an online boutique for selling vases. It needed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and reliable. Balancing these requirements while diving into features like payment integration and stock management was both exciting and challenging.</p> <h1>Technical Challenges</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Integrating Payments with Stripe</strong>: Secure payment processing was a priority for the client.

## MongoDB with Django, WHY?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anybody here ever needed to use MongoDB with Django? I&#39;m curious to know why there is such a demand for MongoDB in the Django community, considering that Django&#39;s ORM is deeply tied to a relational structure. Why the push for Mongo?</p> <p>And by &quot;demand,&quot; I mean enough people want this for me to notice.</p> <p>The top recommendations I keep seeing are terrible.</p> <ol> <li>Use **Pymongo** - This is bad because you loose a lot of Django features such as the built-in ORM, Auth, etc</li> <li>**Djongo** - This is NOT a valid solution. Only works with Django 3.0.5 and does not really work. Also, it has not been maintained for several years.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dennisivy"> /u/dennisivy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hz5iby/mongodb_with_django_why/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comme

## Docker + uv - virtual environments

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Why?</h1> <p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> uses an existing virtual environment(.venv) or creates one if it doesn&#39;t exist. But, using a Python virtual environment inside a Docker container is generally unnecessary and can even be counterproductive. As a container itself provides an isolated environment and does not need further isolation using virtual environments. When you create a Docker image, it includes its own filesystem, libraries, and dependencies. Using a virtual environment in container adds unneeded steps and unnecessary complexity. You&#39;d need to create and activate the virtual environment during container startup. We can avoid this.</p> <h1>How?</h1> <p>we can use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> for package installation in Docker without a virtual environment using &quot;--system&quot; flag</p> <pre><code>uv pip install --system &lt;package&gt; uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt </code></pre> <p
