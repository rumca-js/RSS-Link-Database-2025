<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking to clone my mSD to a new NVMe SSD but wanted to ensure something before trying it out. My current mSD is partitioned with both rpiOS and RetroPie - if I use rpi-clone to move everything over to the new SSD, I’m assuming it maintains the partitions and everything in them, correct? This seems like the case from reading up on it, but wanted to be sure before running it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zaxonortesus"> /u/zaxonortesus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hz1kw6/rpiclone_partition_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hz1kw6/rpiclone_partition_question/">[comments]</a></span>

I have been digging so far into so many different posts to try to get my €7 screen from AliExpress to go beyond what everyone else has been saying is possible on 64bit. My goal was to get this beast as smooth as silk so I could play DoDonPachi. Honestly, I couldn&#39;t find any information on how to achieve this with TFT screens that are NOT HDMI.</p>

## Question about monitoring a 220v outlet with relay

I have an outlet on that circuit (I initially thought before I looked at it, that it was a regular 110v outlet). Originally I was thinking that I would wire it such that the relay is controlled by the well pump circuit, so relay is open when pump is off, closed when pump is on. Then I&#39;d use a GPIO pin on the Pi to monitor the state of the relay. </p> <p>However it turns out that the pump circuit is 220v. It has a 6-15p female outlet. So obviously I cannot plug in my 5v transformer to feed the relay.</p> <p>I thought about rewiring the outlet with a split duplex, but I want to know if I can drive the relay using 220v directly. The relay says it&#39;s rated for 10amps at 250v AC, but I don&#39;t know what that means. Would it work to drive it directly with AC off the 220v if I get an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I fiddled around to have vnc (tightvncserver) always available (via ssh-tunnel) on my raspberry pi 5 after new startups as I am using it headless. When trying to set up a systemd unit service for the autostart of vncserver I encountered different problems that are probably somehow related to lxpolkit which I wasn&#39;t able to understand nor solve.</p> <p>Now I found a simpler solution that works great for me: I start the vncserver via the ssh-connection when the tunnel is connected.</p> <p>I am using Remmina to connect to the vncserver where I configured the connection with the ssh-tunneling option (Basic tab: Server at &quot;localhost:5901&quot;, SSH-Tunnel tab: Tunnel via loopback and custom ssh server &quot;&lt;rpi-ip&gt;:22&quot;). There I set the ssh-startup command to be &quot;vncserver -localhost :1&quot; so that the vncserver starts right before vnc is being connected.</p> <p>Maybe this helps someone in the same situation or you have a bette
