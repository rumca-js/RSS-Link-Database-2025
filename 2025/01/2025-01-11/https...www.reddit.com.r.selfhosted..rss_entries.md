So far the ram and storage had been enough, but the CPU has not been fast enough for loading chunks, or maybe it is an storage speed issue, I am not entirely sure. Pre-generating can take a long time and lots of storage so that is hard to do. </p> <p>This Hetzner plan was deprecated so I am in need of something new.</p> <p>My budget is around 20€, I know this is not a lot, but I am in need

Here is my setup:</p> <p>I have my domain set to my public IP and proxied through Cloudflare (which is 80 and 443 traffic only) and then I have my router forwarding WAN port 25565 to my MC server internal IP and port 25565. </p> <p>What I don&#39;t understand is if this traffic is coming in through the Cloudflare proxy (which only allows 80 and 443), hitting my router (which only forwards requests on 25565) and then going to my MC server, how is this working? My assumption was this should not work because if someone tries to connect to my MC server from MC it shouldn&#39;t work because </p> <ol> <li><p>Cloudflare proxies are only 80/443</p></li> <li><p>My router is only forwarding port 25565.</p></li> </ol> <p>Could anyone who is more experienced in this clarify this for me?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been wanting to experiment with openwrt lately, and I have a mini pc that I don&#39;t use that often with two ethernet ports that I&#39;ve thought about installing open wrt with, but the specs seem a little too good for it to be just dedicated as a router. With an N95 processor, 16 gbs of ram, 512 gb m.2 storage, it seems like a lot of resources are going to sit idle, and I may not want two different machines, each drawing power, when one could work.</p> <p>I have thought about maybe installing proxmox on it and creating a vm with openwrt on it, or just installing docker on top of openwrt and allowing it to be a docker server. Has anyone done these things? I guess there might be valid reasons to just have your router be a router.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ottovonbizmarkie"> /u/ottovonbizmarkie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hz0du1/thinking_abo

Our site will list various games (just valheim and v rising for the moment) and curated dedicated servers for those games (hosted by community members). This way, you can see info about a server (its server settings, difficulty level, nomap mode, hardcore mode, when it last wiped, etc) and decide if you want to join that server.</p> <p>For curation, all servers listed on our site are curated by our mod team (just me atm). In order to end up on our site, you&#39;d need to provide a server that is different from another we host. IE, we could have a vanilla valheim server,
