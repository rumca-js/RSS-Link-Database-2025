This is the sixth season in a row in which he has been released on a free transfer as he has drifted from Real Madrid to the team currently 12th in the table, via Qatar, Greece and Brazil. The sense is of a waning career nearing its end.</p><p>And yet in those three and a half years since his last game for Everton, Rodr\u00edguez has played 32 times for Colombia.
