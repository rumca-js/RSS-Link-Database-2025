  <p id="0XIssD"><em>Marvel Snap</em> is back online in the US after access was cut off Saturday night due to the law that banned TikTok and other ByteDance-owned apps. The game’s current publisher, Nuverse, is owned by ByteDance.</p>
<p id="Jlp7Lh">In a post published Monday evening, the game’s developer, Second Dinner, <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881535498709266691">says that</a> it plans to bring “more services in-house” and “partner with a new publisher” to prevent a similar situation from happening again.
