<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I&#39;m just starting to get into fantasy, but I am an English Major with a concentration in 19th century British Lit. During my sophomore year I had to read a book called &#39;News From Nowhere&#39; by William Morris. It was utopian book, didn&#39;t care much either way for it. But recently I came across his Wikipedia page and realized that he wrote some of the early &quot;high&quot; fantasy prototypes, playing on ideas of romances and being one of the first, if not the first, writers to set a fantasy story in a different world. </p> <p>Has anyone read his books?

Fire Arrow came out back in 1998 and was apparently the last of the series.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TFL always gets recommended as one of the best grimdark around here and it was high on my priority list this year. Loved the first two books and I was very, very excited for the third one and in short, it blew me away.</p> <p>The Last Argument of Kings is in my top 3 books of all time now. The series progressively got better and better as it went with the finale being as perfect as it gets. Joe Abercrombie absolutely floored me with his fantastic prose, character work and everything else. I personally even loved the world, the history and mystique behind it which most people don&#39;t find that interesting. I get that the final message of the book is kinda bleak, but in this setting it makes so much sense. And the little hints and foreshadowing which we get throughout the entire series doesn&#39;t make it a subversion for the sake of subversion.</p> <p>All in all a brilliantly crafted trilogy and I can&#39;t wait to get to the rest of the books.</p>
