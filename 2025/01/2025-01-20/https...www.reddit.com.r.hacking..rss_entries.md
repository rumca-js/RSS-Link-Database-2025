<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If this isnt the correct subreddit, please remove it. My company had exfiltrated data from the Cleo hack by the CL0P gang back in October and they threatened to publish the data from 70ish companies, but ours was not one of them. I am stull curious if our data is out there and hoping someone can walk me through how to get to where the data would be. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trippin315"> /u/trippin315 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i62bld/looking_to_know_if_anyone_know_where_the_cl0p/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i62bld/looking_to_know_if_anyone_know_where_the_cl0p/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So far, the only idea that I&#39;ve come up with is purchasing 100 computers and/or phones and 100 SIM cards to keep it truly unique, but I would prefer to go for a cheaper and more automated system.</p> <p>I need to log into a website once a day, perform a single action (clicking a button after following a specific URL), log out, and then go into another unique account. I need to repeat this action hundreds or potentially thousands of times. Whether I use a PC or a phone is irrelevant. Both will work just as well.</p> <p>While I am aware that I can build a bot (selenium?) to perform the daily action, the masking of my identity, with 100 or more requests coming from the same PC, IP, ISP etc is what I&#39;m trying to avoid here. Ideally, my connection should look identical to that of a typical user who is only using one account.</p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/us

This morning a person sent me a (probably AI-generated) summary of my book, which really surprised me because it was able to nail <strong>exactly the core concepts</strong> I wanted to emphasize.</p> <p>In the hope that this can unlock your creativity and/or curiosity, I am sharing them here :)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hacking is a Creative Process</strong>: The book emphasizes that hacking is less about technical prowess and more about creativity and critical thinking. It&#39;s about seeing what others do not and approaching problems from unconventional angles​​.</li> <li><strong>Non-Linear Learning</strong>: Learning doesn&#39;t have to follow a set path. The hacker mindset involves a non-linear approach to acquiring knowledge, focusing on exploration, and connecting seemingly unrelated dots​​.</li> <li><strong>Tunnel Vision Can Be Dangerous</strong>: The book provides examples of how a narrow focus can
