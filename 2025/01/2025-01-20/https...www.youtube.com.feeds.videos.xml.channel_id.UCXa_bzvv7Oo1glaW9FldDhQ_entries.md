Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been receiving attention across the board before its launch on February 4th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Much of that is due to the increased scale, with double the quests, maps, and overall content over the original (which is already a sizable experience).

However, more and more previews have opened up about the improvements and features, particularly for the world. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 aims for a grounded depiction of 15th-century Bohemia. Extensive systems are in place to punish crimes and monitor your reputation, which can change depending on your clothing, whether you've bathed, etc.

Though all this only scratches the surface, it highlights how unique Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's world is over the original. What else is worth noting, and how does it stand out amid all the other big names this year? Find out here.

Based on all that we've seen of it so far, Avowed looks like it's going to have a few things in common with Skyrim, but at the same time, it's also setting itself apart in other key ways. Here, that's exactly what we'll be talking about.
