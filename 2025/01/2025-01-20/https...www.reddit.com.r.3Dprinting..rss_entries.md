<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I picked up a bambu machine for christmas, simply because on a base hardware and firmware side it was hard to find something that competed with them. Especially as it was my first printer.</p> <p>Because of everyone&#39;s warnings though, I have never allowed my machine to be connect to the internet and now never will allow. All prints go through the cold swappable SD card, no matter how much of a faff that is. My machine is mine, not Bambu&#39;s.</p> <p>Whilst it&#39;s not happened yet, it seems to be on the horizon so it&#39;s worth saying. My hammers don&#39;t charge me a subscription fee to use so like hell will I let my 3d printing tool charge me one.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who raised the alarm about bambu&#39;s potential. I think you might have just help one new user escape some of the lockdown. I look forward to upgrading to a Prusa (or damn near any other reasonable brand) in future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a
