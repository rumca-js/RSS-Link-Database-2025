<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im probably over thinking this but its 4am and im stumped. I am making a point of sale web app for a user that do hourly/minute rentals. I need to have up to 50 count down timers that can be modified on the fly. Ex: lets say you rent for 2 hours but decide later you wanna add a half hour. How can i make sure that the changes are saved to the DB but also display on the front end accordingly as the page can be refreshed. Im really stuck on what the best way to do timers is. Note in my models.py for rentals I have rental.start_time rental.duration rental.end_time and finally rental.set_time (meaning the user set a countdown at somepoint but this can also be added on or taken off at anypoint.) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RajaBule"> /u/RajaBule </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1i61ta2/timer_questions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
