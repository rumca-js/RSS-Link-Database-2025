People with the skin condition psoriasis often have invisible inflammation in the small intestine with an increased propensity for 'leaky gut', according to new research. These changes in the gut could explain why psoriasis sufferers often have gastrointestinal problems and are more prone to developing Crohn's disease.

A new study has described a phenomenon researchers refer to as 'contagious urinations.' The study in 20 captive chimpanzees living at the Kumamoto Sanctuary in Japan shows that, when one chimp pees, others are more likely to follow.

## Scientists uncover structure of critical component in deadly Nipah virus

Researchers have profiled the molecular structure and features of a key part of the deadly Nipah virus. Experiments in cells showe how changes in the viral polymerase -- a protein involved in viral replication -- can alter the virus's ability to make copies of itself and infect cells. Further analysis revealed parts of the Nipah virus polymerase that may render the pathogen susceptible to drugs.

## Ancient viral DNA shapes early embryo development

Over half of our genomes consists of thousands of remnants of ancient viral DNA, known as transposable elements, which are widespread across the tree of life. Once dismissed as the 'dark side' of the genome, researchers have now revealed their crucial role in early embryo development.

## New study paves way for immunotherapies tailored for childhood cancers
