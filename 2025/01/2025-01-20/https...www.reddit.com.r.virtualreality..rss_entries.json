I got a quest 3 for christmas and I&#39;ve been having a blast with standalone games, but I&#39;d like to dive into PCVR games as well. Problem is, the few games I tried, run very poorly - either with very bad graphics or very bad performance. As such, I conclude that my computer is not the best for VR, and needs to upgrade.</p> <p>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X &quot;Zen 3&quot; 6-Core 3.7GHz c/ Turbo 4.6GHz 35MB Cache SktAM4</p> <p>GPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 3060 XC Gaming 12GB GDDR6</p> <p>RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB (AMD Expo) 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5-5600MHz CL36</p> <p>Motherboard: ATX MSI MPG B550 Gaming Plus SktAM4</p> <p>PSU: Nox Hummer X 1000W 80 PLUS Gold Edition Full Modular</p> <p>From what I gathered online, I should upgrade CPU and GPU; but everyone recommends upgrading to 7800x3d or higher, and 4080 or higher, which gets really expensive. I&#39;ve also seen recommendations for ryzen 5 7600x, would that be viable in the mid-long term?</p> </div",

Once again it recognizes it but it keeps going on and off.</p> <p>Example: i connect the cable using the powered usb hub, pc recognizes it, after 5 seconds it stops and makes a static noise, then recognizes again, then stops with static sound. This is an endless loop and i can&#39;t seem to fix it.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried:</p> <ol> <li><p>2 different powered usb hubs.</p></li> <li><p>usb 3.0 to usb c</p></li> <li><p>tried on laptop and headset worked.</p></li> </ol> <p>Motherboard: asrock b650m-hd",

I got this Meta Quest, not this last Christmas but the Christmas before that, and last year my sister had played with it. She left it out and my dog chewed it up. No damage to the exterior cameras or sensors but the plastic face plate did come off. Now when I turn it on, the meta logo displays, does the sound and animation, gives me three loading dots for a few seconds, and then turns into a dark grey/almost black screen. After a few seconds in the screen it automatically powers off. I have had it sitting in my room for 6-8 months now because I couldn\u2019t find a fix. I\u2019m trying to find either a cheap repair shop or have a fix at home. ANY information would be helpful at this point. Thank you all!</p> <p>TL;DR Meta Quest 3 got chewed up by my dog and now displays a black screen. Looking for help. Or info.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",

But if this not a purpose currently meant for modern headsets, why focus on something like Google Maps XR? </p> <p>Unless they do have some plans for such progression. But main issue IMO with this, is the lack of internet/data outside Home Wifi, unless using a hotspot. Many features would need internet outside the home to use to full value.
