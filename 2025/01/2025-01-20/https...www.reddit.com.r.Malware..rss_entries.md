<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a maleware I don&#39;t think; But somehow someone got in his account. It was definitely a bot or someone using a bot because it started spamming discord links to friends and discords. </p> <p>I came here to post this because the funny and interesting, also ironic thing they are using a security feature against him. By enabling a passkey on his account he can&#39;t do anything to alter his account. Will a passkey override/conflict with 2FA? I am worried in case something like this happens to me in the future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InfiniteFloof1"> /u/InfiniteFloof1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i5m540/friends_discord_got_hacked/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i5m540/friends_discord_got_hacked/">[comments]</a></span>
