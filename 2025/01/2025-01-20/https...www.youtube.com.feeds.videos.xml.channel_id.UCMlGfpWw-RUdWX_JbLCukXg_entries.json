The project provides a) a simple way for engineers to evaluate standard library proposal implementations, b) a high quality template for standard library authors to share their implementations, and c) a modern platform for the wider C++ community to discuss standard proposals.\n\nWe'll discuss the problems the Beman Project is addressing, how it came about, and, most importantly, how to get involved. At the end of this talk you'll feel equipped to build and test proposed standard libraries, provide feedback, and, perhaps, contribute some implementations yourself!\n\nThe Beman Project is named in memory of Beman Dawes, the much loved co-founder of Boost.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/The_Beman_",
