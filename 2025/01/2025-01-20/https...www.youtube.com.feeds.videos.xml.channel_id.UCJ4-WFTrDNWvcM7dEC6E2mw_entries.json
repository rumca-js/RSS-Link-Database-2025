Get the game with our affiliate link https://links.malediction.gg/pott-gamefound and you too can battle for powerful relics while helping the channel.\n\nA Tabletop game with deck building and miniatures, Malediction is a new game from Loot Studios. They sponsored us to give the game a go and we are glad they did because Mubin and JT had a ton of fun playing it. While the game can be played with the cardboard stands included in the box sets, we printed the STLs and got to enjoy painting the miniatures too.\n\nNow, since we have not had the game for very long we did make some rules mistakes. Just means we need to play it more. We want to play it more.\n\nMB01OGQJOP9SDJK",
