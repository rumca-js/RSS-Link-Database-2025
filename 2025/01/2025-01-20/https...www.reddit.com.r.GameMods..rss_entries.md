<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This may be a be a longshot but...I&#39;m pretty new to mods in general and I&#39;m currently using Reloaded II for this mod that mutes Gallica during battles, but the zip folder I downloaded doesn&#39;t do anything when I drop it into Reloaded II as instructed? <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metaphorrefantazio/mods/11?tab=description&amp;BH=4">This is the mod</a> I&#39;m referring to by the way. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/daringderek"> /u/daringderek </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i64gd0/help_with_this_mute_gallica_mod_for_metaphor/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i64gd0/help_with_this_mute_gallica_mod_for_metaphor/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies if wrong sub. I’d like to seek out a modder who’s willing to write me a cheat table for Tenchu Z. On top of the freecam I’d also like to turn off that horrible motion blur that occurs every time a stealth kill’s performed. Last but not least I’d also like to be able to spawn more enemies on a stage. For this I offer an even 100 euros/dollars. For common sense and mutual protection, I’d like to propose this: If you accept all I request from you BEFORE payment is a proof of concept ie. a short video for example that you send me proving the table works. Not the cheat table itself. Only AFTER I paid you do I request it. DM me if interested!</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SorbetAsleep"> /u/SorbetAsleep </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i61ves/tenchu_z_freecam_commission/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameM
