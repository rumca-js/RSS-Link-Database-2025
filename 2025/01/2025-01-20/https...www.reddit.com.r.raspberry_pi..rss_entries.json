Then the screen disconnected. </p> <p>Not sure what is happening. Is my board beyond repair? I checked to see if anything was bent on the board. It doesn&#39;t look like it. I took the board out of the box, restarted it, plugged the board in to the different HDMI slots.

The image was created on a Raspberry Pi 4. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have the budget to purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 module, so I\u2019m exploring options to virtualize the image using QEMU.</p> <p>However, I\u2019ve faced numerous errors while attempting this.</p> <p>As an alternative, I created a new Raspberry Pi OS from scratch and mounted the image file onto it. This allowed me to access the <code>boot</code> and <code>rootfs</code> directories. My goal was to analyze the code contained in the image to identify areas for improvement or provide suggestions.</p> <p>Could you guide me on whether virtualizing this image with QEMU is feasible, and if so, what steps I should take?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/newNormalGUY_69\"> /u/newNormalGUY_69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
