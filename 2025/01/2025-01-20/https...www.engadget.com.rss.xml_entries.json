While many people view these devices as their own niche, they\u2019re ultimately still headphones, just with a boom mic and some fancy branding attached. While the general quality of dedicated headsets has improved over time, they still tend to cost more compared to a good pair of wired headphones (which, yes, still exist). If you need to chat with friends, you can always buy a microphone separately and get superior sound quality there as well.<br><br>That said, we understand that many people just want the convenience of a headset with a mic built right in. So after testing dozens of contenders over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve rounded up a few commendable gaming headsets and headphones that work well for gaming. As you\u2019ll see, the two aren\u2019t quite the same thing. Whichever way you go, though, all of our picks should make your game time more enjoyable, no matter which platform you use, and whether you p",
