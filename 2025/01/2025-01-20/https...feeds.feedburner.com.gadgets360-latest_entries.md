Early pterosaurs featured long tails ending in leaf-shaped vanes, supported by a sophisticated tensioning system. This system, revealed through laser-stimulated fluorescence analysis of fossils, included criss-crossing fibres and tube-like structures that provided stiffness. These tails served a dual purpose: aiding flight by stabilising the vanes and playing a role in display behaviours, such as attracting mates. Over time, evolutionary adaptations saw tail lengths significantly reduced, improving flight manoeuvrability. Researchers noted the intricate internal structures and the balance between aerodynamic functionality and display appeal.
