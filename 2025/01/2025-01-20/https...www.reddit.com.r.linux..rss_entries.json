I would like to use arch as a base distro. As the device is quite old and performance limited, my thought was to run just the Xserver with the jar, but the application itself has not OSK.

In that time I managed to run into a considerable amount of bugs and errors (very likely due to faults of mine).</p> <p>How should I go about picking a laptop that will have little to no issues with Linux? I like the Thinkpad line of laptops, and I&#39;d probably rather stick to it. I enjoyed using Debian and Fedora, I had issues with Ubuntu and Mint. Is there a short checklist that can be devised for making the task of choosing a new device easier?</p> <p>The bugs and errors I mentioned earlier on were mostly wifi, bluetooth, touchpad, usb device and gpu related. So, in general, driver errors. I spent a lot of my time trying to fix these bugs (often to no avail); time that I could have used for greater things.</p> <p>I&#39;m eager to hear what your advice ",

I got an RTX 3060 ti. and 2 monitors (Shows up on 1 monitor) I also don&#39;t get any problems when doing any type of gaming (low load and high load) and everything else seems to work fine just that so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a dying GPU.</p> <p>Also using Cachy os if that helps</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m5ey156yl1ee1.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7bb55e89b7d9ddea1624bba61bad53cca9ae4aa\">https://preview.redd.it/m5ey156yl1ee1.png?width=3024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7bb55e89b7d9ddea1624bba61bad53cca9ae4aa</a></p> <p>Any help is welcomed :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ItsHotdogFred\"> /u/I",
