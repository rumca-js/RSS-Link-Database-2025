<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I was wondering if anyone wanted to do an experiment and get to know each other. </p> <p>I love to read boks, but even more I like being read to. Storytelling has been around since the dawn of time. Stories like the Odyssey and the Epic of Gilgamesh were first told around fires. People like William Shakespeare were orators first and he never intended for people simply to read his plays. Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, and other authors were equally as famous for reading their work as for writing it. </p> <p>I often see people scorn audio books and say they are not real reading. Some of my fondest memories are of my parents reading novels with me. </p> <p>So my challenge to you is pick a novel or collection of short stories and I will do the same and we can take turns reading to one another. </p> <p>I hope you always find someone to enjoy books together with instead of it being a solitary hobby.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by

## (no spoilers) Just finished "When Among Crows" by Veronica Roth, it was a good read!

I&#39;ve gotten a couple great recs from here (<em>The Buried Giant</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro was excellent). One of my new year&#39;s resolutions is to utilize the public library system where I live more and, I picked up <em>When Among Crows</em> from the new fiction section at the branch near my house. 160 pages, cool cover, let&#39;s give it a shot!</p> <p>It was a good read! Engaging story set in a fantastical modern-day Chicago. The mythology was well placed and I think Roth towed the line between fantasy and realistic well. A lot of these books feel like of cheesy, but I though Roth&#39;s storytelling worked really well. Also, a HUGE plus in my opinion is that it&#39;s 160 pages; nice and succinct. The pacing didn&#39;t feel rushed or longwinded, which, let&#39;s be r

## Book separated in two parts

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My friend and I are having a silly discussion regarding a book being separated into two parts. If the publisher decides to separate the book into two (or more) parts, like The Way of Kings and A Count of Monte Cristo, do you count them as one or two books? If you count books read, it is one or two books. Also, if you count how many books you own, you count them as one or two.</p> <p>For me, if the author intended for it to be one book, then I count it as one even if I read/have it physically in two parts. My friend counts it as one when counting books read, but as two when counting how many books she owns.</p> <p>I am interesting to hear what others think about this, if you think about it at all lol</p> <p>Edit spelling</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoo-24289"> /u/Snoo-24289 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i5whv2/book_separated_in_two_parts/">[link]</a></span

## The fact that Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson was published in 1992 is positively mind-boggling (No Spoilers)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finished <em>Snow Crash</em> last night and I&#39;m honestly still reeling. The level of detail used to describe the internet, and the associated VR/AR technology used in the story, this work could have been written today and still been fully believable/technologically sound. Of course, it&#39;s still sci-fi and there&#39;s plenty of other technology which is not (or at least not yet) applicable to the modern world, but still.</p> <p>The prose also holds up exceptionally well. Language evolves a lot over 30+ years, but the characters all speak in a way that still feels authentic today, and in my opinion the same can be said for the narrative bits. Usually the older works of sci-fi that I&#39;ve read thus far which hold up the best on a modern level are those which take place in an intangible setting, <em>Dune</em> comes to mind. Published in the 60s, but due to its setting being an entirely different planet and also incorporating a level of magic/s

You remember any lyrics or even the tone, in 2025, you’ll be able to find the song you can’t remember.</p> <p>But books? There’s 200,000 released every year and there’s a very good chance, even if you bought it a big shelf book store, that you and maybe 500 other people on the planet read that book.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Read Lev Grossman&#39;s follow up to the Magicians in the area of adult fantasy - The Bright Sword: An Arthurian Novel - in one sitting yesterday and it did not disappoint. </p> <p>Set in a mythical Camelot era Britain, Lev&#39;s writing paints the feeling of it into your mind as successfully as The Magicians did. As a huge fan of his writing with a lifelong attachment to Arthurian lore and mythology I enjoyed the book very much. Cute references to his own internal mythology echo from The Magicians - and many of the same themes resound - but with a tone closer to a spirit that has travelled Quentin&#39;s journey already in a past life and bears those lessons somewhere deep inside. </p> <p>Wondering if anyone else hear has read it and would like to discuss it. Also would be open to discussing other Arthurian works and the overall mythology - I was obsessed with the genre as a kid and still enjoy it very much to this day.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished reading Intermezzo by Sally Rooney and it&#39;s easily my favourite so far. I feel like Rooney’s writing has evolved with each book, to the point where her last one, <em>Beautiful World</em>, had these introspective conversations the characters had with themselves, which I really loved. To my delight, Intermezzo had plenty of that for me to dig into.</p> <p>I’m not exactly sure what to call this writing style but I love the web of thoughts her characters go through, moving between philosophy, psychology, economics and whatnot. That commentary feels very real and engaging.</p> <p>Now coming back to the book, it’s a delicate story of grief, love, and interpersonal struggles. The premise is of two brothers in the aftermath of losing a parent. Having read her work before I was kinda expecting this one to be a bit traumatic, but I feel like it’s her happiest one yet. But of course, the whole novel still carries these subtle, touching current
