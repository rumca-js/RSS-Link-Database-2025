<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>Iâ€™m currently trying to balance my cybersecurity learning between solving rooms on platforms like TryHackMe/HTB and studying theoretical concepts (e.g., topics like OWASP Top 10 or web application pentesting guides).</p> <p>I wanted to ask:</p> <pre><code>1. How many rooms/challenges do you think is ideal to solve per day for steady progress? Should I aim for a specific number, or is it better to focus on quality and fully understanding the concepts behind each room? 2. Would you recommend splitting time evenly between practical challenges and theory, or should I prioritize one over the other at certain stages of learning? </code></pre> <p>Iâ€™m looking to build strong foundational skills but also want to be efficient and avoid burnout. Iâ€™d love to hear how you approach balancing these two aspects of learning!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlarmImpos
