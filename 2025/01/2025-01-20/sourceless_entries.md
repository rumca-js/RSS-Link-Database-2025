LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -The dollar drifted lower and stocks were cautiously positive on Monday as investors awaited an expected flurry of policy announcements during the first hours of Donald Trump's second presidency and eyed a rate hike in Japan at the end of the week.  Trump takes the oath of office at noon Eastern Time (1700 GMT), and promised a "brand new day of American strength" at a rally on Sunday.  Monday is a U.S. holiday, so the first responses to his inauguration in financial markets may be felt in foreign exchange and then during Asian trade on Tuesday.

Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth $16.4 billion by 70%, and it had reached an "understanding" with a lender group.

Vivendi management and bosses of some of its newly spun out companies - Canal+, Havas and Louis Hachette Group - need to lay out more clearly their strategies to convince investors the break-up was worth it, analysts and investors said.  The spin-offs in December, backed by the Bollore family, split Vivendi into four multi-billion-euro companies in a bid to unlock value as the French media conglomerate's overall market capitalisation was estimated to be less than the sum of its parts.  But some of the standalone companies had a weak start,  triggered in part by a lack of information about strategy, some disappointing financial guidance and uncertainty around pay-TV group Canal+'s acquisition of broadcaster MultiChoice, the analysts and investors said.

Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio's "All Weather" is a volatility-mitigating, multi-asset strategy that helped shield its Chinese clients from the brunt of the Sino-U.S. trade war during Trump's first term.  The highly sought-after Bridgewater onshore China strategy eclipsed most rival hedge fund products last year with an eye-popping 37% return.

The Bank of Japan is expected to raise interest rates on Friday barring any market shocks when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office, a move that would lift short-term borrowing costs to levels unseen since the 2008 global financial crisis.  A tightening in policy would underscore the central bank's resolve to steadily push up interest rates, now at 0.25%, to near 1% - a level analysts see as neither cooling nor overheating Japan's economy.  At the two-day meeting ending on Friday, the BOJ is likely to raise its short-term policy rate to 0.5% unless Trump's inaugural speech and executive orders upend financial markets, sources have told Reuters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization on Monday against what it said was China's "unfair and illegal" practice of setting worldwide royalty rates for EU standard essential patents without the patent owner's consent.  The Commission, which oversees the trade policy of the 27-nation European Union, said China had empowered its courts to set worldwide rates for high-tech EU companies, notably in the telecoms sector.  "This pressures innovative European high-tech companies into lowering their rates on a worldwide basis, thus giving Chinese manufacturers cheaper access to those European technologies unfairly," it said in a statement.

Tariffs expected to be imposed by incoming President Donald Trump will probably not be as punishing as most expect, Walsh said, as long as the dollar remains strong as the reserve currency and the U.S. continues to attract capital.
