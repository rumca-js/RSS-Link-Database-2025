<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It was kind of set up like the online version of a magazine, with articles, and news regarding things like &quot;this neat new toolkit for xyz&quot; or OPSEC, white hats vs grey hats vs black hats, etc.. I discovered it and immediately, a few of the article topics had me instantly fully interested on the possibilities of the internet. </p> <p>I know for certain it wasn&#39;t HackerNews. I remember the home page was a bit more lively than HN, and less sterile. I know I&#39;m not giving you guys much to go on here, but I can&#39;t remember the site name for the life of me, and when an old hazy memory of browsing neat tech stuff late at night popped into my head, it was a core memory, and I&#39;d like to see if I can find it again. </p> <p>Any ideas? TIA! ‚úåüèº</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AcidTraffik"> /u/AcidTraffik </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i5jizi/lookin
