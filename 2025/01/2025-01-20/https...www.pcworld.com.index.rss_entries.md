<p>A new year means another tax season—and all the associated headaches. Not just navigating the byzantine maze of US tax code, but dodging related scams, too.</p>



<p>One particular tax scam is especially thorny since it can happen right under your nose. In an attempt to collect a refund, a fraudster files a tax return in your name. But you won’t know it until you go to file yourself and discover a mess to untangle. The risk of this happening is higher in 2025 too after last year’s repeated data breaches. At this point, most everyone’s personal information (including social security numbers) is findable somewhere on the dark web.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the IRS makes this kind of scam easy to block. On the agency’s website, you can request an <em>identity protection PIN</em>, a six-digit numeric string that you must add to your filing. It identifies your ta

<p>I don’t know about you, but working on multiple devices at once makes me feel like some kind of 90s hacker. I’m programming on my PC, answering emails on my laptop, responding to chat messages on my tablet, all while transferring files on my <em>other</em> PC.</p>



<p>But while that whole process is <em>cool</em>, it’s certainly not <em>efficient</em>. Jumping from keyboard to keyboard to keyboard, getting mixed up between mice and touchpads, and being forced to use those shallow 2-in-1 laptop keyboards… it’s too messy and chaotic for me.</p>



<p>What if there was a better way? What if you could use a single keyboard and mouse for <em>all</em> of your devices, switching from PC to laptop to tablet back to PC with a single button? Well, you can! The solution is a nifty accessory called a KVM switch.</p>

<p>You may have heard the news about the PowerSchool breach—hackers breaking into a software system that helps schools keep track of student data, then demanding a ransom in exchange for not leaking the information. Depending on the school and its data storage practices, the student data stolen can include social security numbers, in addition to names, addresses, and birth dates.</p>



<p>Bad actors having your child’s name and social security number is a risk with potential far-reaching consequences. Scammers can trash their ability to open a credit card, get a bank account, land a job, or secure an apartment. And since most people don’t expect a child to be targeted this way, the damage often has long set in by the time it’s discovered.</p>



<p>You can take protective measures as your child’s guardian, though. Three steps will help safeguard their financ
