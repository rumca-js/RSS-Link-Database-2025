The nerves faded after Marc Cucurella restored the advantage after an hour. Authority returned and although this was far from Chelsea\u2019s most stylish win of the season, a final score of 3-1 was enough to capitalise on Newcastle\u2019s setback against Bournemouth and see Maresca\u2019s side take fourth place off Manchester City before they visit the champions on Saturday.</p> <a href=",

Leon Goretzka breaking a game open for Bayern Munich in his own special way doesn\u2019t feel like it should be headline news but it is, and it was a timely intervention for the Bundesliga leaders on a rare quiet day for Harry Kane.</p><p>On a day when Wolfsburg were what they rarely are on visits to the Allianz Arena \u2013 a genuine irritant \u2013 and when Kane wasn\u2019t able to bail Bayern out, they needed some practical rigour to see them over the line, and Goretzka provided it. Not predictably so, however. Having once been one of the avowed cornerstones of present and future Bayern, Goretzka is in the unusual position of having to prove himself all over again, though not necessarily to his current employers.</p> <a href=\"htt",

You probably don\u2019t get asked that question very often. And yet, the characteristic smell of a place seems to contain its special essence. Photos can\u2019t truly bring back the feeling of being there, but smell has that power.</p><p>Our sense of smell develops before we\u2019re born, and it is strongly linked to brain centres associated with creating new memories and perceiving emotions and&nbsp;bodily sensations. As a result, smells can merge these together, forming vividly personal memories. Most of us have smells that act as a trigger, transporting us to another time and place; for some it is the ocean breeze in summer, for others it might be urban smells of coffee houses, exhaust fumes or a hot pavement on a sunny day.

At about six miles above the Earth\u2019s surface there is a strong circulation known as the polar vortex around the north pole, which usually helps to keep cold air trapped there. However, late last week and early this week the circulation has been weakening and meandering, allowing a cold plume of air to be brought in from the north. Temperatures across central and eastern parts of the US are forecast to be 10-15C below average, with New York likely to see temperatures struggling to get out of negative double digits during daytime.

It\u2019s a violent British revenge thriller starring ex-Marine (and Jeff Bridges lookalike) Tip Cullen as a veteran getting payback for the death of his teenage daughter from drugs. Everyone involved has clearly worked extremely hard with what looks like a very low budget, but the cracks do show; it\u2019s impossible to take a gangland crime boss seriously when he\u2019s wearing such a nasty cheap suit. To be fair, most of the funding looks like it\u2019s been chucked at SUVs and imitation assault rifles for the relentless gunfights.</p><p>As it happens, veteran marine Andy (Cullen) carries out his first kills using bits and bobs borrowed from work; he\u2019s the manager of a hardware shop so he picks off the bad guys in a seedy drug den with a staple gun a",
