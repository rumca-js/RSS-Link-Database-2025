I discovered it and immediately, a few of the article topics had me instantly fully interested on the possibilities of the internet. </p> <p>I know for certain it wasn&#39;t HackerNews. I remember the home page was a bit more lively than HN, and less sterile. I know I&#39;m not giving you guys much to go on here, but I can&#39;t remember the site name for the life of me, and when an old hazy memory of browsing neat tech stuff late at night popped into my head, it was a core memory, and I&#39;d like to see if I can find it again. </p> <p>Any ideas?
