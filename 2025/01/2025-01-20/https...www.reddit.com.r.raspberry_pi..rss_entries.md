<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried to turn on my Raspberry Pi 4 today. I just got done setting up a server box for all my networking equipment. I plugged it into the TV, which I normally do. This time, the screen showed missing and moving pixels of different colors. Then it booted up just went black, with a mouse icon showing. Then the screen disconnected. </p> <p>Not sure what is happening. Is my board beyond repair? I checked to see if anything was bent on the board. It doesn&#39;t look like it. I took the board out of the box, restarted it, plugged the board in to the different HDMI slots. Nothing works. </p> <p>Want to figure out if I need to throw it out and get another one, or if I am missing something.</p> <p>Any help appreciated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good day,</p> <p>I wanted to ask if it’s possible to virtualize an IoT device image that was given to me by my supervisor. The image was created on a Raspberry Pi 4. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have the budget to purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 module, so I’m exploring options to virtualize the image using QEMU.</p> <p>However, I’ve faced numerous errors while attempting this.</p> <p>As an alternative, I created a new Raspberry Pi OS from scratch and mounted the image file onto it. This allowed me to access the <code>boot</code> and <code>rootfs</code> directories. My goal was to analyze the code contained in the image to identify areas for improvement or provide suggestions.</p> <p>Could you guide me on whether virtualizing this image with QEMU is feasible, and if so, what steps I should take?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/newNormalGUY_69"> /u/newNormalGUY_69 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red
