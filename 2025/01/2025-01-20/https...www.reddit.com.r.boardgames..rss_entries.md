<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was recently inpatient for a few weeks and hospitals are boring! So I could use some suggestions for this kind of thing for the future, and also thought I’d pass on suggestions in case others run into this. </p> <p>If you are not aware, most hospital rooms have only one table: a tray that goes across the bed for the patient. It is approximately as long as the bed is across, and 18-24” wide (I’m not exactly sure). So no games with big boards and any sort of player tableau work well. They have to be small, or at least small-ish. </p> <p><em>Normally</em> my personal preference runs to games like Terraforming Mars or Spirit Island. Neither would work here. </p> <p>We have found the following games to be pretty good. Not all of them are great games, but they pass the time and have a variety of skill levels, thus they work with a variety of visitors.</p> <ul> <li>trick taking card games (euchre, rook)</li> <li>rummy-style card games (phase 10, player li

My spouse has played base game with me two times recently, after delaying because of concerns that it would be too complicated. My spouse has had a decent amount of fun playing the game, with the caveat of feeling hopeless at a certain point because it’s clear that I’m going to win by a wide margin. I’m by no means an excellent player, nor am I intentionally running up my score. My spouse had even said that the game is fun, but that the right moves don’t seem to “click”. </p> <p>I noticed, while looking through the rule book for Missing Expedition, that there is an “easy mode” for newer players. Would this be an effective way for my spouse to learn the game flow and even improve skill level?

## I sold Castles of Burgundy without ever playing it

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just needed to share with a community that I hope will be sympathetic with my feeling of loss. I bought Castles of Burgundy about 8 years ago with high hopes of it being a marquee game with my group. We pulled it out and set it up a few times, but for some reason I could never finish walking them through all the instructions. So we&#39;d pack it up and play a different game. After that happened the fourth or fifth time, it became a joke and then the joke reinforced the lack of desire to play, I think. </p> <p>So a month ago, I acknowledged defeat. I sold the game. Zero plays. I was so hopeful. It feels like a loss. Even if we could have played it once, I could have found out what the flow of the game was like, but it didn&#39;t work out. It just feels sad.</p> <p>Thanks for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/torontuh_gosh"> /u/torontuh_gosh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

We love the idea of it but we have been wildly unsuccessful every time we have played. </p> <p>Every time we have an assassin and a witness it’s so unbalanced. The assassin has a leg up because they know the dynamic, and the witness doesn’t stand a chance because they are fighting for their life to survive all the incidences and opposition. The assassin doesn’t have to do anything to out themselves as the assassin because of how dangerous all the oppositions and incidences are. Then at the end of the game they can just pound the witness with wounds practically out of no where. </p> <p>TLDR: the game feels extremely unbalanced and too dangerous. There assassin barely has to do anything to be in an advantage the entire game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Plane_Profession3344"> /u/Plane_Profession3344 </a> <br/

## If there was a card game (think magic the gathering) that was inspired by Command and conquer, would you be interested in playing it?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently played through command and conquer 3 and got my gears turning about how to make this into a competitive card game kinda like magic the gathering. I got the rules and an mvp up and running (it plays okay but still very rough) - this is actually the farthest I’ve gotten in a game design. </p> <p>In essence, it’s a tableau builder/deck builder that plays kinda similar to magic the gathering. You construct units/buildings by collecting Tiberium, assemble them into squads that then move about a randomized terrain map (also cards). Minimum of 2 players but up to 3 total (You can play as either GDI, Nod, or Scrin). </p> <p>Curious to hear if this type of game/theme is appealing to others. Note- not trying to make money off this. Just trying to convert a video game I love into a style of card game that seems fun. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Murky-Valuable3844"> /u/Murky-Valuable3844 </a>

A coop boardgame for 4-8 players with a traitor mechanic, some clackity dice, and that can take around 2 hours to play. </p> <p>I&#39;m open to themes and genres. It doesn&#39;t have to be based on a film, and it would be nice if it fit in the boot of my car.</p> <p><em>immediate footnote</em> someone will probably suggest Nemisis, because that game is awesome and has similar mechanics. <strong>No!</strong> I do not need Nemisis in my life.

Hara could be called a younger sibling of Mage Knight: not nearly as heavy weight, much more friendly rules and session length. It is based on hand management, too, however here bottom effects of actions cards can be used not by empowering cards for mana, but the next turn after using it: cards rotate, so you can plan what to do ahead. There are several modes (scenarios - sadly there is very limited number for each character) - coop/competitive/solo - to choose from as well,</p> <p>Hara has depth, too - not as much, of course - too. And wonderfully illustrated thematic (sadly extremely rare) dreamworld setting. As well as characters (which by the way are much more unique than in MK), monsters, locations, bosses... Everything looks so beautiful.</p> <p>On the other hand, Hara is much more random than MK - mainly due to mechanics of world shifting, which can really screw your plans, but ther

To be clear, I&#39;ve never actually played any of the Metal Gear Solid games, so it was kinda like if the gameplay sucked, then there wasn&#39;t any grace to be given because I was a fan. So anyways, the game comes with a full campaign that follows the story of the original MSG, and 6 bonus missions. The campaign starts as single player, but as you meet new characters in the story, more players can join the game. There&#39;s equipment that you can collect permanently as level rewards, and you can choose which equipment to bring in for any specific level. Stealth levels are fun, and you have to determine what path you can take to stay out of the guards&#39; sight, while also moving
