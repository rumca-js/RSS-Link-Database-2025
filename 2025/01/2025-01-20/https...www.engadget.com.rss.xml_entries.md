## The best gaming headsets for 2025

<p>Sometimes, the best gaming headset doesn’t need to be a “gaming headset” at all. While many people view these devices as their own niche, they’re ultimately still headphones, just with a boom mic and some fancy branding attached. While the general quality of dedicated headsets has improved over time, they still tend to cost more compared to a good pair of wired headphones (which, yes, still exist). If you need to chat with friends, you can always buy a microphone separately and get superior sound quality there as well.<br><br>That said, we understand that many people just want the convenience of a headset with a mic built right in. So after testing dozens of contenders over the past couple of years, we’ve rounded up a few commendable gaming headsets and headphones that work well for gaming. As you’ll see, the two aren’t quite the same thing. Whichever way you go, though, all of our picks should make your game time more enjoyable, no matter which platform you use, and whether you p

<p>There are really two types of ereaders: Dedicated ebook/audiobook devices or slabs that are more akin to small tablets with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html">E Ink</a> screens.

Ereaders in the latter group include entries from Onyx Boox, PocketBook and a couple of smaller companies. <br><br>Of course, any smartphone or tablet can act as an ereader, but for our purposes, we focused on devices with paper-like, E Ink screens.
