Still, the communication between the *arrs and Jackett only seems to work if I open the Jackett port (9117).

Like taking 5-10 minutes to move 1 GB from one drive to another. To be more precise, its fine, until I go to transfer more than 50-100 GB of data, at which point the whole thing grinds to a halt, and stays that way until I reboot the system. At which point it works fine again for a while, until I transfer 50-100 GB of data, at which point it again grinds to a halt. Rinse, repeat.</p> <p>For reference, the particular machine I&#39;m running is a Dell Poweredge R720, which uses an h710 mini for hardware raid, to which I have several western digital (2.5 inch, blue) SSDs plugged in, set to Raid 5.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been trying to diagnose what the problem could be, but have come up completely empty. My first thought was that maybe some docker process was clogging up the machine. But even when I stop all (two) of the docker containers on the machine, the problem persists.</p",
