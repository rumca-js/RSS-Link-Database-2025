They had all played the game before but it was my first time. I went over the rules and they let me take back some actions so I thought i was doing fine up until the bank break. After the bank broke the first time I realized how fucked I was. I ended up with approx $150 compared to $300 and even ~$600 from the winner. That being said i did enjoy the game albeit this was the first game I felt this out of my depth playing. I will hopefully do better next time but I also wanted to know how yalls first fcm game went or if you&#39;ve ever struggled this much with your firsts game of something before.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CbfDetectedLoser\"> /u/CbfDetectedLoser </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i5wj58/first_time_playing_food_chain_magnate/\">[link]</a><",

I bought Castles of Burgundy about 8 years ago with high hopes of it being a marquee game with my group. We pulled it out and set it up a few times, but for some reason I could never finish walking them through all the instructions. So we&#39;d pack it up and play a different game. After that happened the fourth or fifth time, it became a joke and then the joke reinforced the lack of desire to play, I think. </p> <p>So a month ago, I acknowledged defeat. I sold the game. Zero plays. I was so hopeful. It feels like a loss. Even if we could have played it once, I could have found out what the flow of the game was like, but it didn&#39;t work out.

The assassin has a leg up because they know the dynamic, and the witness doesn\u2019t stand a chance because they are fighting for their life to survive all the incidences and opposition. The assassin doesn\u2019t have to do anything to out themselves as the assassin because of how dangerous all the oppositions and incidences are.

You construct units/buildings by collecting Tiberium, assemble them into squads that then move about a randomized terrain map (also cards).

To be clear, I&#39;ve never actually played any of the Metal Gear Solid games, so it was kinda like if the gameplay sucked, then there wasn&#39;t any grace to be given because I was a fan. So anyways, the game comes with a full campaign that follows the story of the original MSG, and 6 bonus missions. The campaign starts as single player, but as you meet new characters in the story, more players can join the game. There&#39;s equipment that you can collect permanently as level rewards, and you can choose which equipment to bring in for any specific level. Stealth levels are fun, and you have to determine what path you can take to stay out of the guards&#39; sight, while also moving ",
