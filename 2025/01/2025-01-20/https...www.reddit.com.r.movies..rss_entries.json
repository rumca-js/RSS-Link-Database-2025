I&#39;m sure there are a bunch of horror films, but I really struggle to think of any other films that play this completely straight - usually if it ends with the protagonist losing then they made a mistake somewhere along the line.</p> <p>I&#39;d exclude biopics and movies in series from this as they are part of a larger story (eg: Empire Strikes Back ends with Han being frozen and Luke losing to Vader, but you know it&#39;s only the middle of the story) </p> <p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing obvious ones but one of the only examples I can think of is actually Don&#39;t Look Up, where the main characters are correct, try to warn everyone, do it as well as they can... but it doesn&#39;t make any difference.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/johnydarko\"> /u/johnydarko </a> <br/> <span><",

We have to keep it pg-13 and below. Thanks! Edit for movies I forgot she watched at a different time:</p> <p>Forgot they have seen most Disney movies prior- not Fox and the hound so will tell them that. </p> <p>Have also watched My girl with no tears </p> <p>Second update: they have decided on Old Yeller.
