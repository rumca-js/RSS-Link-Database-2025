        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been hoarding a lid (with the front plastics) for an Amiga 3000 for a good 15 years. Unfortunately I made the huge mistake of never removing the battery, which completely destroyed the motherboard, ruined the chassis. I don&#39;t know where the rest of the components go, but I still have the lid and front (with the blank for the one floppy drive and also the power button assembly rod).</p> <p>I&#39;d like to eBay it, in the UK, and was wondering what a reasonable asking price would be. Working A3000&#39;s tend to go for \u00a32000 now, so I am hoping as the lid I have is in superb condition (for something about 30 years ago) that it could fetch a reasonable amount. The only real mark is where a sticker has been. I do have sticker remover, but didn&#39;t want to cause any damage trying it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Efficient-Junket6969\"> /u/Efficient-Junket6969 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",
