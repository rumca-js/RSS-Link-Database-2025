According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-XZ6ypvnFk">this video</a>, which has even lower specs than me (Ryzen 5 instead of 7), you should be able to &#39;emulate&#39; ray tracing on Linux on the lowest game settings with RADV.</p> <p>Has anybody tried this, and if so; could you explain your setup please?

I&#39;ve currently got a few games installed - witcher 3, valheim and death stranding all have this issue, but shadow of the tombraider seems to work without issues.

I have several assumptions about how this works, especially as a gamer who uses both a high-end PC and a Steam Deck. However, I need clarity, accurate information, and reliable sources to back up my findings. I would really appreciate your insights and expertise on the following:</p> <h1>Steam&#39;s Shader Pre-Caching System:</h1> <ul> <li>How exactly does Steam generate precompiled shader caches for Vulkan/DXVK games?</li> <li>Are these caches generated by users during gameplay and shared with others, or does Steam have an internal process (like bots or dedicated testing setups)?</li> </ul> <h1>Shader Compatibility Across Systems:</h1> <ul> <li>Why is shader cache compatibility (the sharing process) more viable in Vulkan/DXVK compared to

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had to reinstall my handheld for a few different reasons….and ended up with Chimera OS. It works great for most games, except Helldivers 2 won’t let me join any matches, and quickplay doesn’t work.</p> <p>Only thing I’ve read is that anti-cheat may not be working…but I can find any solution to this…</p> <p>I tried Proton Exprimental already, and I removed the anti-cheat folder so it would re-install.
