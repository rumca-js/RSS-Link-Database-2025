I&#39;ve looked, but it seems most consider that too boring and always include a story that overshadows the school life.</p> <p>Super Powereds is the closest I&#39;ve found (and loved), while it had an overarching plot that needed a conclusion, it wasn&#39;t focused on that, it had long sections of the students learning, having parties, building relationships. I&#39;d like to find one focused on magic next, but super powers are fine, or related suggestions.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I’m looking for a horror book that explores the primal fear people have of the deep dark forest, getting lost, seeing the forest stretch on forever, fear of being lost and feeling that the forest is alive or trying to eat them alive, not in the sense of animals trying to hunt you down but basically the forest itself trying to wipe you out of existence, so to speak. Could be fiction or non-fiction, based on folklore or whatnot, could be about a serial killer on the loose, could just be someone who is lost and feels that there is “something” (maybe the true nature or appearance of this thing isn’t revealed, kind of like in bird box or lovecraft’s stuff) that the main character feels is around them. Could be that this thing is chasing them down or breaking their will down/messing with them or just waiting like carrion-eater birds (crows/ravens) to pounce once the character dies/gives up/loses. Thanks for any suggestions about or related to those top

I adore the show Baby on Netflix, it’s an Italian show where 2 girls are in a rich private school and delve into a dark side of prostitution, nightlife, etc. there’s plenty of drama and romance between the characters.

First time I was blown away by the personal stuff they put in the story for my 5yo son. I actually asked them for a bunch of changes and they never charged extra. Anyway I dont think Im gonna grab another one so soon so thought Id share it here. Code is 4EEB3ONX and it says it lasts 24 hours. Not sure if you can use it more than once but hey if you do use it lmk if it worked. If this is the wrong spot to share just holler. I was super surprised at how much time they spent going over each detail with me (like I was worried theyd get my sons hairstyle all weird). If anyone tries them or if yall think this is some scam or something let me know. I could be missing something.</p> <p>Hope it helps someone. Feel free to correct me if Im messing up or if I posted in a weird place. Good luck if you grab it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="ht

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello :) I’m looking for book recommendations where the two leads are BOTH assassins. The vibe I’m going for is the following: -One is tasked with killing the other (or both tasked with killing each other) -Enemies turned to lovers, preferably slow burn -The female’s perspective preferably -Strong characters that aren’t dense -Spicy scenes -Can really be any romance, but I do love fantasy, sci-fi, smutty, and historical fiction the most</p> <p>I’ve seen a lot of books where it’s an immediate connection, or the guy is trying to kill the weak girl, but I want both characters to be badass and to have some build up to it if that makes sense. Let me know if you guys know of anything! :)</p> <p>I could also go for one where the male is an assassin tasked with killing the female lead if nothing really fits the above request, but I’d like the female to be strong, slow burn, spicy, etc. lol.</p> <p>I’m also curious to know how many of you would be interested

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! </p> <p>I&#39;ve been obsessed with finding a big collection of greek myths, like this one book I had when I was little. I guess an example of what I&#39;m looking for would be Robert Graves&#39; &quot;The Greek Myths: The Complete and Definitive Edition&quot;. </p> <p>I would have already bought one of those books, but the majority of them seem to be written/translated by men. I&#39;ve been super into Greek mythology ever since I was little but as I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve begun to feel disillusioned by the way most female characters are portrayed. Obviously, I get that the myths are a product of their time and the men of ancient Greece baked misogyny into pretty much every facet of the stories, but I think that having modern men translate those stories only exacerbates the issue. </p> <p>I&#39;ve read Emily Wilson&#39;s translations of the Illiad and the Odyssey, and I much prefer her depiction of characters like Helen, Calypso,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently, I read Zero to One by Peter Thiel, and I wanted to share three key takeaways that really stood out to me:</p> <ol> <li><p>Creating a Monopoly vs. Competing: Thiel emphasizes that building a monopoly, where you create something truly unique, is far more valuable than competing in saturated markets. This idea shifted how I think about business opportunities.</p></li> <li><p>The Power of &#39;Zero to One&#39; Thinking: Rather than incremental improvements, focusing on breakthroughs—creating something that doesn’t exist yet—can lead to truly transformative ventures.</p></li> <li><p>Thinking Long-Term: Thiel highlights the importance of long-term thinking and planning for a business, as short-term gains often lead to failure in the long run.</p></li> </ol> <p>What were your key takeaways from the book? Do any of these resonate with your experiences or perspectives?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says, I loved this book. I definitely want to read others by this author and fully intend to. The reason I chose to read the spin off novel before the main series was simply because I was desperately trying to find a romance where the male love interest was actually nice and sweet… the whole time! Someone recommended this book to me and it was honestly exactly what I was looking for. Apparently I love golden retriever cinnamon rolls and I won’t apologize for it. </p> <p>I loved the fantasy setting and how cozy it was. Though cozy isn’t mandatory in what you may suggest. I guess I just want something that’s got a romance that is this level of sweet and wholesome. I want my heart to melt! I am also not against 🌶️ as long as it’s not the entire point (if that makes sense) and the plot and everything else just an afterthought. Not that anything is wrong with pure smut but it’s not what I am in the mood for.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </di

Pretty much a reversal of the billionaire playboy trope or something similar. It’s fine if they both have some experience but I don’t want the playboy x virgin story. I also don’t want a lot of cheating either.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had posted the question below in <a href="/r/books">r/books</a> but it got removed, hence asking here in case anyone has any suggestions! </p> <p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m a newbie and I am having trouble finding a position to read books from which I don&#39;t get lasting pain in my neck. I have tried reading on the sofa, bed, recliner, everytime I notice my neck looking down in the book. After I am done reading I realize that my neck hurts. Just like working on the computer, I find to best when I am looking straight at the monitor (ergonomic way), I can&#39;t seem to read physical books in that way. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love reading so much but like every recommendation I see on booktok is fantasy and i have come to realize tha I like books better when I can relate to it. Dystopian is fine, im not sure why, I just really dont like fantasy or freaky romance . I would say that my favorite genre is YA but mainly like soul crushing.

I read a good chunk of ,,Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda” and I really liked it (firstly I wanted to order that one) but then I found some other collections so now I’m torn between that one, ,,The Letters of FSF” (Andrew Turnbull) and recently I heard good things about ,,The Correspondence of FSF”.
