Sure if there’s too much of it then it can give me a headache, but when games allow you to customize it, then I’m never complaining about it. For me no motion blur can make a game look choppy and just removes fun from it.</p> <p>To be honest, I don’t know why people hate on it so much, since it’s something you can manage and you don’t absolutely need it to play most of the time. </p> <p>I dont know, I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest, since I get judged irl for using it and unironically liking it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Th3Unkn0wnPl4y3r"> /u/Th3Unkn0wnPl4y3r </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1i5n9fv/unpopula
