        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! I&#39;m hoping to find some books focused on the magic boarding school. Like Harry Potter without Voldemort. No overarching &quot;save the world&quot; stuff, they&#39;re just learning about magic, having small dramas and fun. I&#39;ve looked, but it seems most consider that too boring and always include a story that overshadows the school life.</p> <p>Super Powereds is the closest I&#39;ve found (and loved), while it had an overarching plot that needed a conclusion, it wasn&#39;t focused on that, it had long sections of the students learning, having parties, building relationships. I&#39;d like to find one focused on magic next, but super powers are fine, or related suggestions. The Name of the Wind was also pretty good.</p> <p>Would prefer to avoid Xianxia/cultivation, poorly translated works, and anything with lots of suffering/anxiety/injustice.</p> <p>Read: The Name of the Wind (8/10), Percy Jackson (5/10), Red Rising (8/10).

Looking for any series recommendations really! Recently I\u2019ve read the First Law trilogy (currently reading the age of madness), The red rising saga, the will of the many, the mistborn first trilogy and probably going to move on to the stargazers war or storm light archives next! Just love to find new authors, genres and styles of writing so if it\u2019s along what I have already read or something you might think could branch me out a little I would love to know.

Could be fiction or non-fiction, based on folklore or whatnot, could be about a serial killer on the loose, could just be someone who is lost and feels that there is \u201csomething\u201d (maybe the true nature or appearance of this thing isn\u2019t revealed, kind of like in bird box or lovecraft\u2019s stuff) that the main character feels is around them. Could be that this thing is chasing them down or breaking their will down/messing with them or just waiting like carrion-eater birds (crows/ravens) to pounce once the character dies/gives up/loses.

First time I was blown away by the personal stuff they put in the story for my 5yo son. I actually asked them for a bunch of changes and they never charged extra. Anyway I dont think Im gonna grab another one so soon so thought Id share it here. Code is 4EEB3ONX and it says it lasts 24 hours. Not sure if you can use it more than once but hey if you do use it lmk if it worked. If this is the wrong spot to share just holler. I was super surprised at how much time they spent going over each detail with me (like I was worried theyd get my sons hairstyle all weird). If anyone tries them or if yall think this is some scam or something let me know. I could be missing something.</p> <p>Hope it helps someone. Feel free to correct me if Im messing up or if I posted in a weird place. Good luck if you grab it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

The vibe I\u2019m going for is the following: -One is tasked with killing the other (or both tasked with killing each other) -Enemies turned to lovers, preferably slow burn -The female\u2019s perspective preferably -Strong characters that aren\u2019t dense -Spicy scenes -Can really be any romance, but I do love fantasy, sci-fi, smutty, and historical fiction the most</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of books where it\u2019s an immediate connection, or the guy is trying to kill the weak girl, but I want both characters to be badass and to have some build up to it if that makes sense. Let me know if you guys know of anything! :)</p> <p>I could also go for one where the male is an assassin tasked with killing the female lead if nothing really fits the above request, but I\u2019d like the female to be strong, slow burn, spicy, etc. lol.</p> <p>I\u2019m also curious to know how many of you would be interested ",

I read a good chunk of ,,Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda\u201d and I really liked it (firstly I wanted to order that one) but then I found some other collections so now I\u2019m torn between that one, ,,The Letters of FSF\u201d (Andrew Turnbull) and recently I heard good things about ,,The Correspondence of FSF\u201d. So yeah, if anyone has some advice (or other better recommendations, I\u2019m all for it!), the help would be very appreciated :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prettyoddright\"> /u/prettyoddright </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i5f26b/which_collection_of_f_scott_fitzgeralds_letters/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i5f26b/which_collection_of_f_scott_fitzgeralds_letters/\">[comments]</a></span>",
