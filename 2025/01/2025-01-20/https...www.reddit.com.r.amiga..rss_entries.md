<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is anyone interested in an A1000 external floppy drive? I got one off eBay but when I hook it up to my A600 it just eats up the disk. Happy to trade for another external drive that works with an A600 if that&#39;s easier. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Floor_1799"> /u/One_Floor_1799 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i5zdnf/a1000_external_disk_drive/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i5zdnf/a1000_external_disk_drive/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found a couple boxes of my old Amiga disks. The boxes were proper disk cases (with a key lock lol) but other than that, they were just sitting on a shelf in our basement. How likely are they to be ok? I don&#39;t have my old Amiga anymore but I&#39;m considering buying one just to see what is on these...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LingonberryNarrow755"> /u/LingonberryNarrow755 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i5ymq6/found_amiga_disk_drives/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i5ymq6/found_amiga_disk_drives/">[comments]</a></span>

## Amiga 3000 Top Lid Worth

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been hoarding a lid (with the front plastics) for an Amiga 3000 for a good 15 years. Unfortunately I made the huge mistake of never removing the battery, which completely destroyed the motherboard, ruined the chassis. I don&#39;t know where the rest of the components go, but I still have the lid and front (with the blank for the one floppy drive and also the power button assembly rod).</p> <p>I&#39;d like to eBay it, in the UK, and was wondering what a reasonable asking price would be. Working A3000&#39;s tend to go for Â£2000 now, so I am hoping as the lid I have is in superb condition (for something about 30 years ago) that it could fetch a reasonable amount. The only real mark is where a sticker has been. I do have sticker remover, but didn&#39;t want to cause any damage trying it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Efficient-Junket6969"> /u/Efficient-Junket6969 </a> <br/> <span><a href="h
