On top of the freecam I\u2019d also like to turn off that horrible motion blur that occurs every time a stealth kill\u2019s performed. Last but not least I\u2019d also like to be able to spawn more enemies on a stage. For this I offer an even 100 euros/dollars. For common sense and mutual protection, I\u2019d like to propose this: If you accept all I request from you BEFORE payment is a proof of concept ie. a short video for example that you send me proving the table works. Not the cheat table itself. Only AFTER I paid you do I request it. DM me if interested!</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SorbetAsleep\"> /u/SorbetAsleep </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i61ves/tenchu_z_freecam_commission/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameM",
