<p>Tim Cook on X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. King once said, “Everybody can be great, because everybody can
serve.” True greatness lies in lifting others, making a
difference, and serving with purpose. Let’s honor his legacy by
finding ways to serve and create a better world together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curious to see if that’s Cook’s only tweet of the day, or if a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/i_wonder">congratulatory one</a> is forthcoming, after Trump’s oath of office at noon.</p>

<p>Apple has been dedicating its homepage to MLK on his holiday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/search/?s=martin+luther+king+jr">for at least 10 years</a>, so <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/apple-homepage-mlk">today</a> isn’t some exception just because it’s also Inauguration Day.

<p>“The great majority of Americans are suspended between these opposing attitudes. They are uneasy with injustice but unwilling yet to pay a significant price to eradicate it.”</p>
