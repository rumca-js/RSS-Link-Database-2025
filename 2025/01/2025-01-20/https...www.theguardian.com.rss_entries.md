<p>There were times when Enzo Maresca seemed to have the weight of the world on his shoulders. The Italian mooched around his technical area, bemoaning Chelsea’s frantic play and calling for calm. Panic had set in after another lead was frittered away, shoddy handling from the erratic Robert Sánchez gifting a mediocre Wolves an equaliser at the end of an average first half, and the winless run was in danger of ticking up to six.</p><p>However, while Sánchez remains an accident waiting to happen in goal, at least Chelsea had a second half to correct matters against one of the leakiest defences in the Premier League. The nerves faded after Marc Cucurella restored the advantage after an hour. Authority returned and although this was far from Chelsea’s most stylish win of the season, a final score of 3-1 was enough to capitalise on Newcastle’s setback against Bournemouth and see Maresca’s side take fourth place off Manchester City before they visit the champions on Saturday.</p> <a href=

<p>Indelible stories from survivors and chilling present-day footage of the former camp combine to make this short, stark yet hopeful film. Look at the world in 2025 and you can easily see why it is such vital viewing</p><p>This month is the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, and, in Jordan Dunbar’s documentary What Happened at Auschwitz, there is a sense of these chances to remember running out. Most obviously that’s true in terms of being able to speak directly to the survivors: Dunbar meets a handful of them, and their clarity and focus are undimmed, yet their numbers are declining.</p><p>Dunbar, however, assigns his subject matter another, different urgency. We live, he observes, in an era of disinformation and rising hatred. A terrifying percentage of online content and commentary about the Holocaust questions whether it happened or celebrates that it did. Less than a century since this appalling crime against humani

<p>Ruben Amorim thinks so, but other managers have faced similar struggles. Here is a trip down memory lane to some of the worst crises at Old Trafford …</p><p>If United’s current state feels like a lost decade, then the 1930s were its progenitor, much of it spent in the second tier, fans yearning for the early 1900s glory years under Ernest Mangnall, one of only three United managers – with Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson – to win the league title. United finished last in the First Division at the end of the 1930-31 season, winning seven games, losing their opening 12, conceding 115 goals, the manager Herbert Bamlett, better known as a referee, sacked with six fixtures to play. The previous owner, John Henry Davies, who had funded the Mangnall years, had died in 1927, stretching finances. According to the author Eamon Dunphy, the final game, with Middlesbrough, drew 3,900 to Old Trafford, an “uncanny atmosphere” with “the shouts of derision echoing through the empty grandstand”.

She was also president of a women’s refuge, and signed 1971’s influential Manifesto of the 343 Women, in which the signatories all admitted to having had an illegal abortion.

<p>Stars such as Alyssa Healy and Ash Gardner not missed as home side close in on cleansweep against overhyped rivals</p><p>“England’s best format is T20.” It’s been a mantra through this Women’s Ashes series so far. With Australia the stronger team, and the series starting with the 50-over format in which they dominate, it was repeated by England followers, repeated by media wanting a close series for the story, even flashed up in the television blurb describing the first 20-over match from the SCG. As those one-day internationals were lost <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/17/england-seek-inspiration-from-2023-womens-ashes-after-australia-odi-sweep-cricket">one after the other</a>, the insistence has developed a ring of desperation, like “I can quit any time or want” or “I’m fine to drive”.</p><p>The problem is, if England’s best style is the short one, they still have to play it against the country who have won six T20 World Cups. In Sydney, England didn’t field

<p>Supporting a spouse courtside is deemed more stressful than playing with mixed emotions for tennis couple</p><p>In the aftermath of a strong comeback win that moved her into a grand slam quarter-final for the 12th time in her career, Elina Svitolina departed Rod Laver Arena fully aware that her most difficult task of the day was still to come. She warmed down, showered, completed her media obligations and ate her post-match meal, then returned to the courts as a spectator, sitting in the front row of the courtside coaching boxes on Margaret Court to cheer on her husband, Gaël Monfils, in his own fourth round match against Ben Shelton.</p><p>“It’s more stressful,” said Monfils of the experience of supporting a spouse courtside, after a back injury ended his match in the fourth set. “It’s more stressful because you’re not in control, you want to help, and you can just help with talking, but it’s different because when you play yourself. You really want to help sometimes, with strate

<p>Musk desperately wants to appropriate gamer credibility, but he may be faking it – and doing exactly what toxic nerds have been accusing women of doing for decades</p><p>Last year on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Elon Musk claimed to be one of the world’s best Diablo IV players – and surprisingly, the leaderboards backed him up. For those that haven’t had the pleasure, Diablo is one of the most mercilessly time-intensive video games out there; you build a character and carve through armies of demons, spending hundreds of hours refining skills and equipment for maximum hellspawn-cleansing efficiency. I played it for maybe five hours last year and immediately quit, for fear that it would consume my life. Most of the people who play it are young, often male, and have plenty of time to themselves to spend on the internet and playing games – so, the exact demographic of many Musk stans.</p><p>It suited these hardcore gamer guys to believe that someone who tweets all day and runs several busines

<p>Seemingly inspired by the Rotherham child rape scandal, Nathan Shepka’s film has both a streak of sentimentality and an appetite for violence</p><p>Here is a vigilante thriller co-directed, written by and starring prolific low-budget Scottish film-maker Nathan Shepka, which has a kind of grim integrity despite the uneven acting and numerous rough edges. Seemingly inspired by the Rotherham grooming gang scandal, but transposing the story to Glasgow, Shepka plays laconic nightclub bouncer Alex, who is asked to do a Jack Carter and rescue a teenage girl from sex-trafficking hell.</p><p>Not that this takes place in a world where anyone does anything out of innate goodness. The job, and the accompanying 20 grand, are sent his way by a retired lawyer (ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy) who is trying to cover up the fact that the girl’s mother is a heroin addict sleeping with a major politician. But Alex isn’t fundamentally a wrong’un; he visits his deaf father languishing in a care home, an

<p>Midfielder starred for leaders but his future lies away from club that plays in different style to when he was in his pomp</p><p>There were times in the past when it seemed like he would do this forever; there were other times when it felt like he would never do it again. Leon Goretzka breaking a game open for Bayern Munich in his own special way doesn’t feel like it should be headline news but it is, and it was a timely intervention for the Bundesliga leaders on a rare quiet day for Harry Kane.</p><p>On a day when Wolfsburg were what they rarely are on visits to the Allianz Arena – a genuine irritant – and when Kane wasn’t able to bail Bayern out, they needed some practical rigour to see them over the line, and Goretzka provided it. Not predictably so, however. Having once been one of the avowed cornerstones of present and future Bayern, Goretzka is in the unusual position of having to prove himself all over again, though not necessarily to his current employers.</p> <a href="htt

<p>Smell has an outsize effect on our thoughts and moods, so it’s worth paying more attention to it</p><p>If you have been on holiday recently, do you think you could recall and describe what the place smelled like? You probably don’t get asked that question very often. And yet, the characteristic smell of a place seems to contain its special essence. Photos can’t truly bring back the feeling of being there, but smell has that power.</p><p>Our sense of smell develops before we’re born, and it is strongly linked to brain centres associated with creating new memories and perceiving emotions and&nbsp;bodily sensations. As a result, smells can merge these together, forming vividly personal memories. Most of us have smells that act as a trigger, transporting us to another time and place; for some it is the ocean breeze in summer, for others it might be urban smells of coffee houses, exhaust fumes or a hot pavement on a sunny day.

<p>Temperatures will drop by 15-20C with heavy rain and snow predicted in some states</p><p>Much of the US is bracing for a severe cold spell this week with temperatures set to plummet. In some places maximum temperatures are expected to drop by 15-20C over just a couple of days in contrast to above average temperatures in parts of the US earlier last week.</p><p>The rapid change in conditions is due to winds in the upper atmosphere weakening and meandering. At about six miles above the Earth’s surface there is a strong circulation known as the polar vortex around the north pole, which usually helps to keep cold air trapped there. However, late last week and early this week the circulation has been weakening and meandering, allowing a cold plume of air to be brought in from the north. Temperatures across central and eastern parts of the US are forecast to be 10-15C below average, with New York likely to see temperatures struggling to get out of negative double digits during daytime.

<p>Court in Murcia region says woman should get 32 weeks of leave – the amount given to a couple – rather than 16 weeks</p><p>A court in Spain has ruled that a single mother is entitled to the parental leave that would have been due her partner – if she had one – on the grounds that all babies should be treated the same, regardless of the composition of their families.</p><p>The woman, a part-time worker known by the initials SPM, gave birth to a daughter in the south-eastern region of Murcia in January 2022. SPM requested additional parental leave, arguing that her daughter was entitled to the same amount of parental care as any other newborn. After her request was turned down by social services and the courts, she appealed to the regional high court.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/single-mother-entitled-to-same-parental-leave-as-couple-spanish-court-rules">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When a demobbed British marine goes after his daughter’s killers, his old comrades pile in to beef up the relentless gunfights</p><p>This is a boorish, blokey film, the cinematic equivalent of a man sitting on the tube with his legs spread wide apart. It’s a violent British revenge thriller starring ex-Marine (and Jeff Bridges lookalike) Tip Cullen as a veteran getting payback for the death of his teenage daughter from drugs. Everyone involved has clearly worked extremely hard with what looks like a very low budget, but the cracks do show; it’s impossible to take a gangland crime boss seriously when he’s wearing such a nasty cheap suit. To be fair, most of the funding looks like it’s been chucked at SUVs and imitation assault rifles for the relentless gunfights.</p><p>As it happens, veteran marine Andy (Cullen) carries out his first kills using bits and bobs borrowed from work; he’s the manager of a hardware shop so he picks off the bad guys in a seedy drug den with a staple gun a

Slower than the tram, the bus isn’t a bad ride, curving up the ring road lined with 20th-century apartment blocks in edible colours: lemon, toffee, olive, custard, salmon, milk chocolate, cream, Smurf ice-cream blue … Conveniently, the bus stops right next to the market, which is known by the name of the square it fills: San Giovanni di Dio. There are big plans to redesign it completely, but for now this busy market remains a Tetris-like arrangement of iron boxes – a scheme rolled out in the late 1950s as part of Rome’s preparation for the 1960 Olympics, in which previously open markets were tidied up and vendors allocated boxes with rolling shutters that provided both storage and a stall.</p><p>There mus

<p>Photographer and art director who oversaw a series of controversial ad campaigns for the Benetton fashion brand</p><p>The art direction and photographs of Oliviero Toscani were provocative not for what they showed – real life, he said, complex and contradictory – but where they were seen. The images, subjects ranging from a bloodied newborn baby to the condemned of death row, would have been unremarkable on the editorial pages of a classic photo-reportage publication such as Life or Paris Match. But they sprang out of the safe spaces reserved for prestige adverts at the front of fashion magazines, or were pasted up on big billboards.</p><p>Toscani, who has died aged 82, regarded advertising as the most powerful medium, and claimed an artist’s right, like Michelangelo, to express his ideas in it. Like Michelangelo, he had a patron of papal benevolence, Luciano Benetton, who paid for the spaces where Toscani’s creations were seen. Benetton had co-founded a family firm that evolved i

He called it Nintendo – a phrase whose meaning is lost to time according to Nintendo’s own historians, but which can be translated as “leave luck up to heaven”. In the 1970s, Nintendo eventually transitioned from paper games to electronic ones, making its own luck in the process. It has been a permanent fixture in living rooms across the world ever since.</p><p>For budding artist Takaya Imamura, an art student who had been captivated by Metroid and Super Mario Bros 3 in the 1980s, working at Nintendo was a dream. “Back in 1985 when Super Mario came out in Japan, everybody was playing it,” he recalls. “I was at an art university, studying design at the time.

<p>The next entry in our series of writers recommending their favourite comfort films is a tribute to Jonathan Demme’s zesty gangster comedy</p><p>There’s no more perfect song to open a movie than Rosemary Clooney’s Mambo Italiano in Jonathan Demme’s Married to the Mob. It’s a delightful nonsense song that mimics Cuban mambo music while spilling out lyrics that are about as authentically Italian as a suburban Olive Garden. It’s Demme’s way of announcing that his gangster comedy will be a zesty, multicultural puttanesca that may evoke The Godfather and other genre standards, but mostly indulges in the cartoon kitsch of Long Island goombahs. The film that follows isn’t quite a parody, a spoof or a satire. It’s merely an unmitigated joy from start to finish.</p><p>There are so many fun touches around the edges of Married to the Mob – the colorful production design, the expertly curated new wave soundtrack, the endless gallery of big and supporting players – but as Angela de Marco, a hou

Brighton’s first two goals came from players being given space on the flanks in the huge gaps between wing-backs and centre-backs. Kaoru Mitoma gifted Yankuba Minteh a tap in and the favour was repaid in the second half. Leny Yoro had terrible troubles against Southampton and there were similar struggles once again as Brighton tested him on the outside. Noussair Mazraoui had a forgettable afternoon, looking poor in possession, which helped Brighton for the opener and he failed to intervene before Mitoma steered the second home at the back post. Mazraoui was moved to the left and soon the third goal arrived as Yasin Ayari was given the freedom to cross the ball.

<p>Manchester City striker’s wages may appear outrageous but they are in line with the level of pay given to other superstars</p><p>What do you make of Erling Haaland’s new £500,000-a-week basic salary? Ridiculous? Staggering? Obscene at a time when too many children are arriving at school unfed? That&nbsp;seemed to be the prevailing view after his 10-year contract with Manchester City was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/17/erling-haaland-signs-new-manchester-city-contract-to-2034">announced on Friday</a>. Even Haaland admitted his contract was “a bit crazy”.</p><p>But do you know what may be crazier still? Haaland making £26m a year actually makes sense. For football reasons, yes. Because of what economists call the “superstar” effect – which explains why the gap between the sporting super elite and the next best is widening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/20/erling-haaland-salary-manchester-city-makes-sense">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Heavy defeats during the pool stage suggest Premiership teams lack the power of the best French and Irish sides</p><p>Five English clubs have made it beyond base camp in the Champions Cup this season, but scaling the distant summit already feels like an impossible dream. While Northampton, Saracens, Leicester, Sale and Harlequins<strong> </strong>have all secured qualification for the last 16, they will need something truly special if they are to make any kind of impact at the sharp end of the competition.</p><p>The sight of Leicester, one of the Premiership’s handful of pool survivors, enduring a record annihilation in Toulouse was just another stark reminder that the bigger French and Irish sides continue to be the tournament’s dominant forces. The last English club to win the title was Exeter in 2020 and there are few obvious signs of the gap closing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/20/english-quintet-face-uphill-task-at-business-end-of-champions-cup">Co

## Is it true that … stress makes you gain weight?

<p>Food quells anxieties, but is a short-term fix that leads to excess weight. Finding other ways to relieve stress is preferable</p><p>This wellbeing myth is almost true, says Dr Caroline Apovian, director of the Nutrition and Weight Management Center at Boston University Medical Centre. “Stress can lead to weight gain,” she says, “but it’s not that stress itself, by any metabolic reason, causes weight gain.” Rather, the correlation is&nbsp;that people often turn to overeating as a reaction to stress.</p><p>When our body feels it’s in danger, hormones are secreted, one of which is cortisol. Cortisol increases our heart rate, making us feel hyped up and anxious, motivating us to engage in reward-driven behaviour. It’s what would once have given the boost needed to run away from a woolly mammoth attack, but it’s less useful at&nbsp;helping us deal with modern, nonphysical stressors, such as looming deadlines. That’s where food comes in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeand

<p>Beecher’s beautiful memoir, written partly in response to the death of her brother aged 25, describes in startling detail the highs and lows of existence</p><p>The title of Anna Beecher’s first work of nonfiction can be read in various ways – an expression of triumph, relief or anticlimax. She uses it as a punchline to the book’s opening chapter, which recounts a car accident she experienced as a graduate student in the US. Here she conjures in vivid detail the violent shock of impact, the moments of silent disbelief in the immediate aftermath as she waits for understanding to catch up with physical sensation, dreading the discovery of what happened to the occupants of the other car, now spinning on its roof.</p><p>In the event, no one is hurt, but Beecher pictures all too readily a parallel reality in which the crash resulted in several deaths, and she and her friend return home carrying the weight of that knowledge. “Our lives are punctured by moments of impossibility when the f

<p>Tina Shingler was fostered in a white family in North Yorkshire in the 1960s, where her hair was a source of anxiety and stress. Then she wrote a ‘hairmoir’ and now she empowers others to embrace their hair too</p><p>Growing up, Tina Shingler didn’t touch her hair like other girls touched theirs. She didn’t preen, stroke or comb – though sometimes she hid pens and cigarettes in it. “I had no respect for it, because no one else had any,” she says.</p><p>As a “Barnardo’s child”, Shingler’s hair presented a challenge to her white foster parents, Mary, a housewife, and Jack, a semi-skilled mechanic. She had a happy enough childhood, but every few months was required to kneel in the sitting room in Ripon, North Yorkshire, and rest her head in Mary’s lap to be “shorn”. The language was always animalistic, Shingler says. It was “to bow your head”, and know your hair was “something to be got rid of”.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/04/tell-us-has-your-life
