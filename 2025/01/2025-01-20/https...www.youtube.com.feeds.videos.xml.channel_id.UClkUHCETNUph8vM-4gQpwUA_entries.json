        "description": "AI Limit Gameplay Impressions - Demo Review & Thoughts\nI recently came across the demo for AI Limit and realized I hadn\u2019t actually given it a try yet. It\u2019s been popping up around a lot lately, especially with comparisons to Code Vein. I\u2019ve seen people even calling it Code Vein 2. Naturally, I was curious and decided to jump in. Now, if you\u2019re into Soulslike games, you\u2019ll definitely notice a lot of familiar mechanics here, like the methodical combat, the painful enemies who could take chunks off your health with just a swipe, and that constant tension of risk and reward. But what makes AI Limit stand apart is how it tries to soften the blow a bit. It\u2019s not as punishing as the more traditional Soulslike titles, making it a little more approachable for players who might shy away from the brutal difficulty or the steep learning curve. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve taken the good parts of that genre and made it more accessible without totally watering it down.\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 - AI Limit Demo Gamepla",
