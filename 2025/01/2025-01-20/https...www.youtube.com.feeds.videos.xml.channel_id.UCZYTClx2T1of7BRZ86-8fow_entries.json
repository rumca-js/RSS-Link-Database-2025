But researchers have been struggling to find ways to actually get this to work. Which is why they've had to get creative, and one solution they've come up with is... killing trees. It's so crazy, it just might work, and here's how. \n\nSciShow posts a new video 5 times a week, and our science-backed videos were viewed 140 million times last year. But SciShow has always needed your help to keep going, and that\u2019s true now more than ever! We\u2019re selling limited-edition postcards to help us fund another year of SciShow. Check them out - get access to a secret video, and know that you\u2019ve made a difference.\n\n\nHosted by: Hank Green (he/him)\n\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us d",
