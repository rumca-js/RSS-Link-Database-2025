<p>Praise rarely comes striker’s way but after match-winning hat-trick at Betis, cult hero was showered with it</p><p>This could have only felt more right if you read about it on Teletext. On Saturday afternoon Kike García, the 6ft 1in, 12 stone, 35-year-old Deportivo Alavés centre-forward with a bit of the 80s about him, a player from the recent past who doesn’t always get a lot of goals but always gives every little thing he has got, scored the perfect hat-trick to defeat Real Betis 3-1. Right foot, left foot, header and the lovable lump from La Mancha who everyone assumes is Basque, all mud and guts, the man whose coach once called him a “hard-working oaf”, left the Benito Villamarín with the match ball under his arm, something for the cabinet at home. But that, he said, was not the best thing about it, not now, and he meant it too, which is the best thing about him.</p><p>“I’m not Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi; they’ll have 900 of these,” García said, exaggerating just a ween

Throughout the 2024 season, Sinner not only held his opponents in a chokehold on the biggest stages, he had often done so with his typical calm, neutral expression barely changing. As Sinner methodically compiled significant titles throughout the 2024 season, he made his immense efforts appear to be routine.</p><p>Three sets into his highly anticipated intragenerational tussle with Holger Rune, though, Sinner was clearly uncomfortable. He limped gingerly between points, his hands shook as he sat down at the change of ends and, most importantly, his unforced errors piled up. Down two break points at 1-1 in set three, Sinner was in trouble.</p

Lord Farquaad, the punctilious local potentate, is rounding up various misfits and banishing them to Shrek’s swamp.
