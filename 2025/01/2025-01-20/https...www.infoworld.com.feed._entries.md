<p>More than half of enterprises (56%) run mission-critical workloads in hybrid environments, according to a 2024 EDB survey of enterprise executives. From <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3629889/what-is-a-data-warehouse-the-source-of-business-intelligence.html">data warehouses</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3658333/what-is-a-data-lake-massively-scalable-storage-for-big-data-analytics.html">data lakes</a> to HTAP, OLTP, and AI development, hybrid models have become a strategic advantage, offering security and scalability while giving enterprises greater control over their most critical and differentiating asset—their data.</p>

<p>Nearly 10% of all software engineers are “ghosts” who “do virtually nothing” but collect $300K salaries. This, according to <a href="https://x.com/yegordb/status/1859291022863499700">research from Stanford University</a>. The paper takes particular aim at engineers who work remotely, <a href="https://x.com/yegordb/status/1859291153469931653">declaring that 14% of them</a> apparently spend more time gardening than tending to their <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3654955/what-is-git-version-control-for-collaborative-programming.html">Git </a>repositories. Controversial? Yes. Accurate? Almost certainly not—at least, not based on this particular analysis of more than 50,000 engineers. Th

<p>I was promoted to CTO in my late twenties, and while it is common to see young CTOs leading startups these days, it was unusual in the ’90s. I was far less experienced back then, and still developing my <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712246/5-ways-tech-leaders-can-increase-their-business-acumen.html">business acumen</a>. While I was a strong software developer, it wasn’t my architecture and coding skills that helped me transition to a C-level role.</p>



<p>Of all the technical skills I had back then, my devops skills were the most critical. Of course, we didn’t call it <em>devops</em>, as the term hadn’t been invented yet. We didn’t yet have <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/art
