## A different approach to ranking games

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Community,</p> <p>Giving games an arbitrary static score (e.g. 9/10, 90% etc) has never seemed to me as being a good way to rank or review games. Numbers mean different things to different people, who play games for different reasons. Comparing games of different genres with a single score is not a great way to determine which is best. And games on release are often different a few months later after patches and DLC content, making original ranking obsolete. What if instead, game &quot;ranking&quot; was determined by comparing similar games, and games were then ranked algorithmically for each specific genre?</p> <p>So, I wrote this website called <a href="https://steamgames.whichisthe.best/">https://steamgames.whichisthe.best.</a> You log in with Steam and rate games against each other (two at a time) within your library for each genre (or Steam User Tag) associated with that game. As you go it will create your tier list, and update a global tier
