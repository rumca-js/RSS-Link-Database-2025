<p>It’s all thriller, no filler this week in television — well, that plus a comedy-drama about girls trying to find fulfilling love and sex during their sophomore year of college. But the main events this week are pretty much all some type of espionage thriller. Pretty much all of these spies are stressed (predictable) and in situations (unpredictable) that bring on plenty of twists, turns, and calculus (sometimes literally). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there’s more new TV to watch, too: Lest we forget, shows like <em>Abbott Elementary</em> and <em>Sever

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s 2025, and no, we still haven’t heard word about a <em>Red God</em> release date. In the meantime, though, I’ve been holding myself over lately with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stonemaier-Games-Management-Combo-Building-Players/dp/B08XZNGH9Y"><em>Red Rising</em></a> board game. Turns out, a conveniently color-coded social hierarchy lends itself not just to timely social commentary, but also to the bones of a terrific board game.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole crux of Red Rising, an excellent series of grimdark sci-fi novels written by Pierce Brown, is a futuristic version of humanity that has remade itself — quite literally, via genetic modification — into c

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Brandon Sanderson is one of fantasy’s most successful authors of all time, a prolific mega-bestseller who’s built a fandom so voracious and dedicated that they paid a record-setting <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/surprise-four-secret-novels-by-brandon-sanderson">$41 million on Kickstarter</a> to launch four books he wrote in secret while still maintaining his other series.

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are too many games released each week to keep up with what’s worth adding to your backlog. That isn’t hyperbole — there really are hundreds of games released on Steam alone every week, not to mention titles new to consoles and other platforms like mobile. Lucky for you, Polygon has the time and resources (and the latent exposure to hordes of new releases) to wade through these titles for the gems. Of course, we haven’t played these games yet, in most cases — they’re coming out this week! — but we’ll highlight new work from our favorite developers, newcomers to the scene, and indies that might get lost in the shuffle.</p>
