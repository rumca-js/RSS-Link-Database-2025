        "description": "<p>DeepSeek has unveiled its first-generation DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero models that are designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. DeepSeek-R1-Zero is trained solely through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. According to DeepSeek, this approach has led to the natural emergence of &#8220;numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviours,&#8221; including<a class=\"excerpt-read-more\" href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/deepseek-r1-reasoning-models-rival-openai-in-performance/\" title=\"ReadDeepSeek-R1 reasoning models rival OpenAI in performance\u00a0\">...
