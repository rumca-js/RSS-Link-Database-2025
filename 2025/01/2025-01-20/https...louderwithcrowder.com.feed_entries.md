It would have been nice to let Joe Biden ride off into the retirement home his caregiver, Dr. Jill, dumps him in. And perhaps we still can, but EVERYONE around him needs to be investigated. It is one thing for us to assume Joe Biden is being puppeted around and doesn't know what he's signing. It's another thing to have that CONFIRMED by Mike Johnson, the f*cking SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.</p><p>To set the stage, the press has been handwringing about all the ways Joe Biden's "condition" was "kept hidden."
