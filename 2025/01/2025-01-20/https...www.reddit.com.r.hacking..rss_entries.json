I need to repeat this action hundreds or potentially thousands of times. Whether I use a PC or a phone is irrelevant. Both will work just as well.</p> <p>While I am aware that I can build a bot (selenium?) to perform the daily action, the masking of my identity, with 100 or more requests coming from the same PC, IP, ISP etc is what I&#39;m trying to avoid here. Ideally, my connection should look identical to that of a typical user who is only using one account.</p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

It&#39;s about seeing what others do not and approaching problems from unconventional angles\u200b\u200b.</li> <li><strong>Non-Linear Learning</strong>: Learning doesn&#39;t have to follow a set path. The hacker mindset involves a non-linear approach to acquiring knowledge, focusing on exploration, and connecting seemingly unrelated dots\u200b\u200b.</li> <li><strong>Tunnel Vision Can Be Dangerous</strong>: The book provides examples of how a narrow focus can",
