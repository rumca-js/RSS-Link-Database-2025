## Show HN: CFRS[] Community Demos: Patterns with turtle graphics using 6 commands

<p>Hello HN!<p>Back in 2023, I introduced CFRS[], a minimalist drawing language with turtle graphics, featuring just six simple commands, through a "Show HN" post (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37956065">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37956065</a>).<p>Since then, I've received a number of creative patterns and animations created using this tiny, esoteric language by the small and friendly community that has since formed around it.  In this post, I intend to share some of these interesting creations with everyone to highlight the ingenuity of their creators.  If you create an interesting demo using this language, please share it in the comments--I'd love to see it!<p>Demos contributed by various HNers: <a href="https://susam.github.io/cfrs/demo.html" rel="nofollow">https://susam.github.io/cfrs/demo.html</a><p>Try CFRS[] here: <a href="https://susam.net/cfrs.html" rel="nofollow">https://susam.net/cfrs.html</a></p>

<p>(Part of) the team who recently reanimated the original ELIZA (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42746506) is now working to reanimate what are often considered the first AIs -- the symbolic heuristic programs built by Newell and co at RAND in the 1950. Most of these programs were written in IPL-V, the fascinating (if ugly) machine level language for a stack machine that was the first to introduce list processing, recursion, and symbolic computing, among other innovations that we take for granted today.<p>There were many implementations of IPL-V. According to the manual (https://bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/ipl/Information_Processing_Language-V_Second_Edition_1964.pdf) implementations existed for at least these machines: B220, CDC 1604 and G-20, Ferranti Mercury, IBM 650, 704, 709-7090, 1620, Philco 2000, UNIVAC 1105 and 1107, and the AN/FSQ-32 (whatever that was). And we know that it was also on the IBM 360 and 7094.<p>If you have access to a code archive for any of these machines,

## Show HN: Personalized Duolingo (Kind of) for Vocabulary Building

<p>Hi! Wanted to share the project I really wanted to have. TLDR; this app lets you create your own list of words and you get a Duolingo-like experience (kind of, still needs a lot of features) practicing those words in their context.<p>My English is not the best but not the worst either. But I realized I can't boost it up after a certain level! In my belief, in order to truly learn a language, you need to be exposed to that language often. Vocabulary is the key factor here if you really want to improve in any language.<p>My experience is that when I read a book to improve my English vocabulary, I encounter words that I don't know so often and my reading gets disturbed. I go look for the meaning, come back, put it in context, re-read it, etc. It didn't work for me. So I tried listening to audiobooks - I listen to the book and read along, and whenever I encounter a word, I write it down. I get these 50 words in 2-3 pages and I ask ChatGPT to give me their meanings. I read them, take t

<p>I'll be here for the next 3 hours and then again at around 4 pm EST for another 3 hours. As usual, there are many possible topics and I'll be guided by whatever you're concerned with but as much as possible - because we've received so many questions about this the past few months - I'd like to focus on the impact of the new administration on U.S. immigration law and policy. Please remember that I can't provide legal advice on specific cases for liability reasons because I won't have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I'll try to do the same in my answers. Thanks!</p>

<p>Instead of playing video and trying to display timing information next to it, how about we build a simulation based on timing data and become able to determine the state of the race at any given point in time based on the few 'radar blips' of sector loop passes we have?<p>This is that. It takes the video and timing material of a 24h race (The IMSA Weathertech Sportscar Championship ROLEX24 at Daytona 2024) - 4 videos hosted on YouTube and a big CSV of laptimes and reimagines how a race replay might look like.<p>It comes with a few non-standard visualizations, and a lot of possibilities for navigation, including navigation based on race events such as flag states, overtakes, pit stops etc.<p>It's a zig program based on raylib running in the browser thanks to emscripten, with a bit of js glue code to control the YouTube player.

## Ask HN: Is anyone making money selling traditional downloadable software?

<p>Curious if any HNers are running successful businesses selling desktop/downloadable software with a one-time payment model - not SaaS, not subscriptions. Something like the old days. How's the market for that? What's your experience with support and updates?</p>
