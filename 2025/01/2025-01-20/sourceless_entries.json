The spin-offs in December, backed by the Bollore family, split Vivendi into four multi-billion-euro companies in a bid to unlock value as the French media conglomerate's overall market capitalisation was estimated to be less than the sum of its parts.  But some of the standalone companies had a weak start,  triggered in part by a lack of information about strategy, some disappointing financial guidance and uncertainty around pay-TV group Canal+'s acquisition of broadcaster MultiChoice, the analysts and investors said.",

Berlin is currently exploring a divestment of its 99.12% stake in Uniper, which had to be nationalised during Europe's energy crisis in 2022, with options ranging from a partial to a full sale of its holding, sources have said.  A sale of Uniper, which is currently valued at 19 billion euros ($19.6 billion) but is likely to be divested at a discount, could become one of Europe's biggest deals in 2025.",

The highly sought-after Bridgewater onshore China strategy eclipsed most rival hedge fund products last year with an eye-popping 37% return.",

A tightening in policy would underscore the central bank's resolve to steadily push up interest rates, now at 0.25%, to near 1% - a level analysts see as neither cooling nor overheating Japan's economy.  At the two-day meeting ending on Friday, the BOJ is likely to raise its short-term policy rate to 0.5% unless Trump's inaugural speech and executive orders upend financial markets, sources have told Reuters.",

        "description": "Mexico's headline and core inflation rates will likely land below 4% in January, deputy central bank governor Jonathan Heath told newspaper Excelsior in a story published on Monday, adding that the bank does not need to exaggerate a restrictive posture.  The central banker's forecast comes as some brace for upward pressure on prices, as the incoming U.S. president, Donald Trump, has threatened blanket tariffs on its southern neighbor's exports to the United States in addition to mass deportations.  In December, Mexico's headline inflation rate eased to 4.21%, according to official data, which also saw the core rate tick up to 3.65%.",

        "description": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization on Monday against what it said was China's \"unfair and illegal\" practice of setting worldwide royalty rates for EU standard essential patents without the patent owner's consent.  The Commission, which oversees the trade policy of the 27-nation European Union, said China had empowered its courts to set worldwide rates for high-tech EU companies, notably in the telecoms sector.  \"This pressures innovative European high-tech companies into lowering their rates on a worldwide basis, thus giving Chinese manufacturers cheaper access to those European technologies unfairly,\" it said in a statement.",

The Fed will continue cutting, albeit on a slower path than had been expected, Guggenheim CIO Anne Walsh told the Reuters Global Markets Forum at the start of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos.  Tariffs expected to be imposed by incoming President Donald Trump will probably not be as punishing as most expect, Walsh said, as long as the dollar remains strong as the reserve currency and the U.S. continues to attract capital.",
