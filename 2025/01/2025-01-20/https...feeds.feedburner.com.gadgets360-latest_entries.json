Fossilised tooth analysis suggests meat was not a major part of their diet. This study, published in Science, challenges the idea that early hominins relied on animal protein for cognitive development. Researchers point out the possibility of insect consumption, such as termites, but no significant mammalian meat consumption. The findings contribute to understanding human evolutionary dietary patterns.",

The fossils, originally discovered in 1914 in the Bahariya Oasis, have now been identified as belonging to a new species, Tameryraptor markgrafi. The newly discovered images revealed key differences from previously classified species, prompting the reclassification. This finding opens new doors for understanding the diversity of dinosaur life in North Africa and highlights the importance of revisiting historical paleontological records to refine our knowledge of prehistoric ecosystems. The fossils were initially lost in a 1944 bombing raid in Germany",

The new image highlights protostars HOPS 150 and HOPS 153, which are playing a key role in shaping their environment. These young stars are still in the process of formation, with the nebula's gas and dust feeding their growth. HOPS 153, in particular, is emitting jets that influence the interstellar medium and nearby star formation. These findings offer valuable insights into the early stages of star development.",

Claims must be filed by May 20, 2025, as per reports. This comes after accusations of anti-competitive practices by Synta Technologies and Ningbo Sunny, which reportedly caused inflated prices and eliminated competition",

This system, revealed through laser-stimulated fluorescence analysis of fossils, included criss-crossing fibres and tube-like structures that provided stiffness. These tails served a dual purpose: aiding flight by stabilising the vanes and playing a role in display behaviours, such as attracting mates. Over time, evolutionary adaptations saw tail lengths significantly reduced, improving flight manoeuvrability. Researchers noted the intricate internal structures and the balance between aerodynamic functionality and display appeal.",

The mosaic, buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, depicts Alexander the Great\u2019s victory over King Darius III. This discovery provides critical insights into ancient art, its preservation and the techniques used in its construction.",
