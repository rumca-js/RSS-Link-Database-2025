When it comes to fighting the climate crisis, one thing that we know we need to do is carbon capture and long-term carbon storage. But researchers have been struggling to find ways to actually get this to work. Which is why they've had to get creative, and one solution they've come up with is... killing trees. It's so crazy, it just might work, and here's how. 

SciShow posts a new video 5 times a week, and our science-backed videos were viewed 140 million times last year. But SciShow has always needed your help to keep going, and that’s true now more than ever! We’re selling limited-edition postcards to help us fund another year of SciShow. Check them out - get access to a secret video, and know that you’ve made a difference.
