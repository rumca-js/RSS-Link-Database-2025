<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I noticed that Sony has a <a href="https://pro.sony/s3/">semi-open S3 bucket</a> where if you have the direct link for a document, you can access it. The main link gives you the keys for the first 1000 links, but I can&#39;t figure out how to get it to list the next 1000 or all of them since it doesn&#39;t provide a continuation-token. </p> <p>A lot of it is indexed by google, but I&#39;m looking for a full list of what&#39;s available, particularly for service manuals for repairing old professional CRT displays. If there&#39;s an alternate way to go about getting this list, I&#39;d definitely be interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Derf_Jagged"> /u/Derf_Jagged </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i62ozn/1000_entries_on_a_s3_bucket_without_continuation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i62ozn/1000_ent

I realize some questions are asked but in the last 12 months there have been new plugins and software that speeds things up.</p> <p>For someone who does not know how to code, what would be the shortest route to scrape from a marketplace (From Chile)?. I just want the name, description, photo and once you click on the product list, get the phone contact. </p> <p>I will continue to research but in the meantime, any hints would be appreciated.</p> <p>cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JYanezez"> /u/JYanezez </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i62l98/easiest_route_to_scraping_a_marketplace_name/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i62l98/easiest_route_to_scraping_a_marketplace_name/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there. I am a product manager currently working on a project that requires news and competitor websites to be scraped. I got 2 devs on my team to build the crawlers, bit turns out that’s not enough to cover all the sources quickly. </p> <p>What I want to achieve is have crawlers setup for 250 websites within a week.</p> <p>To save time, I built a python utility that extracts html using a proxy service, sends the html to gpt4o mini asking it to construct the xpaths based on the html. </p> <p>Now this approach works fine for a static pages, but the LLM is simply hallucinating and giving random Xpaths for client side rendered pages. This hallucination is happening even when I keep the JS render flag as True in the proxy service.</p> <p>I suspect the website’s html does not contain the proper data for LLM to process. Is there something I can do to get the proper Html for JS rendered websites.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am in the process of buying a new PC that will be used for large scale scraping. It will have to be Windows to avoid having to spoof OS. I am split between picking 5950X and 7950X. 5950X seems to be the cheapest CPU per core at higher end but doesn&#39;t support DDR5. How much is RAM speed even important for running dozen or more parallel browser instances? I originally planned to go with at least 64GB capacity but am undecided on speed. Should I opt for the cheaper and older 5950X and subsequently also cheaper MB and RAM? Any other hardware recommendation and discussion for scaling is highly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZenaMeTepe"> /u/ZenaMeTepe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i5qfk2/consumer_hardware_recommendation_for_large/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i5qfk2/consumer_hardwar

It seems like I might have to export all links and then filter them in a spreadsheet, which is a bit more manual than I&#39;d like.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a browser extension that can do this kind of keyword-based link extraction directly? Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_O
