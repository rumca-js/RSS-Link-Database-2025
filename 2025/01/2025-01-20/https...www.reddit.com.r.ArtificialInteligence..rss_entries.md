<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There was a debate in Deep Learning around 2017 that I think is extremely relevant to AI today. </p> <p>For the longest time, we were convinced that Large Batches were worse for generalization- a phenomenon dubbed the Generalization Gap. The conversation seemed to be over with the publication of the paper- “On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima” which came up with (and validated) a very solid hypothesis for why this Generalization Gap occurs.</p> <p>&quot;...numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions — and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation.&quot;</p> <p>There is a lot stated here, so let’s take it s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am looking for an ai that remixes music. I don’t mean remixing as changing genre or any of those things. I mean remixing as in changing locations of certain segments, shortening the music, extending it, etc. I wanted an ai that does all of that while making the music still sound coherent and maybe fills in gaps or translation to make it seamless. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Swapilla"> /u/Swapilla </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i5dzug/is_there_an_ai_for_that_music/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i5dzug/is_there_an_ai_for_that_music/">[comments]</a></span>

## I want the NFL to allow AI to call the plays for one team in a preseason game

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This would be the most-watched preseason game in NFL history. A human play-caller against an AI play-caller. Train an AI on a particular team’s plays from the prior season, have it analyze success rate for various down and distances, the effectiveness of certain plays against certain defensive alignments, etc. You could even train it to call an audible at the line depending on how the defense lines up, and just have it transmit the play or audible straight to the quarterback’s helmet like a coach does. This would be like Stockfish for football. This should be entirely possible in the next 2-3 years if not sooner. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LawrenceSellers"> /u/LawrenceSellers </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i5d1xc/i_want_the_nfl_to_allow_ai_to_call_the_plays_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInt
