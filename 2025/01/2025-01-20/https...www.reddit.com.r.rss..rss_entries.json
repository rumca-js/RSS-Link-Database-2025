I&#39;m pretty happy with what I have, but I&#39;d love to be able to incorporate updated content from websites that lack native RSS. For example reports/white papers published by consultancies like McKinsey. Or insights such as on <a href=\"https://www.msci.com/research-and-insights\">this</a> site. I know there are a bunch of projects like RSS bridge and MORSS, but I can&#39;t seem to get decent results out of them. RSS app seems decent, but is a paid service. Any idea how to incorporate in this app (as a non-technical person relying on AI assistance)? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Accurate-Jump-9679\"> /u/Accurate-Jump-9679 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i5ozf0/processing_websites_without_native_rss/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"h",
