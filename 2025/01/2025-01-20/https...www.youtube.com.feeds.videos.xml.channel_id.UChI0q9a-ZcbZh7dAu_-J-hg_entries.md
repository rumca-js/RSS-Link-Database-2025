While Donald Trump is often perceived as "Cryptos Loyal President"... reality is not so simple. After not one, not two, but three separate meme coin launches have hit the crypto space, each themed around a Trump family member (with possibly more on the way), the question has to be asked, who is this good for? 

Onboarding fresh users into a world of scams, rug pulls and zero sum investment losses while ripping billions of dollars out of other projects, rapidly, and immediately before your own inauguration as leader of the free world... we have to wonder "How much is too much"?

When an incoming president, soon responsible for the appointment of policy makers who will decide the fate of dangerous, unregulated and highly speculative financial assets, is then using those unregulated and extremely volatile assets to take advantage of a generous, but unwitting public, we should all be wondering why, and whether or not it should be allowed to happen.
