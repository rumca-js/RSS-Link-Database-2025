However considering there are variety of different Linux distros to download and with the development of distros like Steam OS.

I would like to be able to change folder icons to be more specific to their contents if that makes sense. For instance the downloads folder automatically has a special icon that is different from the generic folder icon. This downloads icon is applied systemwide across applications. Is there a script or a tool that allows you to for instance make a folder that has `.c` or `.js` files have a special icon to signify that it contains code or to have folders that contain `.jpg` files have a special icon that indicates they contain pictures?</p> <p>I would also settle for something like the Nemo folder icon picker that shows icons instead of absolute paths, but I would want an app like that that only shows folder icons and not all of the other random system icons.
