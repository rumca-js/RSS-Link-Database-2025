When the stage is set for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Warhorse Studios' open-world medieval RPG, it's one of contrasts. The “where” is the Kingdom of Bohemia; the “when” in the early 15th century, following the death of its ruler, Charles IV in 1378. Though his son, Wenceslaus IV, took the throne, his reign left much to be desired. But the ensuing turmoil feels so distant in the initial flythrough, with rolling hills, dense forests teeming with deer, and quaint villages dotting the landscape.

It's not long before we catch up with Henry, aka Hal, in Silver Skalitz or Skaltiz, a settlement in the Sasau region known for its silver mines. It's fairly wealthy but the life of Henry isn't one of affluence – his father, Martin, is a blacksmith and he serves as an apprentice. For the most part, Henry seems fairly happy-go-lucky – lazy and unruly on occasion but otherwise, a good person at heart.

Another BioWare release has come and gone, disappointing many in its wake. Dragon Age: The Veilguard – the follow up to their biggest success story ever in Dragon Age Inquisition – has caused widespread disappointment among players. 

Fans of the rich and textured world BioWare built were disappointed in the game that was plainly the product of a tumultuous development, and an aborted (and misguided) attempt at a live service game. But Veilguard's underperformance is, sadly, not the extent of the story. 

Further layoffs at the studio, high profile departures of yet more veterans from the studio's glory days, and uncertainty around their upcoming projects all mean it has unfortunately never been a worse time to be a BioWare fan. And so, for what feels like the umpteenth time, here's another look at what is going on with BioWare.
