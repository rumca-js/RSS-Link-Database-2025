Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the LA Times, has been promising to restore trust in media over the last few months. Instead, he has launched an escalating campaign of editorial interference that accomplishes exactly the opposite. First, he blocked the paper from publishing an endorsement of Kamala Harris.

There&#8217;s a particularly insidious and cynical form of censorship gaining prominence in America: the weaponization of &#8220;free speech&#8221; rhetoric, combined with abuses of the judicial system and executive power, to actually suppress speech. It&#8217;s a strategy that turns the First Amendment&#8217;s principles inside out, using the language of liberty to justify silencing critics and opponents. [&#8230;]

There are lots of things we could be doing to limit school shootings. But none of those have been tried because most people, lobbyists, and politicians continue to believe issuing &#8220;thoughts and prayers&#8221; statements while standing on children&#8217;s graves is the absolute utmost they should be expected to do.
