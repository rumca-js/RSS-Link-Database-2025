        "description": "Shop Micro Center\u2019s BYO Month: https://micro.center/v67n\n\nI tried to learn the Rust programming language. These are the first 4 or so days, where I start off in the Rust book, get bored because I don't like reading that much, then do some Advent of Code. I dive into the docs and a multitude of online resources to figure out how to do these things in Rust. I've done more than what this video shows, but it's already 1.5 hours long and I didn't fee like editing the rest lol. My plan is to actually get into building something now. I want to build Neofetch, but in Rust, and for NixOS. Sure, there are plenty of CLI tools that already do this, but that's not the point. I thought this would be a fun project, and so far it is. So once I finish it, I'll make a video about the entire build that hopefully isn't this long. But we'll see. Enjoy the video!\n\n0:00 i'm learning rust\n0:40 rust book - introduction\n1:28 rust dev tools & legacy code jabs\n3:04 error messages w/ Ferris\n3:38 starting my rust",
