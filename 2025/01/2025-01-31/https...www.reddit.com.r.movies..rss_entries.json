People are gonna say Back to the Future, Avengers, Interstellar, etc. But those movies are all about the mechanics of time travel. About Time is about the FEELING of it. </p> <p>Most time travel movies are about fixing mistakes or saving the world. This is about a guy trying to live a better life. be a better son, husband, dad. No crazy paradoxes or multiverse headaches. That alone makes it hit way harder than any other time travel movie.</p> <p>Most time travel movies make you wish you could go back and fix stuff.

The first time I saw that scene when I was 11, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing and in agony. It still makes me laugh like an idiot even now; - Blazing Saddles, the infamous farting scene. I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I watched that scene; - Scooby-Doo (the first live-actiom film), the part where Shaggy is farting and then lets loose a good one, unaware that Daphne is standing behind him; - Johnny English, when the title character shows the archbishop&#39;s bottom to the whole world; - Step Brothers, no part in particular as the whole film is just gleefully childish and ",
