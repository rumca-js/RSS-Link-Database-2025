<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I run a small company with a few customers, and we offer a feature that allows direct YouTube video imports. We’ve been using yt-dlp, but due to recent YouTube updates, it’s no longer working. Does anyone know of alternative scrapers with an API specifically designed for companies running multiple instances? It seems like YouTube is detecting and blocking scrapers, especially for businesses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/slithice_xxx"> /u/slithice_xxx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iepb2u/youtube_scraper_api_for_companies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iepb2u/youtube_scraper_api_for_companies/">[comments]</a></span>
