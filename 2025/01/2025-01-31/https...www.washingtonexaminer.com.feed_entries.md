Former President Joe Biden’s departure from the political scene is not just the end of a historical career or a political era. It may represent the last gasp of the founders’ view of a presidential-congressional balance. For over a century, Congress’s power has been eroding, including during Biden’s 2021-25 presidency. Biden, by far the longest-serving [&#8230;]

In January, President Donald Trump returned to the White House, facing a world that is arguably more complicated than when he left the building four years earlier. The war in Ukraine, which will enter its fourth year in February, will take much of Trump’s time as he begins to craft and sell a detailed plan [&#8230;]

Albania’s Sali Berisha is the charismatic champion of his country’s conservative opposition to an aging elite that holds power. Former President Joe Biden, while still in office, tried to get him sentenced to prison for the remainder of his natural life. Biden was helped by ideological left-wing prosecutors bankrolled by billionaire George Soros. Berisha is [&#8230;]

There are certain films that look incredible — on paper. Those films are often put on the “Black List,” a register of the most-loved unproduced screenplays in Hollywood as determined by a survey of Hollywood machers.

When, fresh from his November election victory, President Donald Trump began musing about buying Greenland, repossessing the Panama Canal, and annexing Canada, many people dismissed his visions of territorial acquisition as a Trumpian pipe dream, full of hubris, bluster, and wishful thinking. The cheeky New York Post dubbed his fevered imaginings the “Donroe Doctrine,” calling it a [&#8230;]

Eighty years ago, Franklin D. Roosevelt uttered one of the most absurd lines in a presidential inaugural address, assuring the war-weary nation that “the great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward.” In fact, history has no sides or direction, and societies can both improve and decay.

Few TV offerings are trickier than what screenwriters call a “puzzle box” in its second season.
