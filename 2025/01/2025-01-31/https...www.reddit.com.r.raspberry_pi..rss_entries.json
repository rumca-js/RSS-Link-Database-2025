I bought a 10&quot; touchscreen monitor which has mounts on the back for the Pi. Everything works well, the pi boots and runs from the nvme drive, so no sd card. The monitor works well just like it should... except, on system shut down the active cooling fan powers on and runs full speed even though the pi is off. I researched and found suggestions for modifying the config file, checked my fan cable, etc but every time I would shut down, the fan kicked on and stayed on. Removed the pi from the back of the monitor and connected it to a 27&quot; non touch screen display and shutdown works like it should, the cooling fan shuts down as it should. Re assembled the pi and touchscreen setup and the problem returned. after playing with it a bit I figured out that if I had the usb cable that runs the touch part of the monitor is left disconnected, everything works",
