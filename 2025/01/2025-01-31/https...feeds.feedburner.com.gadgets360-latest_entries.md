A recent error by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) mistakenly classified Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster as a near-Earth asteroid. The object, launched into space aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy in 2018, was briefly listed in the MPC’s database before the error was identified and corrected within hours. This incident highlights growing concerns about the tracking of space debris, particularly human-made objects in deep space. Experts stress the importance of better regulations and tracking systems to prevent such misidentifications and their potential impacts on space missions and astronomical observations.

New research highlights a troubling acceleration in ocean warming, with the rate of temperature rise quadrupling since the 1980s. According to a study in Environmental Research Letters, ocean surface temperatures now rise at 0.27°C per decade, up from 0.06°C. This rapid warming, driven by greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane, is worsening Earth's energy imbalance and contributing to sea level rise, extreme weather, and disruptions to global agriculture. Scientists warn that without significant cuts in fossil fuel use, these trends will worsen in the coming decades.

A new study published in Nature Communications explores the mathematical foundations of creativity. Researchers introduced a model called Edge-Reinforced Random Walk with Triggering (ERRWT) to simulate how new ideas emerge by combining familiar elements. By analysing music habits, literature, and scientific papers, the study found that while discovery rates were similar, individuals arranged ideas uniquely. The research also confirmed that creativity follows Heaps’ law, allowing predictions of innovation trends. These insights could shape future approaches to fostering innovation in science, technology, and the arts.

A new study has uncovered an unexpected globular cluster system in FCC 224, an ultra-diffuse galaxy located in the Fornax cluster. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, researchers found that FCC 224 hosts luminous, overmassive globular clusters with unusual properties. The galaxy’s star clusters exhibit narrow color ranges, lack of a color gradient, and are radially mass-segregated. The findings suggest the galaxy underwent a single-burst star formation event, challenging existing models of globular cluster formation.

A recent study published in The Planetary Science Journal reveals that the moon is still experiencing tectonic activity. Scientists identified 266 small ridges on the far side of the moon, formed within the last 160 to 200 million years. The study suggests these ridges result from geological forces like lunar shrinking and orbital shifts. The findings, supported by crater analysis and past Apollo mission data, could reshape future lunar exploration strategies, impacting infrastructure placement and mission planning. Researchers emphasise the need for advanced tools to further investigate subsurface activity.

NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission has delivered a sample from asteroid Bennu, revealing amino acids, nucleobases, ammonia, and minerals formed in saltwater. These organic compounds, vital to life, suggest that the building blocks for life might have existed in other regions of the early solar system. The discovery of evaporite minerals, including halite and trona, further strengthens the notion that liquid water and complex chemistry were widespread. However, questions about the origins of life and why it remains Earth-bound continue to intrigue researchers.

NASA scientists are closely monitoring asteroid 2024 YR4, a newly discovered 55-metre-wide object with a 1.2% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032. If it collides, it could release energy equivalent to eight megatons of TNT, enough to cause serious regional damage. Currently ranked as a Level 3 threat on the Torino Scale, its classification may change as more data refines its trajectory. Space agencies are exploring asteroid deflection strategies, including kinetic impactors, to mitigate potential threats. While the risk remains low, continued tracking is essential.

SpaceX founder Elon Musk has confirmed that his company will be responsible for returning astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station (ISS) in late March 2025. The astronauts were originally scheduled to return in June 2024 but were delayed due to technical issues with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. NASA had already enlisted SpaceX for their return, but delays in the Crew-9 mission have prolonged their stay. Despite the extended duration, the astronauts are in good health, with Williams adjusting to life in microgravity. President Donald Trump and Musk have both criticised the Biden administration for the delay.

Astronomers have identified mysterious icy objects in the outer Milky Way, raising questions about their nature. These structures, composed of ice and gas, are located in a region where star formation is rare. Despite early detections dating back to 2006-2011, recent observations using the AKARI space telescope and the ALMA array in Chile have provided conflicting distance measurements and unclear findings. The objects are much larger than typical gas clouds, and their composition shows similarities to young stars, but their origins remain unknown. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope could provide answers.

White streaks have been observed weaving through the northern lights, presenting a new atmospheric puzzle. Captured by the TREx mission, these eerie white glows appear alongside traditional red and green auroras or in areas where colourful displays have faded. The phenomenon is not considered an aurora, but its emission pattern shares similarities with STEVE, a purplish plasma band that forms in the atmosphere. Scientists are exploring the forces that might be causing these unusual white emissions, though their exact origin remains unclear. The discovery of these white streaks has opened up new questions about the complex nature of auroral activity and the atmospheric processes that drive such phenomena.
