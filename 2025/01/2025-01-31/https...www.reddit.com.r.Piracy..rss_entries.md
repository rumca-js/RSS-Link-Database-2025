<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. So I much prefer using my MP3 player to listen to music, was never a fan of using my phone, especially now that you require a dongle to do so. Having that mp3 player + wired headphones to keep around it and treat it as one entity to carry around is still the way to go for me. Call me old fashioned I guess, but having to use my phone plus wireless headphones that I can easily lose is just not appealing to me.</p> <p>So when I got a Spotify account, knowing that there are programs that can convert the songs into something I can move to my player made me happy. For a few years, I been using Tunefab specifically.</p> <p>Alas, Spotify finally caught on and blocked my account. I managed to get it back if I promised not to download anymore, but I&#39;m devastated that Spotify gets on you like this. </p> <p>Any solutions to this? Perhaps any converting programs that are more recent and can go undetected by Spotify? Or anything else? After reading so

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;&#39;m a long time pirate, literally since I was a small child (recording VHS tapes my family would rent). I eventually got into pirating video games when I was a bit older. At one point, I had a Gameboy emulator on my phone (was an adult by now), and I&#39;d never played any mainline Pokemon games because I never had a handheld system. After pirating Pokemon Red, I fell in love with the game. I immediately went to GameStop and bought a New 3DS with two Pokemon games, then bought mainline Pokemon games whenever they came out afterwards. Fast forward to about a month ago. I&#39;ve been looking for a new &quot;cozy game&quot; on PlayStation other than Stardew Valley to scratch my itch.
