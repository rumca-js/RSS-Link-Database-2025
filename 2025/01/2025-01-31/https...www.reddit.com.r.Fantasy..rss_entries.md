<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello lovelies,</p> <p>I was thinking about how much I love libraries in visual media and I want to know some of your favorites. Whether it was due to the context or just the aesthetics or both. And what makes each library pop for you?</p> <p>To get things started...</p> <p>The scene in Game of Thrones when Sam reaches the Citadel library brought me so much joy. The grand scale of it was great. Subsequent scenes of it being a bit more moody were also great. The detail of the books being chained was a nice touch.</p> <p>And while it may hardly be enough to be called a library... The closest thing to it in Myst has anchored itself as a classic library vibe with the dark wood and arches over display areas. I attribute the minimal actual books to the limitations on video games in that era.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lilgrassblade"> /u/lilgrassblade </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

The cast of characters in the series are introduced accordingly and have their own unique traits and features as each play a complementary role in the story; the revelations and plot twists are earned; the mystique of the world is realized and established with enough exposition but the right amount of showing and telling; the allegiances, organizations, and lore add intrigue to ; the stakes are nail biting; the emotional moments hit hard; and the ending of the series packs a giant wallop but is conclusive yet leaves the story open for more. </p> <p>I do highly recom
