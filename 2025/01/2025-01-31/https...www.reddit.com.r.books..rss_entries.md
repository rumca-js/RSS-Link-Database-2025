There were a couple intense scenes, but otherwise the book was very boring. The plot is moving so slowly, even for King.

I saw a review of it on some book review youtube channel and he praised it so much aka &quot;life changing&quot; I got really motivated to find and read it. I really wanted to love it, but it just didn&#39;t do it for me. I guess I didn&#39;t really connect with the writing style. Specifically during scenes with a lot of moving parts, I often had a really hard time figuring out what was actually be described. I never felt like I could really visualize very much of what was being described. My favorite parts of the book were the philosophical thought experiments and interpersonal relationships, but I never encountered anything that I haven&#39;t read before in some shape or form, so overall I left feeling somewhat disappointed. At least it wasn&#39;t very long.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/seeingeyegod"> /u/seeingeyegod </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the more creative types of titles (in my opinion) is one that basically gives away the way the book will end, and the question that remains is how the book will get to that ending. It feels counterintuitive, because usually you try to avoid spoiling the ending of a book as much as possible, but it can create a different type of tension. If the title claims the book will end a certain way, but the story seems to go in an opposite directing, you get faced with the dread that everything will go wrong eventually. Or maybe the title is a bit vague; you know <em>something</em> will go wrong, but you don&#39;t know how, or when, or why.</p> <p>For example, the book that prompted this post is called <em>Five Survive</em> by Holly Jackson. It&#39;s about six friends who are trapped in an RV while a sniper is waiting for them outside. Six friends, five survive. I think you can see where this is going. But even so, the story was full of unexpected twists

I can’t help but feel drawn to these kinds of characters and stories; each book differed in style, length, and exposition. But there’s just something about a character who wasn’t initially given the best circumstances, tries to find their place in the word, takes on more adversity than they expected or could handle, and meet an untimely fate. These are not always necessarily villain origin stories, but one can’t help but feel an ounce of sympathy for them. Like why couldn’t the others make an attempt to understand them or leave them alone? Some may criticize that those characters may be a bit selfish, whiny, or unlikable at times. However, how likeable would one be if one was in their situations in the first place? I suppose

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just started this book and man am I struggling hard. Maybe I&#39;m just not intelligent enough for this style of writing, but I am having such a hard time comprehending what the hell is going on. It is just not grabbing me whatsoever. Is this how the entire book is like? I do not understand the appeal at all. I was hopeful about VanderMeer&#39;s work because I really like Annihalation (the movie), but I think this is some of the weirdest most uninituive writing I have ever experienced. I&#39;m like 15 pages in and I already feel like abandoning the book. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ryn4"> /u/Ryn4 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ie2iv1/borne_by_jeff_vandermeer_am_i_missing_something/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ie2iv1/borne_by_jeff_vandermeer_am_i_missing_something/">[comments]</a></span>
