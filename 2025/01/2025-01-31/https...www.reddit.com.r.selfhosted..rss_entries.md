## Looking for Open Source Tools or Golang Libraries for Integrating MQTT with Notification Services

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I have a use case where I previously had an MQTT service running in my cluster. Telegraf was connected to MQTT, Prometheus was connected to Telegraf, and Alertmanager was connected to Prometheus. Based on the rules defined in Prometheus, alerts were sent to Alertmanager, which then sent notifications based on the configured receivers.</p> <p>Now, the services themselves are sending alerts to an MQTT topic. I need an open-source tool that can subscribe to MQTT alert topics and send notifications. This tool should be highly configurable.</p> <p>If there is no open-source tool that listens to MQTT topics and directly sends notifications, I can run a Golang service that listens to MQTT topics and sends alerts to a notification service. Are there any Golang libraries that have the capability to listen to MQTT topics and libraries that can send notifications? If there isn&#39;t a single library, I can use two libraries: one that listens

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Reverse proxies have been an arduous journey for me, but I think I am getting close. Some background about my setup:</p> <ul> <li>All services are on a local network. No exposed traffic necessary/allowed.</li> <li>A Debian server hosts Docker services (installed rootful, bare metal). This includes Nginx Proxy Manager, amongst others.</li> <li>I am using <a href="https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker">this fix</a> to force Docker containers to respect <code>ufw</code> rules.</li> <li>A Raspberry Pi runs Pi-Hole. Internal service domains are all forwarded to the Debian server via DNS. I have tested this with <code>nslookup</code> to confirm domains resolve to the Debian server IP.</li> <li>A wildcard self signed SSL cert has been generated by OpenSSL to use for internal services in NPM.</li> </ul> <p>Here&#39;s where I am stuck. All containers (including NPM) are on their own unique Docker networks, so NPM cannot properly forward the traffic to the co

I am hoping to expose a few services to the internet for use by friends and family, but am unclear on how to properly set up authentication via Authentik for those services. I currently use Nginx Proxy Manager for connecting most of my services, so the best option that I&#39;ve come up with is something like the following diagram. I&#39;m a little new to both NPM and Authentik, so open to thoughts.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/fjaz2dyxn8ge1.jpg?width=621&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd6bfb9231afe64f63014977fde0b5c7604a8bf6">https://pr

## Need advice - NocoDB, Grist, Airtable - what other tools are out that offer branding and geolocation

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve got a use case I&#39;m working on for a non-profit and I&#39;m having trouble finding the right tool among all the fremium offerings these days. I thought NocoDB was it, but the paywalled logo feature is probably going to knock it out of contention. I&#39;m looking to build a database, not a very big one, but something that we will be able to create focused views on to help the people using it update just the relevant information within their scope.</p> <p>Is there something out there that I&#39;m not coming across that is low-code, relational, can create an input form and allow the org&#39;s logo to be placed on the form without us signing up for a monthly fee we can&#39;t really afford? I also really need the tool to support geocode/geotag as a field type so that on the form it will prompt &quot;share location&quot; on the user&#39;s device when they tap it and record the current location into the field.</p> <p>Thoughts? Suggestions?</p
