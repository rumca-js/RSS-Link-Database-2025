<p>Last year, Google announced changes to its Chrome browser that signaled the end for popular extension uBlock Origin. The ad-blocker’s design put it at odds with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html">Google’s new Manifest v3 requirements</a>, with death as the likely outcome. </p>



<p>The Grim Reaper is here now, with Manifest V3’s full implementation all but complete. If uBlock Origin and other extensions haven’t been taken away from you yet, they very soon will be—so it’s time to jump to a viable alternative ASAP. Going without an ad-blocker is a security risk, as rogue ads can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2417348/even-google-isnt-safe-from-malicious-google-ads.html">push you to phishing sites</a> or <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2385494/this-is-how-dangerous-ma

<p>For video streamers, another price hike just means it’s Tuesday. For music streaming, however, price increases are bigger deals, and they tend to reverberate for everyone. </p>



<p>Take Amazon, which just hiked the price of its individual Music Unlimited plan to $11.99 a month, or $10.99/month for Prime members. The new price is effective immediately for new subscribers, while existing users will see the price hike on their next bill, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/amazon-hikes-prices-for-its-music-unlimited-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch reports</a>. </p>



<p>That price increase brings Amazon’s music streaming prices up to par with Spotify’s, which <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2355208/another-spotify-price-hike-here-are-5-cheaper-options.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rais

<p>Microsoft is indeed making access to OpenAI’s 01 AI reasoning model completely free — but there’s a limitation and one which Microsoft is refusing to tell you about.</p>



<p>Microsoft said Wednesday that it would provide <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593856/save-200-microsoft-makes-hot-ai-models-available-to-windows-for-free.html">access to OpenAI’s o1 model, for free, to Copilot users</a> as part of a toggle option called “Think Deeper.” OpenAI uses the o1 model in its <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/">paid ChatGPT plans</a> and charges $20/mo for “limited” access to the model, and unlimited access to it for a Pro plan costing $200/mo. However, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief of Microsoft’s AI, said that the model would be “free and available,” and “everywhere at no cost” — potentially an enormous discount.</p>

<p>Even in 2025, it can be hard to find a gaming laptop on the smaller side. That’s why the 14-inch Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is so popular. And right now, the 2024 model of this powerful gaming laptop in a surprisingly compact package is <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-8945hs-16gb-lpddr5x-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white/6570270.p?skuId=6570270">a stunning $500 off at Best Buy</a>.</p>



<p>The OLED screen is the definite highlight for me, offering a 2880×1800 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 500 nits of brightness to make games and movies absolutely pop. The 8-core Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU is one of the fastest laptop chips available in consumer designs. And while the discrete GeForce RTX 4060 card isn’t quite as high-end, that AMD-Nvidia combo should be able to handle even the m

<p>Google recently updated Gemini for Workspace, improving what the AI assistant can analyze, understand, and do in Google Sheets. This comes about a year after Google <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/gemini-for-google-workspace">first introduced Gemini for Workspace</a> and brought AI tools to Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more to users who pay for a <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans">Google One AI Premium plan</a> ($19.99 per month).</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/01/generate-charts-and-insights-with-gemini-google-sheets.html">update announcement post</a>, Google explains that Gemini in Sheets is now better at identifying trends and relationships between variables, generating charts to be inserted into spreadsheets, and using Python code to conduct even more advanced analyses.</p>

<p>A new generation of Nvidia graphics cards launched yesterday (not that you can <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">actually buy any of them</a>), so it’s no surprise that there’s a substantial driver update to go along with them. What is surprising is that said drivers aren’t just for the RTX 50-series, though there’s certainly a lot in there for them. The updates also include performance improvements for previous cards as old as the RTX 2080 from 2018.</p>

<p>One thing I always carry with me is a large-capacity power bank because I never want to be caught with a dead phone, laptop, or earbuds. If you don’t have one of your own, now’s your chance to snag one — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-20000mAh-Portable-Charging-3-Output/dp/B0CB1DTFT6/">this 20K Iniu power bank is only $36 right now on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>With its 20,000mAh capacity, this Iniu portable charger has enough juice to fully recharge a MacBook Air or Steam Deck and still have some left over. Or it can recharge your Samsung S23 or iPhone 15 over three times and still keep going with a bit more. It’s universally compatible and works with phones, tablets, laptops, earbuds, smartwatches, and more.</p>



<p>It doesn’t just have a large capacity — while still being TSA-compliant for flights, mind you — but it charges quickly, with a max output

<p>Is there such a thing as having too many charging cables? I don’t think so! In fact, given how fast today’s power banks and charging plugs have gotten, it’s probably time to upgrade <em>your</em> cables.</p>



<p>And now’s a great time to do it because these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-2-Pack-Charging-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B09N94MZG9/">Ugreen USB-C cables are on sale at Amazon</a>. Normally priced at $12, this two-pack is now down to just $8 — on par with a single dolled-up Starbucks drink.</p>



<p>These are USB-C-to-USB-C cables, each supporting 100W of power throughput, so you’ll be able to charge up your phone, laptop, and other devices in the blink of an eye. (Assuming you have an equally fast power bank or wall plug.) But these cables are great for data transfers, too. They’re capable of up to 480Mbps speeds, which is fast enough to tran

<p>Password health is important, but don’t overlook the humble PIN, too. Often just four digits, it stands between bad actors and major parts of your life: your bank account, your smartphone, your home security system.</p>



<p>But most people chose weak, easily guessed PINs for protection. And chances are, you’re one of them.</p>

Turns out, almost one in 10 people rely on the same four-digit code—and it’s stupidly easy to guess.</p>

<p>Invented back in 1971, the floppy disk is remembered as one of the most iconic and reliable disk storage solutions. Specifically, it was the 3.5-inch floppy that became a literal icon, one we still use today on buttons meant for saving data (even as Gen Zers scratch their heads over it).</p>



<p>Today, the 3.5-inch floppy disk is out of production, but you might have a few in your possession. Can you still use them on modern PCs? Surprisingly, yes! Windows 11 can handle them without too much pain. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
