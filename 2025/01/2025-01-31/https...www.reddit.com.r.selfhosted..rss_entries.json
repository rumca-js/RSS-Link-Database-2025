        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;ve got a use case I&#39;m working on for a non-profit and I&#39;m having trouble finding the right tool among all the fremium offerings these days. I thought NocoDB was it, but the paywalled logo feature is probably going to knock it out of contention. I&#39;m looking to build a database, not a very big one, but something that we will be able to create focused views on to help the people using it update just the relevant information within their scope.</p> <p>Is there something out there that I&#39;m not coming across that is low-code, relational, can create an input form and allow the org&#39;s logo to be placed on the form without us signing up for a monthly fee we can&#39;t really afford? I also really need the tool to support geocode/geotag as a field type so that on the form it will prompt &quot;share location&quot; on the user&#39;s device when they tap it and record the current location into the field.</p> <p>Thoughts? Suggestions?</p",
