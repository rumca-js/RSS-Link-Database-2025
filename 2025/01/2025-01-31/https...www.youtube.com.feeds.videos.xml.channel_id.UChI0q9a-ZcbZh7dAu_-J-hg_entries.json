        "description": "After DeepSeek rocked the AI and Technology markets with its unexpected and disruptive release... (even tanking NVIDIA in the process) OpenAI has moved on to a world class of projection, as they appear to be fixating on the idea that DeepSeek \"improperly\" used their data, to train its model.\n\nThis is a comedic notion, given the fact that OpenAI are possibly histories most prolific data thieves of the modern era, harvesting an untold but substantial portion of humanities collectives outputs in order to train their own AI program.\n\nIn the end, we have a philosophical question... Is it morally acceptable to steal from a thief\n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nQuin69TVs Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmEe3eUPWq4&t=659s\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\n",
