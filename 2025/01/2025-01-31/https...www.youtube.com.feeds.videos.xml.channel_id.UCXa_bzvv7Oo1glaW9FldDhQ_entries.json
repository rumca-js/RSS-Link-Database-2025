The \u201cwhere\u201d is the Kingdom of Bohemia; the \u201cwhen\u201d in the early 15th century, following the death of its ruler, Charles IV in 1378. Though his son, Wenceslaus IV, took the throne, his reign left much to be desired. But the ensuing turmoil feels so distant in the initial flythrough, with rolling hills, dense forests teeming with deer, and quaint villages dotting the landscape.\n\nIt's not long before we catch up with Henry, aka Hal, in Silver Skalitz or Skaltiz, a settlement in the Sasau region known for its silver mines. It's fairly wealthy but the life of Henry isn't one of affluence \u2013 his father, Martin, is a blacksmith and he serves as an apprentice. For the most part, Henry seems fairly happy-go-lucky \u2013 lazy and unruly on occasion but otherwise, a good person at heart.\n\nCheck out our full recap of the story of Kingdom Come Deliverance before you play Kingdom Come De",

        "description": "Another BioWare release has come and gone, disappointing many in its wake. Dragon Age: The Veilguard \u2013 the follow up to their biggest success story ever in Dragon Age Inquisition \u2013 has caused widespread disappointment among players. \n\nFans of the rich and textured world BioWare built were disappointed in the game that was plainly the product of a tumultuous development, and an aborted (and misguided) attempt at a live service game. But Veilguard's underperformance is, sadly, not the extent of the story. \n\nFurther layoffs at the studio, high profile departures of yet more veterans from the studio's glory days, and uncertainty around their upcoming projects all mean it has unfortunately never been a worse time to be a BioWare fan. And so, for what feels like the umpteenth time, here's another look at what is going on with BioWare.",
