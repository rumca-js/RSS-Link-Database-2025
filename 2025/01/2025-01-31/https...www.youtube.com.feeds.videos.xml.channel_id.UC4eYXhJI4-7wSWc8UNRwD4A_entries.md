If you want it, Faye Webster’s Tiny Desk can offer an escape. Featuring her longtime band and a string quartet, Webster guides us through a swooning and sweeping set culled from her quickly growing catalog. 

Webster’s Underdressed at the Symphony was inspired by just that: Buying last-minute tickets to the symphony orchestra in her hometown of Atlanta and finding the experience otherworldly. She performs “But Not Kiss” and the title track from that album. Webster is a gentle but captivating performer in this space, at times grooving with her locked-in band. But she also appears to be in a trance of her own, like on the Atlanta Millionaires Club cuts “Jonny” and its spoken-word reprise. The horns heard on those original recordings gave everything a brassy warmth, but here Trey Pollard’s string arrangements enhance this Tiny Desk’s dream-like quality.
