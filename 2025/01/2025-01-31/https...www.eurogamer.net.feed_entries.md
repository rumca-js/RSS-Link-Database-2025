<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SNIPER-SITE_VlDC076.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Rebellion has a strong track record of delivering great games with its in-house tech. The proprietary Asura engine delivers solid performance across a range of platforms, including the Nintendo Switch. But there's definitely a sense that the core engine technology is of a distinctly last-gen vintage, lacking certain key features we've come to associate with current-generation software. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>, is another cross-gen title - so it's probably best to temper technical expectations somewhat - but has the engine been pushed further than 2022's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-5">Sniper Elite 5</a> and how does performance and image quality fare across all four current-gen consoles?</p> <p><a href="https://www.eu

## 40 years on, Rescue on Fractalus! remains a rare reminder of the magic of Lucasfilm games

Depending on when video games were most formative for you, it could bring to mind any number of other games. It might be Titania in Starfox, Beggar's Canyon in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, or maybe Roca Roja in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/40-years-on-rescue-on-fractalus-remains-a-rare-reminder-of-the-magic-of-lucasfilm-games">Read more</a></p>

## It's taken eight years, but finally Game Pass is positioned to save the Xbox console business and give Xbox a point

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/mechagamepass.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>My son is all-in on Xbox. On the TV he only plays Xbox. He prefers the Xbox UI and services (not that he'd use that term, he's not a robot), the Xbox controller, and the fact that he has Game Pass on there. He has multiple Xbox hoodies and bemoaned the lack of an Xbox birthday cake in the supermarket that was selling a PlayStation-branded one. When I ask him if he thinks he'll prefer PlayStation one day, he's typically pre-teen: "Why would I?" he replies as if talking to the world's dumbest man. He's not a console warrior, but it's fair to say that Xbox is his life.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-positioned-to-save-the-xbox-console-business">Read more</a></p>

Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by controversial streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm, is shutting its doors, four months after making "significant" layoffs. The news comes as Google announces it's lifting Beahm's YouTube monetisation ban, which was put in place following his admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last year.
