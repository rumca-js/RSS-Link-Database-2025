<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So basically one day I woke up and logged into youtube,but then I saw in my watch history someone was watching weird Nigerian movies I never even heard of. At first I didn&#39;t think much of it but as they kept watching more and more and more it started to get annoying. So I logged off every device and changed my password. But it still kept going. And I knew there was nothing I could do. But today, the hacker started posting literal FETISH on my reddit. So I tried to do something about it but it just continues. So yeah.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Flashy-Shame8695"> /u/Flashy-Shame8695 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ie83t8/someone_hacked_my_google_account/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ie83t8/someone_hacked_my_google_account/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. So I interracted with someone in last year on Snapchat and I ended up giving him my WhatsApp number. Now, the person keeps harassing and bullying me online. He keeps creating different accounts both on WhatsApp and Snapchat and I’m honestly getting scared. Is there a way I can get assistance in getting his identity, even if it’s just a name or image. I’d really appreciate anything. Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ijustdontlikepeople"> /u/ijustdontlikepeople </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ie2cco/get_an_identity_of_someone_harassing_me_online/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ie2cco/get_an_identity_of_someone_harassing_me_online/">[comments]</a></span>
