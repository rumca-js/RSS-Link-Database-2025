<ul><li>France 43-0 Wales</li><li>Welsh losing run continues as Les Bleus prove too strong</li></ul><p>Worrying times for the Welsh, worrying times for anyone who has a game coming up against this French team in the coming weeks. They started the 2025 Six Nations by beating Wales 43-0, and they did it without coming anywhere near the tempo they’re capable of playing. The only blemish for the French was a red card for Romain Ntamack, who was sent off for a high tackle on Dan Edwards when there were ten minutes left to play. It didn’t make much difference this week, but, (who knows?) it may do next one, when they play England at Twickenham.</p><p>The Welsh looked awful small out there, surrounded by flames, fireworks, and the blindingly bright blue, red and white lights, while their handful of travelling fans were drowned out by the tens of thousands of French belting out an unaccompanied La Marseillaise. Their skipper Jac Morgan gathered them into a huddle, and did his best to steel t

<p>An adventure in Scandinavian baking, from starter to finish</p><p>In Scandinavia, people are crazy about cardamom buns. They’re usually much drier than I’d like, and after much testing I’ve found that the secret to making a much moister bun is underproofing the dough. Normally, baking something that’s underproofed is nothing but disappointing, but in this instance it’s the way to go. A slightly underproofed centre lets the dough hold on to that sticky, gooey texture you want in a cardamom (or cinnamon) bun.</p><p>This is an edited extract from Bread, by Richard Hart, published by Hardie Grant at £28.

Or passion.

Bridget Jones fans have been grieving since 2013, when Helen Fielding’s third novel, Mad About the Boy, was published sans Bridget’s hot human-rights lawyer husband. The outcry made front page news (as did the copies that were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24479822">accidentally printed</a> with 40 pages from David Jason’s memoir). People could not believe that romcom’s favourite reindeer-jumper-wearing dish, who proved that –<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRnuZlyWXI8"> ding dong!</a> – nice men <em>do</em> kiss like that, was no more.</p><p>“Someone ran out of the pub shouting: ‘You’ve murdered Colin Firth!’”<strong> </strong>Fielding says over a video call, tulips arranged on a huge wooden table in the background, as well they should i

<p>A patchwork of armed opposition groups have made major gains over the past year, with the military facing further losses </p><p>The streets of Lashio, a once bustling city in north-eastern Myanmar, are quieter than usual. Schools are shut, except for those run by volunteers from the pro-democracy resistance in the community. Months of airstrikes have left destruction.

Some died in their homes,” said Leo*, a 40-year-old driver, whose family spent months living with constant bombardments by the military, running to hide in the darkness of a homemade bunker each time jet fighters came.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.co
