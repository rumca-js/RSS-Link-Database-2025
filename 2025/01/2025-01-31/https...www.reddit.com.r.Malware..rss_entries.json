He&#39;s 90 years old so he isn&#39;t surfing anything but his bank, some news sites, and a handful of other legit sites. I&#39;m guessing this is resulting from malicious/unvetted Google (or other) ads? </p> <p>Is there any danger presented from these type popups if he ignores them?</p> <p>What is the solution to these? Simply turning off the computer&#39;s notifications?</p> <p>I realize that I&#39;m asking questions expecting a blanket, one size fits all, type solution. But, I think in general, this popup probably is mostly similar in its iterations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tprickett\"> /u/tprickett </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1iepk55/call_microsoft_support_popup_need_information/\">",
