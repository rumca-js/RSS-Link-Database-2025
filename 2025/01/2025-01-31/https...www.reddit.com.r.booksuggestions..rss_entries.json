There are several well-founded scientific elements - such as prime numbers, means of decoding, the frequency of hydrogen, etc. - that make the narrative even more interesting. It is very different from science fiction stories about aliens invading Earth with laser beams, for example.</p> <p>That&#39;s why I would like to hear suggestions for other books in this style: science fiction that is actually scientific.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CodyRick\"> /u/CodyRick </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ieijv5/books_similar_to_contact_by_carl_sagan/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ieijv5/books_simil",

(very long)</p> <p>I&#39;m looking at getting some books, as I haven&#39;t read any books in quite a while. I&#39;m looking for some suggestions on what is good to read, I&#39;m into sci-fi/space, fantasy/magic, action, post apocalyptic, dystopian and Viking movies and I do also play video games so I was hoping to get some suggestions focused around these genres please (or any others relating to the ones mentioned above). I don&#39;t mind if there is some romance between characters, I just don&#39;t believe I&#39;ll be interested in a full romance novel. If that makes sense. </p> <p>Below are a list of books I&#39;m interested in buying/know I want:</p> <ul> <li> A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones)</li> <li>Hunger Games</li> <li>Silo Trilogy (recently watched the series, it&#39;s amazing would recommend).</li> <li>The Mazerunner</li> <li>Lord of The Rings</li> <li>Harry Potter</li>",

I don\u2019t necessarily need the full on mental illness themes of The Bell Jar and (to an extent) Nightbitch. I\u2019m more so looking for the scenes they all contain of a woman who finds herself unable to envision the future she original\u2019y planned for herself and who deals with those struggles through devouring things and/or acting out sexually and/or self-harm. Kind of something that speaks to gifted kid burnout/feeling down about having to reimagine life expectations that combines it with lust and/or gluttony imagery. Definitely open to horror, as I know horror is usually where gluttony and lust imagery is at its strongest in depictions of women. Would prefer the book to have a female author or a femi",

I haven\u2019t read allll the books in each of these series i listed, but i like to hop around a bit and i\u2019m always trying to look for books that are like the Alien Barbarians of Zandipor.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently finished the ACOTAR series because everyone and their mamas were raving about it, but I ended up being quite disappointed in the writing, and eventually the story itself. I was also recommended Fourth Wing which--don&#39;t get me wrong I liked the idea--was even worse than ACOTAR. I&#39;m not super keen on the romance aspect of it, specifically not the smut of it all, and those books read like a teenage girl&#39;s fanfic. I&#39;ll hand it to them, they did get me interested in reading fantasy; however, being that they are my only references, I&#39;m a little lost on finding something that I&#39;d actually enjoy. Does anyone have some good recommendations? Good writing, interesting story, worldbuilding, etc. Extra points if there are dragons. Thank you, and I&#39;m sorry if you enjoyed those books.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dipperpupp\"> /u/dipperpupp </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",

I\u2019m looking for something that maybe has similar vibes to the Half-Life series of games, or the game Mouthwashing. I really enjoy the concept of mundane work turning into something awful, as well as isolation and what it does to the mind. </p> <p>I put <em>possibly queer</em> in my title because I\u2019m open to recommendations that aren\u2019t queer, and even with the ones that are I don\u2019t want it to be a huge focus (no big dramatic coming out scenes, sorry) but rather a fact of the character(s). </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thesilliestsailor\"> /u/thesilliestsailor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ie1lif/looking_for_suggestions_of_possibly_queer_horror/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1",
