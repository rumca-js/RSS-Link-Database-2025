        "description": "A recent error by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) mistakenly classified Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster as a near-Earth asteroid. The object, launched into space aboard SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy in 2018, was briefly listed in the MPC\u2019s database before the error was identified and corrected within hours. This incident highlights growing concerns about the tracking of space debris, particularly human-made objects in deep space. Experts stress the importance of better regulations and tracking systems to prevent such misidentifications and their potential impacts on space missions and astronomical observations.",

According to a study in Environmental Research Letters, ocean surface temperatures now rise at 0.27\u00b0C per decade, up from 0.06\u00b0C. This rapid warming, driven by greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane, is worsening Earth's energy imbalance and contributing to sea level rise, extreme weather, and disruptions to global agriculture. Scientists warn that without significant cuts in fossil fuel use, these trends will worsen in the coming decades.",

Researchers introduced a model called Edge-Reinforced Random Walk with Triggering (ERRWT) to simulate how new ideas emerge by combining familiar elements. By analysing music habits, literature, and scientific papers, the study found that while discovery rates were similar, individuals arranged ideas uniquely. The research also confirmed that creativity follows Heaps\u2019 law, allowing predictions of innovation trends. These insights could shape future approaches to fostering innovation in science, technology, and the arts.",

The galaxy\u2019s star clusters exhibit narrow color ranges, lack of a color gradient, and are radially mass-segregated.

The study suggests these ridges result from geological forces like lunar shrinking and orbital shifts. The findings, supported by crater analysis and past Apollo mission data, could reshape future lunar exploration strategies, impacting infrastructure placement and mission planning.

The astronauts were originally scheduled to return in June 2024 but were delayed due to technical issues with Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft. NASA had already enlisted SpaceX for their return, but delays in the Crew-9 mission have prolonged their stay. Despite the extended duration, the astronauts are in good health, with Williams adjusting to life in microgravity. President Donald Trump and Musk have both criticised the Biden administration for the delay.",

These structures, composed of ice and gas, are located in a region where star formation is rare. Despite early detections dating back to 2006-2011, recent observations using the AKARI space telescope and the ALMA array in Chile have provided conflicting distance measurements and unclear findings. The objects are much larger than typical gas clouds, and their composition shows similarities to young stars, but their origins remain unknown. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope could provide answers.",

        "description": "White streaks have been observed weaving through the northern lights, presenting a new atmospheric puzzle. Captured by the TREx mission, these eerie white glows appear alongside traditional red and green auroras or in areas where colourful displays have faded. The phenomenon is not considered an aurora, but its emission pattern shares similarities with STEVE, a purplish plasma band that forms in the atmosphere. Scientists are exploring the forces that might be causing these unusual white emissions, though their exact origin remains unclear. The discovery of these white streaks has opened up new questions about the complex nature of auroral activity and the atmospheric processes that drive such phenomena.",

Scientists used ESM3, an AI model trained on billions of natural protein sequences, to design a functional protein beyond evolutionary constraints. The development is expected to accelerate medical research, drug discovery, and biotechnology. Experts acknowledge the innovation but stress that AI-driven protein design does not replicate the complexities of natural selection. The study has been peer-reviewed and published in Science.",
