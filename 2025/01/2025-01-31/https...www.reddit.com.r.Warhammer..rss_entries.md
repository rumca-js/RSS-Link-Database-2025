My sister in law and I love to give them a hard time about them geeking out over it. All in all, we love watching them get excited and so immersed into the game and thought it would be fun to closet collect on the side for awhile and be able to surprise them one day and maybe play with them in the future. We just know that they will absolutely soil their britches when they find out. </p> <p>We are looking for opinions on what some of you consider to be the most diabolical and disgraceful factions.

I&#39;ve been wanting to get into reading the Warhammer novels for quite some time (and Warhammer in general) but there are so many of them that it&#39;s hard to know where to begin. However, I absolutely love Paul Kearney as an author - his Monarchies of God books are amongst my very favourite books ever written - so when I found out he&#39;d written a Warhammer trilogy, I was immediately interested.</p> <p>However, with there being so much lore, and with the books and universe being so expansive, I wanted to ask - can I read Calgar&#39;s Siege, Calgar&#39;s Fury, and Calgar&#39;s Reckoning as an entry point without having read anything else? Thank you in advance for your responses!</p> <p>EDIT: Actually, it looks like the only two books published are Calgar&#39;s Siege and Calgar&#39;s Fury, with Calgar&#39;s Reckoning still unpublished after quite a few years. So it would also be helpful if anyone cou
