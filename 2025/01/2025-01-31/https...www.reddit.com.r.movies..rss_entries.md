<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About Time is one of the best time travel movies ever made. People are gonna say Back to the Future, Avengers, Interstellar, etc. But those movies are all about the mechanics of time travel. About Time is about the FEELING of it. </p> <p>Most time travel movies are about fixing mistakes or saving the world. This is about a guy trying to live a better life. be a better son, husband, dad. No crazy paradoxes or multiverse headaches. That alone makes it hit way harder than any other time travel movie.</p> <p>Most time travel movies make you wish you could go back and fix stuff. About Time makes you wanna enjoy what you’ve got right now. </p> <p>HIGHLY recommend. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AppleBottmBeans"> /u/AppleBottmBeans </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iesl2t/about_time_is_one_of_the_greatest_time_travel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://ww

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Following on from my previous question about the saddest songs you know, I thought I&#39;d ask a happier question.</p> <p>I have a good sense of humour and like a good laugh, so there are a few films that have made laugh hard, but the following really made me laugh to the point of tears or agony: - Home Alone 2, when Marv gets electrocuted. The first time I saw that scene when I was 11, I was literally rolling on the floor laughing and in agony. It still makes me laugh like an idiot even now; - Blazing Saddles, the infamous farting scene. I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I watched that scene; - Scooby-Doo (the first live-actiom film), the part where Shaggy is farting and then lets loose a good one, unaware that Daphne is standing behind him; - Johnny English, when the title character shows the archbishop&#39;s bottom to the whole world; - Step Brothers, no part in particular as the whole film is just gleefully childish and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One thing that always fascinated me about movies when growing up was the worlds that they created. But some of the more fantastic worlds, I thought, would have been a dream to work on. </p> <p>I wasn&#39;t sure how <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> was filmed until I checked out the behind the scenes documentary specifically to find out about both the village and the forest. How did they do that in the day? Turns out, the village was 100% real, built from the ground up for the movie, and the forest was a set designers dream, constructed on apparently the &quot;world&#39;s largest soundstage&quot; (my original post was going to be about what other movies have immersive soundstage scenes in them).</p> <p>But soundstages need not be the limit here.

He plays <strong>Jacob</strong>, a lonely, mentally challenged man caught up in a doomed money scheme, and it’s heartbreaking. The way he captures Jacob’s childlike trust and growing unease is <strong>some of the best character work I’ve ever seen.</strong> There’s nothing showy about it—just a raw, vulnerable performance that sticks with you.</p> <p>🔥 <strong>Fargo (2014, Season 1)</strong> – Lorne Malvo. One of the best TV villains of all time. <strong>Every word out of his mouth is chilling, darkly hilarious, or both.</strong> Whether he’s psychologically dismantling someone
