<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Mostly asking cause 1. Thought it might be a good project to simple learn how Linux works (especially if I go through LFS) and 2. Mainly cause I am curious why there are different Linux distributions out there.</p> <p>From a couple of people I talked to, mostly it not worth the time unless you just want to experiments. However considering there are variety of different Linux distros to download and with the development of distros like Steam OS. I got curious as to what reason there would be to actually build one yourself.</p> <p>Experimentation with different packages/programs? Design philosophy you are trying to achieve? Maybe make something you think would work better outside the conventional options for Linux?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zak_the_Reaper"> /u/Zak_the_Reaper </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iepyhk/what_are_some_reasons_to_make_your_own_distro

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using GNOME with nautilus but this question should apply to more than just that. I would like to be able to change folder icons to be more specific to their contents if that makes sense. For instance the downloads folder automatically has a special icon that is different from the generic folder icon. This downloads icon is applied systemwide across applications. Is there a script or a tool that allows you to for instance make a folder that has `.c` or `.js` files have a special icon to signify that it contains code or to have folders that contain `.jpg` files have a special icon that indicates they contain pictures?</p> <p>I would also settle for something like the Nemo folder icon picker that shows icons instead of absolute paths, but I would want an app like that that only shows folder icons and not all of the other random system icons.
