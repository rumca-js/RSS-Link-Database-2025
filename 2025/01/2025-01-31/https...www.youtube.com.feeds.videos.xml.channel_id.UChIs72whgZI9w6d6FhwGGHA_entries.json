        "description": "Sponsor: Antec Flux Pro case on Amazon https://geni.us/CaPv\nThis video talks about NVIDIA's paper launch of the RTX 5090 in addition to its launch of the RTX 5080 that no one wants. We crawl through the internet to try and learn more about just how low the inventory and stock was, as well as share our own experiences of trying (and failing) to buy any RTX 5090 GPUs on launch day. We also spoke with numerous people in the industry to try and learn more, and it does look like the 5090 is lower supply than the RTX 4090 was at launch.\n\nWatch our review of a GPU no one can find at retailers here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWSlOC_jiLQ\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
