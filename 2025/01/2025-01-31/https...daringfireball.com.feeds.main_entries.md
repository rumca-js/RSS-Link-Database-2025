  <p>“It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that
corruption is the name of the game,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.,
Mass.) said in a statement. “After Meta pays to play, what does
Mark Zuckerberg expect as a return on this investment?”</p>

<p>Serious talks about the suit, which had seen little activity since
fall 2023, began after Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, flew to
Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to dine with him in November,
according to the people familiar with the discussions. The dinner
was one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the
relationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also
donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump

  <p>The recent work I’ve been doing has required a lot of sharing
files between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the
ideal tool for this but I’ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p>

<p>Instead I’ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop
alternative and it’s been working fantastically. The only real
downside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the
share to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that’s a
tradeoff I’ll happily make.</p>

<p>Somehow I’d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It’s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229">in the App Store</a> and <a href="https://localsend.org/download">via the web</a>.

  <p>Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2025 first
quarter ended December 28, 2024. The Company posted quarterly
revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent year over year, and

over year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Probably most notable is that iPhone revenue was down 1% from the
year-ago quarter, which will certainly upset some analysts and
investors, given that the iPhone is more than half of Apple’s
total revenue. But the Mac jumped 16%, the iPad was up 15%, and
services was up 14%. The recently sluggish Wearables, Home, and
Accessories category was down 2%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sales were down 11 percent in China companywide, which is surely what pulled the iPhone down. Outside China iPhone 16 sales must be very
