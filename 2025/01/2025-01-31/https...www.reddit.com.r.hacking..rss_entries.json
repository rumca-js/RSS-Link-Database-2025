So if you&#39;re dumping a stream and the stream pauses, you will never see the last data that was received unless it paused at exactly a 16-byte boundary.</p> <p>What I&#39;m looking for is an hex viewer (probably ncurses-based) that would update both the hex section and the ascii section of its output as soon a new byte is read, even if that doesn&#39;t result in a full line of output.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/acut3hack\"> /u/acut3hack </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iefsui/hex_viewer_that_works_well_on_streams/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackin",
