<p>If you’ve been shopping around for a gaming laptop, do me a favor and pump the breaks–you’ve got to take a few things into consideration first. A powerful GPU is needed for keeping up with the latest games, but if you’re looking for the most cost-effective option, you can easily pick up a laptop with a budget GPU that will play 1080p at 30 fps. The display should also have a high enough refresh rate to handle faster paced games, thus resulting in smoother motion and a clearer image.</p>



<p>If you’re not sure where to begin, don’t sweat it. Every laptop you see below has been tested by a member of the PCWorld team and we’ve checked everything from graphics performance and typing experience to connectivity options and display quality. </p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust us:</strong> It’s in our name! PCWorld prides itself on laptop experience and expe

<p>Nvidia has mostly been in the news lately for its GeForce RTX 50-series cards and DLSS 4 technology, which is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2583939/nvidias-dlss-4-is-so-much-more-than-just-fake-frames.html">way more than just “fake frames.”</a> But the company has been working in other directions as well, including a recent update to the Nvidia Broadcast app.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/studio-ai-geforce-rtx-50-series-broadcast/">announcement post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603518/nvidia-broadcast-ai-studio-voice-virtual-key-light">The Verge</a>), Nvidia outlines two new AI features that were just added in. The one that catches our attention? Studio Voice, which “enhances a user’s microphone to match that of a high-quality microphone.” According to The Verge, a real-world test showed that St

<p>Having a fast flash drive on hand can save you the pain of transferring files over slow Wi-Fi. In fact, it allows you to bypass the need for an internet connection altogether. It just so happens that one of our favorites — Samsung’s Type-C Flash Drive — is on sale right now, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Type-CTM-Transfers-Compatible-Waterproof/dp/B09WB2RPS4/">128GB model available for a mere $18 on Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>Besides the fact that this modern flash drive is a total steal at this price, this particular model is awesome because, as the name suggests, it has a USB-C connection. That means it’s so easy to back up data from smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, and more.</p>



<p>The Samsung Type-C Flash Drive is compact, too, making it easy to throw into a pocket or purse and take with you anywhere. It’s also built wit
