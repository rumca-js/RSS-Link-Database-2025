## Ski Resort Closures and Opportunities for Sustainability in North America

More than half of the ski resorts in North America have closed since the early building booms—many facing a warming climate and pressures to find water to make artificial snow. Researching and documenting all resorts between 1969–2019, we find that 59% of all resorts in North America have closed since the resort boom of the 1960s and 70s (65% in the United States, 31% in Canada). This shift has left some states or provinces with only one or no resorts remaining. To proactively persevere with a variable climate, less water, and a need for more energy to make snow, we suggest mountains holistically plan for sustainability. Recommendations include third party environmental certification, commitment to sustainability at the management level, communication to customers about sustainability practices and implementing unique models for remaining open and competitive. These practices include resort consolidation, multi-mountain passes, and/or unique ownership models. We believe that ski reso
