I am using my Steam Controller.</p> <p>The game seems to be using some sort of default controller configuration that I cannot change through Steam. It works, but it&#39;s far from ideal.</p> <p>I can&#39;t get the Steam overlay to work which is probably the culprit. Tried disabling/re-enabling the overlay as well as Steam Input but no luck.
