## Can I build digital scenarios for firefighters with any tools?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I’m a firefighter and use software to make digital scenarios of incidents for training. For example I go and take a load of 360 photos of a building and do a slide show of escalation of the incident. We used to have a proper VR for this but far too expensive so have this now. The issue is the software is slow to build the scenarios and once they are built they are one directional so inputs during training sessions won’t impact the next slide. I’m wondering if there’s a better tool where I can edit fire/explosions etc onto my background photos. Maybe even do this in real time based on the input of the people being trained/assessed? Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwawaybdhd"> /u/Throwawaybdhd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ieo5jq/can_i_build_digital_scenarios_for_firefighters/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I often hear people saying that AI companies are running out of data to train on. But... what about the new data? That is, every year humanity uploads ever larger amounts of data to the web. Blogs, websites, youtube, tiktok, reddit... Feels like the amount uploaded doubles every few years...<br/> So... how are we running out of data? What am I missing? </p> <p>If it&#39;s about *access* to data, then yeah, that could limit some ai groups, but a) players like google and meta have access to new data, and b) lots of companies are already data mining and selling it in legal ways. (Not to mention that the digification of everything is also making new kinds of data, e.g. fitbit data, smarthouse data, etc.) Plus, once robots start getting out there, they&#39;ll be collecting 3d real world data all over the place. </p> <p>So yeah, what am I missing? thanks everyone </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jewish
