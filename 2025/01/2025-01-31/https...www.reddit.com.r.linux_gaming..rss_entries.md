The worlds were static environments, nothing moved or changed, but they reacted to you and your weapons. You could load plastic explosives in to your ship and replace an entire lake with explosives, then shoot it and create a huge bomb. Or if you dropped a bunch of thermite around and shot that, it would spread like wildfire and torch all the wooden structures and grass and trees.</p> <p>I don’t think there was any story in the game, I just remember horsing around with that little ship and destroying various sandbox maps with it.</p> <p>If anybody has any idea what that game was, I’d be happy

It led me to explore Linux distros on old computers and get some familiarity. I am now taking the plunge and building my first gaming pc with the intent of running Bazzite to start. Based on my skill level at the moment I like it being an immutable distro and just working out of the box pretty much. Obviously the similarities to Steam OS are nice as well.</p> <p>I&#39;ve taken a shot at putting together a first build and would like to get some thoughts. I would like it to be somewhat future proof, with my thought being that if I am taking the time and money now to make this, I would rather not continuously update unless I have to.</p> <p>Money is not really an issue. However, that said, I don&#39;t just have pools of money to toss out for no reason, and I am not looking to buy the newest shiniest th

I have it set to 5 minutes because I have an OLED monitor and I might forget to lock my screen and walk away for longer times so 5 minutes is perfect for me in my day to day use.</p> <p>Is there a way I can disable it when running the game? like a steam start code that disables it temporary or something? I can run like a video in the background that prevents it from happening, but at that point I can also manually change the setting. I&#39;m just worried that I forget to change it back. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Manufacturer_8213"> /u/Ok_Manufacturer_8213 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1

## Nvidia Wayland isn't ready for gaming

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using Wayland on my Laptop and it&#39;s great for touchpads! But unfortunately it&#39;s not ready for gaming yet.</p> <p>With openSUSE Tumbleweed updating its Nvidia driver version to 570.86.16 I decided to test Wayland on my gaming pc. Literal disaster:</p> <p>My Setup: Nvidia 3070 (570.86.16 driver), KDE Plasma 6.2.5, openSUSE Tumbleweed 20250128, 1x 1920x1080 144hz G-Sync compatible screen (primary, DP), 1x 1920x1080 144hz screen (DP -&gt; DVI-D).</p> <p>- The cursor is absolutely not smooth. The whole system feels slightly &quot;unsmooth&quot; (a tiny bit laggy), but it&#39;s most noticeable for the mouse cursor.</p> <p>- Enabling Adaptive Sync for my primary screen (the reason why you would use Wayland over X11 for gaming, isn&#39;t it?) makes the cursor a disaster. It&#39;s lagging terrible, jumping over the screen. 100% unusable.</p> <p>- Games couldn&#39;t detect my refresh rate. With V-Sync enabled or in main menus, if the game locks

So I installed Arch just to find out that steam downloads rates are excessively bad, getting like 20-30mbps when I have a 1Gbps connection. I checked already with SpeedTest and I&#39;m getting my max download rate, so no problem there. I&#39;m installing in an M.2 Nvme drive so no problem there I suppose, so...</p> <p>I tried everything that I could find on reddit, Arch Wiki, Arch Forums and even Debian forums and I still can

I tried to use openrgb but it failed with the fans and i dont know how to configure the program. SignalRGB worked. This was all on Windows. </p> <p>I really want to swap to Linux, but i dont know how to overcome the issue. My last idea was to use a Windows VM with the only purpose of controlling SignalRGB.
