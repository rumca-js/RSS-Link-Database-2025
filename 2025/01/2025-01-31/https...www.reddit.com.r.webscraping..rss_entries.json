We\u2019ve been using yt-dlp, but due to recent YouTube updates, it\u2019s no longer working. Does anyone know of alternative scrapers with an API specifically designed for companies running multiple instances? It seems like YouTube is detecting and blocking scrapers, especially for businesses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/slithice_xxx\"> /u/slithice_xxx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iepb2u/youtube_scraper_api_for_companies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1iepb2u/youtube_scraper_api_for_companies/\">[comments]</a></span>",
