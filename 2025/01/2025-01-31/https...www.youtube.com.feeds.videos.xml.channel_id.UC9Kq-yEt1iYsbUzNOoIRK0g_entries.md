The first season of Squid Game was a surprise massive hit for Netflix back when we were all locked inside of our homes. Can a new season, several years later still big as big of a success?

Squid Game Season 2 definitely raises some questions. Like wait, what happened last time? Why isn’t Gi-Hun suspicious of 001, the guy who has the same number as the last guy who infiltrated the games? What’s his big plan of raiding the head office all about? Are any of these storylines going to be resolved this season? Is this actually a season?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for Squid Game Season 2!
