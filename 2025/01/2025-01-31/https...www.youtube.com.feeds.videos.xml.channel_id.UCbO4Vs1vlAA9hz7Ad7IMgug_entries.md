Welcome back to TACTICAL AWARENESS - a Canadian Podcast about Corvus Belli’s landmark Sci-Fi Wargame; Infinity N5. Come along with our hosts Ash, Owen and Dan for a whole new ITS Edition of Infinity! 

It's Hot Takes time as we dive into the finally-relased ITS 16.5 Document. Missions have returned, rules have changed and generally the tweaks are in for this lane-shift medium way through the season. Let's go!
