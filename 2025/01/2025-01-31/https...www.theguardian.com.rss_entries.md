<p>RFK Jr’s proposal to remove fluoride from tap water is a matter for debate.

Having lived in both countries for an extensive period, the UK, in my opinion, takes a more sensible approach to implementing pro-health and wellbeing policies, closely linked to EU regulations.

It’s a line that feels very on brand. Hurry Up Tomorrow’s release has been promoted with billboards declaring “THE END IS NEAR”, social media posts in which Tesfaye has inferred the album is the final “beautiful chapter” in his story and interviews during which he’s suggested that a 2022 incident in which he lost his voice on stage was some kind of cosmic message: “You can end it now … when is the right time to leave if not at your peak?”</p><p>It is perhaps worth noting that the same was true of his last album mor

But that would make me the predator and I think I’m the prey here.

Although – further honesty alert! – he’s not really hunting me. We’ll come to that.</p><p>I’m trying to remember what Grylls said in his brief about how to avoid detection. A lot of things beginning with S: sound obviously, though it’s hard to be quiet here because the forest floor is covered in dry leaves and twigs.

All of it was achieved against a backdrop of addiction and personal struggles that she did not hide.</p><p>When the 17-year-old Faithfull was spotted by the Rolling Stones’ manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, at a Stones launch party in 1964, she had already been taking tentative steps as a folk singer.

<p>I was wearing white, and foolishly imagined I’d emerge unsplattered </p><p><a href="https://www.krokodilos.co.uk/">Krokodilos</a>, a new Greek restaurant, has spread out its tail and claws in Kensington. This sleek, moderately fancy celebration of all things from Athens to the coast of Crete is currently working hard to channel a sun-kissed sojourn on the Aegean, in winter, in London. Yet step inside, away from the concrete and drizzle outside, and the place is airy, opulent and verging on the semi-Californian. This is movie-set Greece hewn in tones of dappled, early evening Athenian sunshine, all bronze, peach, tan and gold, and enhanced with tasteful lighting, velvety soft furnishings and comfortable leather banquettes. Before I walked in, I was just a woman in thermals with a flaky nose, but then – bang! – I’m suddenly Christina Onassis sipping a mulberry <em>mou</em><em>rnoraki</em> in a rustic yet dashingly chic taverna.</p><p>All this and a kitchen headed by <a href="https:/

So it is with Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and Rachel Reeves’s attempts to kickstart the economy.

They know it’s true but refuse to acknowledge it and, more importantly, to do anything about it.</p><p>There is, however, nothing comical about this situation.

The Six Nations is a quarter of a century old.

<p>If, like me, you store seeds for future planting, it’s worth checking they will germinate. Luckily, the process is simple</p><p>I like to think of myself as an organised person, but if you met my seed box, you may disagree. It’s a recycled shoe box that once housed wellies, with cardboard dividing it into&nbsp;compartments labelled by plant family. Each section is a chaos of packets, envelopes, little jars and paper folded around seeds that have been bought, shared and saved. Not everything is labelled, some packets are empty and many of the seeds have&nbsp;been hanging around for too&nbsp;many years to still be fertile.</p><p>Seeds don’t last for ever, unfortunately. Their viability varies&nbsp;depending on how long they have been&nbsp;stored, the conditions they have been stored in and the type of seed – onion seeds, for example, are&nbsp;best sown within a year&nbsp;or two, whereas cucumber and kale seeds can&nbsp;be stored for about five years.&nbsp; Generally speaking, a&nbsp

<p>There are narrow parameters to this Ethan Hawke-narrated documentary – the conflict’s effects on the US. But it’s a valuable reflection packed with emotional, moving tales from penitent soldiers whose lives were torn apart</p><p>For the US and its allies, postwar foreign policy conforms to a pattern. In the planning and execution stages, this new war is strategically essential and a moral imperative, and anyone who says otherwise is a traitor; decades on, when it’s too late, it’s admitted that the same war was a folly or perhaps even a crime. Usually, though, the war was bad because of what it did to the US, not what it did to the other nations involved.</p><p>The six-part documentary series Vietnam: The War That Changed America sticks to that brief. There are a handful of Vietnamese interviewees, and the extent of the carnage wrought upon the country’s people is touched upon, but the subject matter is the effect the war had on the psyches of US soldiers – and on the mindset of th

<p>David Lynch’s classic about a man who rides his lawnmower across America.

In this regard, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/27/classic-american-road-movie-david-lynch-straight-story">The Straight Story</a> serves as a career outlier. However, despite lacking all his trademark dread and disquiet, it deserves to go down as one of his very best. Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, a man who, in 1994, took his 5mph lawnmower on a 240-mile road trip to visit his sick brother, it shimmers with awestruck wonder. Lead actor Richard Farnsworth was in the latter stages of terminal cancer during filming, and his stubborn determination to see the journey through is reflected throug

This gathering was a shimli, a Welsh word that falls from the tongue with a similar softness to Carmarthenshire folk singer Owen Shiers’s delivery of these 11 quietly political songs.</p><p>Recording as Cynefin (a Welsh word for a place where we feel we belong), Shiers’s second album mixes traditional ballads, musical settings of poems and originals built on stories collected from rural west Walians, all sung in Welsh.

But now, she says, it’s the music industry that really angers her</p><p>When the singer-songwriter Neko Case was growing up in poverty in rural Washington, it did not occur to her to question her parents or their indifference to her. “Kids don’t think things are weird,” Case, 54, says with a shrug. “It’s like: well, this is my reality, so this is what reality is.” So when Case’s father picked her up from her grandmother’s house one day and told her that her mother had died, from terminal cancer she had kept secret, Case believed him. She attended her mother’s wake with her father, her relatives on her mother’s side and 20 or 30 other mourners.</p><p>About a year and half later, Case left school to find her dad waiting unexpectedly. He informed her that her mother was at home, apparently back from the dead. Case was told that her mother had faked her death to spare her family

Gibson was a young Australian who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated multiple cancer pathologies via a range of dietary tricks and alternative medicines. This glossy, pacy dramatisation of Gibson’s deadly tissue of lies is distinguished by a fine, nuanced central performance from Kaitlyn Dever, who portrays Gibson as corrupted and parasitical but also desperately needy and in denial about the true gravity and consequences of her actions. <em><br>
