<p>GoPro is rolling out a <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gopros-tiny-179-4k-hero-camera-now-captures-ultra-wide-immersive-video-with-new-43-video-setting-and-superview-digital-lens-settings-302364232.html">software update for its entry-level Hero camera</a> that allows users to shoot 4:3 video in 4K. This is great for the kinds of clips that populate social media sites like TikTok, as the footage is taller. The update is available for free via the company’s GoPro Quik app on iOS and Android.</p> 
<p>Obviously, the new aspect ratio is intended for social media content, but shooting in 4:3 has several use case scenarios. For instance, it can be the perfect choice for capturing video from a first-person perspective. If social media isn’t your bag, GoPro says that these 4:3 videos can easily be cropped to 16:9 "for a traditional widescreen look."&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Hacking experts allege that this was a “zero-click” attack, meaning that the targeted users wouldn’t have had to click on a nefarious link to get infected. This is a similar method to another large-scale WhatsApp hack, in which spyware called Pegasu

In it, the council said that Meta&#39;s policy shift &quot;risks prioritizing political ideologies over global safety imperatives.&quot; It highlights how Meta&#39;s position as one of the world&#39;s most influential companies gives it the power to influence not just online behavior, but also societal norms. The company risks &quot;normalizing harmful behaviors and undermining years of social progress... by dialing back protections for protected communities,&quot; the letter reads.&nbsp;</p>

But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be.

If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html">foldables</a> — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.<br><br>At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years.

<p>Uber has filed a racketeering suit against a group of legal firms and medical professionals, claiming they staged car crashes and performed unnecessary surgeries to commit insurance fraud, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/uber-alleges-fraud-scheme-by-ny-groups-faking-car-crash-injuries?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported. The group allegedly recruited passengers involved in purported or minor vehicle collisions and provided &quot;medical unnecessary... [sometimes] invasive and painful surgeries like spinal fusions,&quot; according to the federal suit filed in Brooklyn yesterday.</p>
<p>Driving the alleged racket is New York&#39;s no-fault insurance, particularly as it applies to cab and rideshare chauffeurs. The city forces those workers to carry personal injury coverage up to $200,000, four times that required for individual drivers — providing potential scammers with lucrative targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the span of a week, the Chinese startup DeepSeek has completely disrupted the AI landscape with its free and "open source" R1 model. In this episode, Devindra, Engadget Senior Reporter Igor Bonifacic and Producer Ben Ellman dive into what makes R1 so special, and what DeepSeek is doing differently from OpenAI and other competitors. Also, we try to figure out what’s up with “Incention,” a weird AI/blockchain project for creating new Hollywood IP, and wonder if Helion’s fusion reactor is actually legit.</p>
