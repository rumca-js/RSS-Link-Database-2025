For instance, it can be the perfect choice for capturing video from a first-person perspective. If social media isn\u2019t your bag, GoPro says that these 4:3 videos can easily be cropped to 16:9 \"for a traditional widescreen look.\"&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>There\u2019s another tool available with this update",

The group allegedly recruited passengers involved in purported or minor vehicle collisions and provided &quot;medical unnecessary... [sometimes] invasive and painful surgeries like spinal fusions,&quot; according to the federal suit filed in Brooklyn yesterday.</p>\n<p>Driving the alleged racket is New York&#39;s no-fault insurance, particularly as it applies to cab and rideshare chauffeurs. The city forces those workers to carry personal injury coverage up to $200,000, four times that required for individual drivers \u2014 providing potential scammers with lucrative targets.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-",
