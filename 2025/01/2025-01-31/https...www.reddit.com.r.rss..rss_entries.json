I used Wpematico plugin to fetch content from rss feed to post. I used bollywood hungama rss feed url to fetch content. I disabled to redirect to the source url, yes it worked and showing full content of the blog. But when I used other sites rss feed it&#39;s not showing the full content of the blog. I know some sites rss doesn&#39;t allow to show full content of the blog when it doesn&#39;t redirect to the source url. Can someone give me a solution to this? I need to show full content of the blog using rss feed without redirecting to the source url.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_mk_619\"> /u/_mk_619 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ie9esq/i_need_help_with_rss_feed_in_wordpress_to_show/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ww",
