<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The game within the game, The Wild Side, was a prediction of what VR arcades could potentially look like. It used hologram to create a complete different reality. </p> <p>Even though that&#39;s not how VR arcades are like today, the Wild Side still sounds fun, right? Well, there&#39;s just one problem. It was too realistic. The boss escaped and captured players by defeating them at the game. You&#39;d think that after their defeat, the game would shut down so the next person could play, but nope. Players were trapped in that virtual world with no hope of escaping unless someone beats the final boss at the end. </p> <p>Let&#39;s be real, if there was a VR arcades that glitches up that badly, there would be serious lawsuits against the Wild Side&#39;s developers. Forget someone trying to beat the final boss at the end, professional hackers would have to get involved to save these trapped players, and the game would have to be recalled globally. </p> <p

They did include exact dimensions along with accurate front profile pictures. They only indicated the width of the whole camera (8.91 inches at its widest) and did not specify the IPD. </p> <p>Well, after some very careful measurements using the dimensions along with the focal center of the lens in the picture, I have deduced with a bit of proportional math that the IPD will be 64 mm!!!</p> <p>IPD directly affects just how “3D” a 3D image is.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had my index for years and it&#39;s struggling to stay alive right now. I got new knuckles like a year ago and I really like them and still want to use them. am I better off getting another index? or wait for a new headset to be released? or is there a better headset? i was hoping for something with facial tracking that easily let&#39;s me use my lnuckles/vive trakers with it? I&#39;m guessing it would have to be compatible with the same basestations/lighthouses. i dont care as much about specs but i dont want the visual differencd to be too extreme. any info is greatly appreciated!! thanks :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoComplex6345"> /u/NoComplex6345 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ie42hu/which_headset_should_i_get_if_i_want_to_use_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ie42hu/which_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m about to get a big payday on my last contract as a digital marketer, and I&#39;m going to get into VR. I&#39;m willing to spend around $1k if I really need to, but I&#39;d prefer something half that. I don&#39;t want anything associated with Meta. I&#39;m going to be using this headset only with my PC, so I doubt I need the headset to be standalone. </p> <p>Desktop PC specs are high. 64GB DDR5 I think at 6000MhZ, NVME, Ryzen 7 7800X3D 8-Core Processor, about four other SSDs and four storage HDDs, for the moment using a 2080 Super with a 1070 for secondary processing, but I can upgrade.</p> <p>___</p> <p>I was looking at the Valve Index, but it seems to be quite old at this point? Then there was Pimax, which seems neat.</p> <p>I do wear pretty thick glasses, my vision is terrible.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have never used a vr headset before (except the plastic box thingies where you attach your phone into, but that dont count) and i will be getting a powerfull pc probably this summer or atleast this year, a big upgrade from my laptop. </p> <p>And i really want to get into vr, mostly for gaming, and maybe sometimes watching movies and such. I have already made a ton of research, ik about the fan and ipd problem, but i dont think i will mind the fan and my ipd is pretty normal i think so it probably wont be a problem. I dont want a standalone headset because connecting those to a pc seem very finicky and i dont want video compression. Other than that i like the idea of standalone but it aint for my use cases.</p> <p>I havent seen any better pcvr only headsets with great specs like this, i know the price isnt as good as buying a quest 3 or even a pico, but i told why i didnt want those.</p> <p>And my budget is around 600 dollars, but it will be changin
