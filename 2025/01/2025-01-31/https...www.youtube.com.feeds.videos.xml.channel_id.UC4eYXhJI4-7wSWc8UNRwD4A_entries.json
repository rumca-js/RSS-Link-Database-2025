        "description": "Elle Mannion | January 31, 2025\nIf you want it, Faye Webster\u2019s Tiny Desk can offer an escape. Featuring her longtime band and a string quartet, Webster guides us through a swooning and sweeping set culled from her quickly growing catalog. \n\nWebster\u2019s Underdressed at the Symphony was inspired by just that: Buying last-minute tickets to the symphony orchestra in her hometown of Atlanta and finding the experience otherworldly. She performs \u201cBut Not Kiss\u201d and the title track from that album. Webster is a gentle but captivating performer in this space, at times grooving with her locked-in band. But she also appears to be in a trance of her own, like on the Atlanta Millionaires Club cuts \u201cJonny\u201d and its spoken-word reprise. The horns heard on those original recordings gave everything a brassy warmth, but here Trey Pollard\u2019s string arrangements enhance this Tiny Desk\u2019s dream-like quality. \n\nSET LIST\n\u201cIn A Good Way\u201d\n\u201cBut Not Kiss\u201d\n\u201cUnderdressed at the Symphony\u201d\n\u201cJonny\u201d\n\u201cJonny (Reprise)\u201d\n\nMUS",
