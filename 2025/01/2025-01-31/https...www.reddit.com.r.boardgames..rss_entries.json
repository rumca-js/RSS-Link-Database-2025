I started with the fire started deck and tried by every way possible to make a flip deck work, to no avail. I managed to snag some good gnome man&#39;s land cards that went pretty well but got 3rd on the first and second tournaments and got 4th on the last one by 4 points or something like that. I tried get some gold promos but the ones we used gave points for each of one element and type, which was anti-synergistic with my strategy, so I basically wasted lots of cards on promos (we made sure to not look any card beforehand so as not to have any info before playing).</p> <p>So, do you guys have any beginner tips to get better at the game? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Karrion42\"> /u/Karrion42 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/board",

It had a colourful board with a long winding path made up of different coloured squares (similar to candy land). These squares were coloured red, blue and yellow? (or green? or both?) and had corresponding cards to go along with it. The different colours of the cards required you to do different things, all of which I have forgotten. The only one I can remember is that one of the actions you had to perform on a red(?) card was to act like a dead fly. If your piece landed on a red square, you&#39;d pick up a red card and do what it says and same applies to each of the other different colours. I would like to say the outer casing of the game was yellow, but I&#39;m really not too sure.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My wife and I have been playing Sky Team for almost a month and up until this point we were loving the game. Today I realized that we were playing the game wrong because we were discussing possible dice values and placements as part of our communications before each round. We just got done playing the first two missions over again while following the no dice discussion rule and we really felt like it took away from the experience. Because we could not discuss dice strategy we found ourselves going straight into the rounds because there was very little to actually discuss. The intense conversations we had and strategy was replaced with boredom. For those of you that have played Sky Team, what are your thoughts on our observations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Charlie_Milatz\"> /u/Charlie_Milatz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ie47kh/sky_teams_preround_comm",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I&#39;ve recently got into board games &amp; been loving it so far. I wanted to add an ocean/ sea themed game to my collection &amp; was stuck deciding between these 2 games which I&#39;ve read a few reviews each of. We usually play at 2 players &amp; love strategy games. I originally decided to go with Oceans because I&#39;ve read it&#39;s more strategic &amp; the art+tokens look super cute! but was tabling it till I could collect some dispensable income to feed this new found passion of boardgames. But I just spotted an Aquatica piece on FB marketplace so I&#39;m back to being confused on whether to get oceans or aquatica.

A couple of months ago, I picked up 7 Wonders and have been playing it twice a week since and having a lot of fun, and wanted to get another game.</p> <p>Recently, after seeing some posts online recommending it, I impulse bought Root from my local hobby shop for $80 CAD. However, I haven\u2019t played it yet, and after doing some more research, I\u2019m starting to feel a bit of buyer\u2019s remorse.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of comments saying that <em>Root</em> is extremely difficult to learn, that it&#39;s easy to drown really early making a come back impossible turning the game into a slog, and that it\u2019s overall not very enjoyable. Since I\u2019ve already opened the game, returning it isn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>For those who have played Root, is it really as complex and frustrating ",
