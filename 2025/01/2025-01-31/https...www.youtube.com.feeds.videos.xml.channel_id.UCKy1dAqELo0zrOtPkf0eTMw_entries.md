## Bloodborne 60FPS Mod Viscerally Attacked By Sony Lawyers - IGN Daily Fix

In today's Daily Fix:
A popular patch for Bloodborne was hit with the DMCA copyright attack from Sony. The patch, which only runs on the emulated version of the game on PC, offered smooth 60fps gameplay—something fans have been clamoring for since the game was released back in 2015. So far, Sony has made no mention of any enhancements for the base game or a remaster for PS5 or PC, but this takedown notice has fueled some speculation that a remaster running at 60 frames is on the way. In other news, Forza Horizon 5 will be coming to PS5 later this year. This is the latest in a string of first-party Microsoft games that were once exclusive to Xbox now coming to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles. A Switch 2 port of the game is also rumored. And finally, WB's Smash Bros-like platform fighter MultiVersus is shutting down. Season 5 will be the final season for that game. The new season begins next week and will run through May, afterwhich online play will be disabled.

Hello Kitty Island Adventure reviewed by Shailyn Cotten on Nintendo Switch, also available on PC and mobile.

For fans of Sanrio's lovable cast of characters, Hello Kitty Island Adventure might scratch an itch left in the wake of Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the broadest sense. On the surface, its large and colorful world, cutesy critters, and never-ending to-do list feel energetic and new. But sadly, that surface is all there is. A shallow pool of endless gifting and mindless tasks are locked behind daily progression gates to distract you from the fact that you are, in fact, never getting anywhere fast.

Ninja Gaiden 2 Black reviewed by Will Borger on Xbox Series X, also available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over Sigma 2, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black.

In today's Daily Fix:
Layoffs have hit BioWare as the company restructures to focus on the next Mass Effect game. Some of the staff from Dragon Age: The Veilguard have reportedly been let go, while others have been moved to other teams. Dragon Age: The Veilguard apparently did not meet financial expectations from BioWare, but the game did achieve critical success. IN other news, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards are sold out everwhere, but gamers with deep pockets can find them on eBay...for three times the price. Some of the 5090 cards are going for as much as $6,000, way up from the MSRP of $2K. And finally, the PlayStation anniversary themes for the PS5 are going away, but maybe temporarily. Sony is looking to keep them on your system for good if you want them, and maybe this will open up the path for more custom themes like on the PS3 and PS4.
