<p>OpenAI on Friday released the latest model in its reasoning series, o3-mini, both in ChatGPT and its application programming interface (API). It had been in preview since December 2024.</p>



<p>The company said in its announcement that it “advances the boundaries of what small models can achieve, delivering exceptional STEM capabilities — with particular strength in science, math, and coding — all while maintaining the low cost and reduced latency of OpenAI o1-mini.”</p>



<p>OpenAI said that o3-mini delivered math and factuality responses 24% faster than o1-mini, with medium reasoning effort, and testers preferred its answers to those generated by o1-mini more than half the time.</p>

<p>Microsoft calls the functionality itself “Think Deeper.” The o1 model spends more time (about 30 seconds) considering the instructions it receives from several different angles and perspectives, then delivers a more comprehensive response than most genAI tools.</p>
