Pride was a celebration of hard earned rights, but guess what? Now we have to go back to our stone wall origins and fight back for the rights that were taken away from our siblings in the community. It&#39;s not a celebration anymore, it&#39;s a FIGHT for our RIGHTS!</p> <p>Here&#39;s the kicker though I can&#39;t fight. One because I&#39;m not in America, and two because I live in a radically homophobic country where if you come out you&#39;re either jailed for years or institutionlized.

It is not a fucken choice, I gen didn&#39;t believe people except boomers actually thought it was a choice. Being gay has and will ruin my entire life, I will never live a happy life. I just want basic human rights, which includes parents accepting me, but no. I have been sent to the mental hospital due to my mental health because of being gay. I&#39;ve know I was gay since year 4 and now I&#39;m year 12, I could nag for $1000 cash straight up to celebrate no more pain, but I just want a hug; someone to tell me &#39;its ok, I really hoped you would have a husband and kids, but that&#39;s what I wanted. I want you to be happy, I can&#39;t wait to meet your future wife.&#39; Literally that&#39;s it. You don&#39;t need to attend pride. Fuck I&#39;m so desperate you can even vote against gay marriage.
