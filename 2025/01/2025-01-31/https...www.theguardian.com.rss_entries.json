Ivan is a 22-year-old chess champion with a degree in theoretical physics and former \u201cincel\u201d tendencies, while Peter is a human rights lawyer in his 30s pining for his former girlfriend, Sylvia. Peter is also sleeping with Naomi, a student in her early 20s who sells nude pictures of herself online and who regularly taps him for cash.</p><p>Set in Dublin and rural west Ireland, this fourth novel from the Normal People author Sally Rooney draws on familiar themes of modern relationships, though here they are underpinned by grief. While Ivan tries to understand and process the loss of his father, Peter prefers to distract himself from his feelings with alcohol and prescription drugs.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/31/intermezzo-by-sal",

Yet step inside, away from the concrete and drizzle outside, and the place is airy, opulent and verging on the semi-Californian. This is movie-set Greece hewn in tones of dappled, early evening Athenian sunshine, all bronze, peach, tan and gold, and enhanced with tasteful lighting, velvety soft furnishings and comfortable leather banquettes.
