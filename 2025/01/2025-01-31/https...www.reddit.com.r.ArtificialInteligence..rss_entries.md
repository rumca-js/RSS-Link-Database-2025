<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently rediscovered the latest adult content generated on Civitai, and I was absolutely blown away by the video section. The quality of these generated videos is something that wasn‚Äôt even possible until very recently. As someone who works partly in the adult space, it really got me thinking about where things are headed in the next 3, 5, or even 10 years.</p> <p>For one, just like how Unreal Engine, Unity, and other tools enabled virtually anyone to make video games, tools today are making it super easy for gen artists to make these videos, images, etc as long as you have a fast enough GPU. These tools are already having a profound impact on how people interact with adult media, including online sex work (think adult cams, videos, onlyfans, etc.).</p> <p>If the rate of improvement in computing power continues, we might soon see real time generative AI video. Think about that for sec... Imagine cam sites or platforms where the entire cast is made

## Why is using recordings of famous people and fictional characters to train/generate an AI voice ‚Äúcopyright infringement‚Äù, but being able to impersonate with your own voice is fair game?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw Jehtt&#39;s new video &quot;We&#39;re back at Eggman&#39;s Crypto Mine&quot;. For those who don&#39;t know, Jehtt is a YouTuber who makes memes using material from the Sonic franchise. His videos satirize relevant topics at the time of upload, and he&#39;s generally considered to have based opinions. This video was a scathing criticism of generative AI.</p> <p>The video was, at the very least, on the verge of a bad take, if not a straight-up bad take.</p> <p>Particularly when Tails says, &quot;(The output of generative AI) is powered by theft.&quot;, echoing a stance many people, particularly butthurt artists, have. When they call it &quot;theft&quot;, they&#39;re making the same mistake as the infamous &quot;You wouldn&#39;t steal a...&quot; PSA that was slapped onto every DVD in the 2000s. Theft is the removal of a physical object, depriving the owner of said object. What they&#39;re talking about is copyright infringement, but training gener
