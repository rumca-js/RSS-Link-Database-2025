The dinner\nwas one of several efforts by Zuckerberg and Meta to soften the\nrelationship with Trump and the incoming administration. Meta also\ndonated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund. Last year, Trump\nwarned that Zuckerberg could go to prison if he tried to rig the\nelection against him.</p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of the November dinner, Trump raised the matter of\nthe lawsuit, the people sai",
