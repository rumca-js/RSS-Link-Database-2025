I can&#39;t seem to remember everything, a lot of it is fuzzy. One thing I can remember is the testing. The testing was really strange, I remember having to complete patterns that made no sense. I remember some kind of hearing test, an iq test and doing worksheets with snacks everyday (koolaid and some random snack foods). I&#39;m really wondering about it now. Seeing the actual sheets from the test made me remember it pretty vividly. The thing is, my grades were shit. I&#39;m really curious to hear everyone else&#39;s experiences with it.</p> <p>I can&#39;t be the only person that is starting to remember some of this.
