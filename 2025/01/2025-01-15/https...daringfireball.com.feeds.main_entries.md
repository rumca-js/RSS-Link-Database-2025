<blockquote>
  <p>After pushback on only allowing web apps for the iPhone, Steve
Jobs announced that native apps would be coming to the iPhone. In
the interim, Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall invited
Tim Westergren and his CTO, Tom Conrad, over to a local Cupertino
lunch spot. The trio talked for hours about what Pandora had
learned about streaming audio from putting apps on flip phones,
like Motorola’s RAZR, for wireless carriers. The meeting ended
with a question for Forstall.</p>
