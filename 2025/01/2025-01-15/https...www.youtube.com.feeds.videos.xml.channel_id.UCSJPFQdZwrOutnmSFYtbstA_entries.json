        "description": "Skeleton Crew turned out to be a fun little show, that delivered on its promise for a kid-friendly adventure in the world of Star Wars. The problem is, nobody watched it and the show ended up with lower ratings even than The Acolyte. But how and why did it fail so badly? Was it The Acolyte? Was it saboutaged by Kathleen Kennedy? Was it the lack of big stars and legacy characters? Let's find out together. \n\nWant to help support this channel? \nCheck out the Drinker Merch Store: https://drinkershop.com/\nCheck out my books on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Will-Jordan/e/B00BCO7SA8/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_ebooks_1\nSubscribe on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/TheCriticalDrinker\nSubscribe on Subscribestar: https://www.subscribestar.com/the-critical-drinker",
