<p>If YouTube TV’s latest price hike feels like a breaking point to you, you’re not alone.</p>



<p>Over the last week, I’ve heard from a bunch of folks who say the rate hike—from $73 per month to $83 per month, starting January 13, 2025—is the last straw. They’re now seeking alternatives to YouTube TV that will provide comparable channel coverage for less.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that sort of easy escape hatch doesn’t exist. Like every other live TV service (<a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/1419277/think-streaming-price-hikes-are-bad-cables-are-even-worse.html">including satellite and cable</a>), YouTube TV keeps raising prices because TV programmers keep demanding more money for their channels. Unless the entire industry embraces <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2484386/cable-tv-hits-a-fork-in-the-road.html">cheaper, more flexible bundle

<p>Open AI has now updated the Chat GPT with the new beta feature Tasks, which allows the AI chatbot to perform tasks at a later time. Users simply say what they need and when they need it.</p>



<p>For example, a user can instruct Chat GPT to inform them of current stock prices every morning, remind them of their language studies every evening, or give them a daily 15-minute personal training session.</p>



<p>The Tasks feature is currently being rolled out to Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers. It can be found in the model selector, where it is called “GPT-4o with Scheduled Activities (beta).” Open AI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1879267278371655987">writes </a>that the feature will eventually be available to all Chat GPT users.</p>

<p>One thing you can always use is extra storage space, especially when it comes in the shape of a speedy portable SSD. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-1TB-Portable-SSD-CT1000X9SSD902/dp/B0CGW1FQV4/">This Crucial X9 offers 1TB of space for just $69.78</a> thanks to a sale on Amazon. (It doesn’t show as a sale, but it was $99 up until a couple of days ago.)</p>



<p>The Crucial X9 portable SSD isn’t just great because it allows you to store all your photos, videos, and games offline, but also because it can transfer files quickly. With read speeds of up to 1,050MB/s, this SSD is perfect for moving large files or even editing 4K videos.</p>



<p>It’s also pretty darn small and built to resist a lot, from accidental water exposure and heavy dust environments (thanks to its IP55 rating) to drops from up to 7.5 feet. Your data is safe here.</p>

<p>One thing I rarely leave the house without is my power bank. It gives me peace of mind to know that even if my phone or laptop dies while I’m out, I can always charge them and have them ready.</p>



<p>Don’t have a power bank yet? Here’s a great one worth getting, especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BJQ7F16T/">now that it’s 30 percent off on Amazon</a>. The 25K Ugreen power bank is down to $70, a sizable drop from its usual $100.</p>



<p>This power bank has a massive 25,000mAh capacity, which is enough to charge most phones about five times over. That also means it’s big enough to charge up your laptop without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>It has a max output of 140W when you’re only using the main USB-C port, which is fast enough to charge a MacBook Pro by half in just 30 minutes. But the power ban

<p>There’s a growing trend of developers flexing their muscles to make PDF documents do completely different things than what they’re intended to do. The goal is to push the boundaries of the PDF format.</p>



<p>PDF (which stands for Portable Document Format) was created in 1992 as a way to present documents independently of software, hardware, and operating systems. It’s practical, but it’s also complex — and that’s what makes the format attractive to programmers and malware creators alike. (Where some see security risks, others see a chance to shine.)</p>

<p>For years, owners of Google’s Nest Protect smoke detector have been asking when their devices would make the leap from the older Nest app to Google Home, and the answer was always the same: one day, maybe. </p>



<p>Well, it looks like that day has finally arrived. </p>

<p>Microsoft really, really, <em>really</em> wants you to ditch Windows 10 and upgrade to Windows 11 already. (Better yet, just buy a new PC!) The company says that 2025 is “<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2570602/dont-wait-til-october-to-switch-to-windows-11-security-experts-warn.html">the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh</a>,” and they’re trying their best to will that slogan into reality.</p>



<p>Case in point: A <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-windows-end-of-support-means-for-office-and-microsoft-365-34e28be4-1e4f-4928-b210-3f45d8215595">new support page</a> says that Microsoft Office 365 will lose support on Windows 10 in October, the same time the OS is shelved. “Microsoft 365 apps will no longer be supported on Windows 10 after it reaches end of support on October 14, 2025,” says the page.</p>

<p>Yesterday was January’s big Patch Tuesday, where Microsoft rolled out a big bundle of security updates across several apps and services, eliminating 159 security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>This is the most extensive Patch Tuesday of the last few years with more than double the usual number of fixed security flaws. According to Microsoft, three of the patched Windows security vulnerabilities are already being exploited in the wild, and a further five vulnerabilities were already publicly known in advance.</p>



<p>Microsoft doesn’t offer much information on the vulnerabilities for self-searching in the <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Security Update Guide</a>, but Dustin Childs dives into much more detail on the <a href="https://www.thezdi.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero

<p>Microsoft is currently focusing all they can on Windows 11. Not only did the company recently dub 2025 as the “<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2570602/dont-wait-til-october-to-switch-to-windows-11-security-experts-warn.html">Year of the Windows 11 PC Refresh</a>,” but this year’s CES has been all about Windows 11 and the new Copilot+ PCs that Microsoft has been trying to push.</p>



<p>All of this might come as a surprise, with some industry insiders over the past couple of years assuming that a new version of Windows (christened “Windows 12”) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2160349/report-windows-12-will-release-in-june-2024-taiwans-pc-makers-think.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be released as early as 2024</a>.</p>
