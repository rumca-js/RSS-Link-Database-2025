Naturally, all Git commit hashes have changed.</p> <p>Now, when I try to rebuild my Docker images, I keep running into a weird issue. Despite clearing all images, containers, and even running <code>docker system prune --all --volumes --force</code>, some files seem to be missing from the build.</p> <p>The missing files feel almost randomly selected‚Äîsome are from commits 5 years ago (while others from the same time period persist), and others are recent. I initially thought it might be branch-related, but the pattern of missing files doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p> <p>Has anyone encountered something similar or have ideas on how to troubleshoot this?</
