Today&#39;s paper is titled &#39;CodeCoR: An LLM-Based Self-Reflective Multi-Agent Framework for Code Generation&#39; by Ruwei Pan, Hongyu Zhang, and Chao Liu.</p> <p>This research explores the challenges in generating syntactically and semantically correct code using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. While LLMs have shown impressive results in code generation, their outputs are often not robust due to the reliance on sequential workflows. To address this, the authors propose CodeCoR, a multi-agent framework featuring four specialized agents for prompting, coding, testing, and repairing, aimed at enhancing collaboration and self-reflection within the code generation process.</p> <p>Here are some key findings from the paper:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Self-Reflective Workflow</strong>: CodeCoR integrates a self-reflective wor

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed a tendency in AI discussions to blur the line between what AI systems like LLMs actually <em>do</em> and what we think they’re doing. Specifically, there’s a habit of projecting human-like qualities onto systems that operate very differently from human cognition. This often stems from confusing <em>subjects</em> (the process or entity doing the &quot;thinking&quot;) with <em>objects</em> (the output associated with that process/entity).</p> <p>Consider this example: imagine you train a neural network on a dataset of orbital trajectories. It observes positions, velocities, and times, then becomes remarkably good at predicting where a satellite will be at a specific moment. But that doesn’t mean it has <em>discovered</em> Newtonian mechanics or Kepler’s laws. Instead, it has performed a sophisticated form of induction, identifying patterns in the data and generalizing them. These patterns indirectly reflect orbital laws because the data it
