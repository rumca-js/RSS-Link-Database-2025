We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Four, the first of 2025! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres!

Today we're checking out the seventh issue of BLASTER, with Jordan Cuffie's ARSENAL. I've paired this minis-agnostic Mecha Combat game with SolCorps... and Brick Building mech combat indie skirmish for a game I think deserves more Hype!
