<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed increasingly that the majority of software I&#39;m using has fully baked well designed mobile layouts when scaled to a phone aspect ratio. In addition to this, gnome has been developing its mobile layout for years now. Files, epiphany, gapless, camera, calendar, most apps you really need on a phone are there and in a good state. From what I can tell, you could have an extremely usable mobile linux experience nowadays. (compared to back when the pinephone was a thing)</p> <p>This might be me, but I feel like I could, at this point, have a complete mobile experience with minimal complaints (that is, other than gnome&#39;s atrocious onscreen keyboard)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wyboss"> /u/Wyboss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i26d7q/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_gnome_ecosystem_as_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
