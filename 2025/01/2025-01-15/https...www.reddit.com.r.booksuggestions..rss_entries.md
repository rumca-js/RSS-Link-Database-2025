<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to read semi regularly but haven‚Äôt completed a book in ten years due to my wrecked attention span from smart phones.</p> <p>My favorite books are The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway and Slaughter House Five by Kurt Vonnegut. I like that both books are concise and don‚Äôt meander. I like that they focus on characters and life themes rather than a plot points.</p> <p>I also like Harry Potter but not because of the mystery or plot but because it creates a world. The day in the life school parts are my favorite parts. It feels like I am visiting another culture.</p> <p>My favorite current TV show is The Bear because it focuses on interesting characters and how they interact with each other.</p> <p>I just started reading Bossy Pants by Tiny Fey which is a funny memoir. I like it because it‚Äôs concise and funny.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trick-Interaction396"> /u/Trick-Intera

## Medieval Horror meets Fantasy?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a bookworm, I love to read and always have. My boyfriend however was not much of a reader, but in light of it being one of my favourite hobbies he has begun to pick up reading. He is on book three of 2025 already! We decided to have our own little bookclub, with each of us choosing a book for every month. I read quite a diverse range of books, and while I want to widen his horizons, I don&#39;t want to choose something he will find boring. He favours medieval horror, dark monster-esque stories - Berserk is one of his passion topics. He also loves anything inspired by HP. I would love to indoctrinate him to read a fantasy novel (a soft spot for me), but I am unsure of what to recommend. So can anyone recommend me a fantasy novel with more darker/medieval/horror/HP themes? Does such a book exist? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Amphitrit3"> /u/Amphitrit3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.

Quickly fell off when my mental health declined.</p> <p>I don&#39;t read much, or at all anymore. I read No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai when I was in the psych ward, and I enjoyed it a lot. The writing wasn&#39;t &#39;story&#39; driven, it was more like a conversation between an author&#39;s more personal character&#39;s thoughts and feelings, and the reader. That&#39;s it.</p> <p>I found a poetry book, called A boy without his feathers by Beau Taplin. Its very thin, like a Zine. I&#39;ve never been much into poetry, never learnt any at school beyond shakespeare. I found the long paragraphs of poetry connecting, I cant describe his writing but I hope you can check it out both to understand my asks of recommendations (and because it&#39;s a pleasant read).</p> <p

## Fantasy Adventure Books for Adults?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big fan of the adventure fantasy genre and grew up on stuff like Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, Guardians of Ga&#39;Hoole, etc. It seems like this genre is mostly just for kids and teens, though. There&#39;s plenty of romantasy and contemporary fantasy for adults, but it&#39;s much more grounded in reality and usually focused more on romance. </p> <p>Are there any high-stakes adventure stories for adults? I&#39;m looking for intricate magic systems, chosen one destiny plots, enchanted weapons, magic princesses, stuff like that. Not a requirement, but even better if it&#39;s a full-fantasy story and not a contemporary one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Able_Examination4547"> /u/Able_Examination4547 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i1sxel/fantasy_adventure_books_for_adults/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksug

A unique concept - In Death Note, it‚Äôs the idea of writing names to kill with specific rules and limitations. I‚Äôm looking for something equally innovative and intriguing. 2. A morally twisted protagonist - I love how Light Yagami is essentially the villain, with a warped sense of justice and a fascinatingly dark mentality. 3. Intellectual battles - The intense challenge and mind games between two clever characters (like Light and L) is something I really enjoyed. </code></pre> <p>If you know of a book that combines these elements (or comes close) I‚Äôd love to hear your recommendations!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for any recommendations for stories where the MC has to grapple with being a monster -- or &quot;monster&quot; if it&#39;s more metaphorical. (I tagged this as horror but other genres are welcome!) As an example, I just finished Monstrilio by Gerardo S√°mano C√≥rdova and was absolutely floored. Another example is Marcus&#39;s storyline in Everything Under by Daisy Johnson.</p> <p>To be clear I&#39;m not looking for a &quot;inside the mind of a serial killer&quot; story. More like something that makes you think &quot;Hmm, is this a metaphor for being consumed by grief / living with OCD / being queer / masking to feel normal / feeling othered?&quot; etc.</p> <p>I hope that makes sense! Any recs at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Yikes_OMalley"> /u/Yikes_OMalley </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I‚Äôm looking for romance novels with a lot of smut that has two main characters who are both South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Nepalese, etc.) Recently I read Rebel Hard by Nalini Singh (part of her Hard Play series) which has a lot of mature content and the FMC and the MMC are both South Asian. I would love more recs like that. It is extremely hard to find a steamy romance novel with 2 South Asian characters. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/principessa071"> /u/principessa071 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i1lcbp/romance_novels_with_south_asian_characters/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i1lcbp/romance_novels_with_south_asian_characters/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i&#39;m even open to memoirs as I&#39;m trying to get more into them or maybe something similar to France Kafka, Virginia wolf, anne sexton; (more so memoirs in relation to addiction and mental illness)</p> <p>The books I have so far that I&#39;m going to check out at the library are: house of leaves and parable of the sower- maybe something similar to those but also I struggle with getting into books and finishing them so I&#39;m wondering if somebody can suggest something that is really easy to get into that will make me want to finish it all the way through. I would appreciate anything that isn&#39;t more than 7-800 pages but if it&#39;s a good book I will check it out!
