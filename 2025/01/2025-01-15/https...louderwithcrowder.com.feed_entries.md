I am opposed to having people hunted down, canceled, and fired over viral videos that happen to catch them at their worst. However, when it happens to someone who would most likely have you or I hunted down and fired if we were on the wrong end of such a video, I think we can agree to find the humor in it. That's where we are with the now-former DEI advisor (they/them), who should have chosen his words more carefully at a Philadelphia Eagles game.</p><p>If you haven't seen the video, a woman is cheering for the Packers at Sunday's NFL wild-card game in Philly. Behind her, an Eagles fan berates her for doing so and calls her a c*nt. This is no surprise, as the Eagles are known for having the scumbaggiest fanbase.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">What it's like going to
