<p>The whole world was watching when legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonnyevans_iphone-1-steve-jobs-macworld-keynote-in-activity-7283481868925059073-d9kY/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the iconic iPhone in 2007</a>.

Microsoft is adding more and more genAI features as time goes by and it’s increasingly hard to search the web without getting a genAI answer from Google and other search engines.</p>



<p>I’ve heard from people who love the technology, and I’ve heard from people who can’t stand it. Me, I’m right here in the middle: I keep experimenting with it, but articles
