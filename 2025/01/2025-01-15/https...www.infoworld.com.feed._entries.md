<p>My previous article <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3631092/intro-to-ktor-the-http-server-for-kotlin.html">introduced Ktor and some of its basic features</a> for building web applications. Now, we’ll expand the example application developed in that article by adding persistent data and HTMX, which will provide more interactive views. This gives us a setup with a lot of power in a relatively simple stack.</p>



<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3631092/intro-to-ktor-the-http-server-for-kotlin.html">previous article</a> for the example application code and setup. We’ll build on that example here.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on some big piles of mud over the years. You know, those sprawling applications made up of millions of lines of code, written by countless developers over the course of a decade or two, most of them long forgotten and utterly unknown to the current team. The application is the foundation of a business — the flagship application! — and has code you’d be ashamed to show anyone outside of the organization. Many of you are working on such an application today.</p>



<p>Where do these applications come from? Well, they come from a lot of different places and they’re created in a lot of different ways. Whatever the scenario, all of these tangled messes of inscrutable code have a few comm

<p>A book published in 1981, called <em>Nailing Jelly to a Tree</em>, describes software as “nebulous and difficult to get a firm grip on.” That was true in 1981, and it is no less true four decades later. Software, whether it is an application you bought or one that you built yourself, remains hard to deploy, hard to manage, and hard to run.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2253801/what-is-docker-the-spark-for-the-container-revolution.html">Docker containers</a>, and the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">OCI standard</a> for containers and their runtimes, provide a way to get a grip on software. You can use containers to package an application in such a way that its deploy

<p>The 2025 strategy document for Google’s Angular web development framework calls for enhancing the developer experience with capabilities such as zoneless change detection and signal-based forms, and making developer adoption of new features easier with schematics.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://medium.com/angular-blog/angular-2025-strategy-9ca333dfc334">blog post</a> on the Angular 2025 strategy was published January 13 by Minko Gechev, product and developer relations lead for Angular at Google. To enhance the developer experience, Gechev called out projects for 2025 such as promoting zoneless to developer preview and prototyping signal-based forms. Zoneless will enable Angular to have more effic
