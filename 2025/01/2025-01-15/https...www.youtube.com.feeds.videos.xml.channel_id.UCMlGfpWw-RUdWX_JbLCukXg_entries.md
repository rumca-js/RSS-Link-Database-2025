If they are really unlucky, they are have also faced a situation where the the wrong version of a library is loaded. However, a lot of us resort to suboptimal solutions just to get going, without fully addressing the root causes.

But getting the runtime linker/loader to locate the right libraries (and the right versions!) has a unique set of challenges that  should not be overlooked - after all, running the executables is critical for running tests, continuous integration, and obviously end-users running our apps and services. 

Managing dependencies continues to be one of the top frustrations of C++ developers as per the most recents ISO C++ Developer Surveys. When it comes t
