Tom Huizenga | January 15, 2025
There is no greater day each year at the Tiny Desk, for this music nerd, than when we host young musicians from the organization called From the Top. Through its 25 years of radio broadcasts, digital content and fellowships, FTT is a robust platform that showcases and supports young musicians around the country. And the three teenaged artists they‚Äôve gathered here will renew your faith in the future of music.

Thirteen-year-old Cameron Renshaw, from Byron Center, Mich., is a born entertainer. ‚ÄúI really pour my heart out whenever I play,‚Äù he told Ellen DeGeneres when he appeared on her program at age 9. He was so exuberant he probably could have hosted the show himself. For us he plays a tricky piece on a single string of his cello by the 19th century violin hotshot Nicol√≤ Paganini. The calm smiles on Renshaw‚Äôs face belie the difficulty of the music as he fingers wispy harmonics and leans into serious shredding.
