<p>I feel like I am safe in saying that we are not thriving on our changing planet – and we will not in the coming decades</p><p>My house in Altadena burned down in the wildfires on Wednesday. It all happened quickly. On Tuesday around 7pm, my wife and daughters went to a hotel as a precaution. I left the house with the dogs when the mandatory evacuation order came in around 3am. As best as I can put the timeline together, our home burned down around the same time that the sun came up, and I was able to drive in and see the damage around 2pm.</p><p>Neighbors that went in after said it looked like a “war zone”. I have never been in a war zone thankfully, but I didn’t think so. There was nothing violent or chaotic about it. No one stopped me from driving in. There were no sirens. I stood alone – no one else around – in front of my house that was at that point just a fireplace and chimney. The house across the street was about halfway done with burning down, and the house behind ours ha

<p>The former child star on Hollywood’s ridiculous expectations of women – at every age</p><p>From an early age, the model and&nbsp;actor Brooke Shields has been accustomed to seeing herself through the eyes of others. At 11, she played a teenage prostitute in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078111/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1">Louis Malle’s Pretty Baby, </a>at 14 a castaway discovering sex in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080453/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1">The Blue Lagoon</a>, and had her face licensed to&nbsp;doll manufacturers in the 1980s. When&nbsp;she was 15, Barbara Walters asked her about her measurements on&nbsp;national TV.</p><p>Shields had hoped that, by her late&nbsp;50s, those days of physical scrutiny would be behind her. Yet now she finds&nbsp;herself fending off judgment about her age.

<p>Noémie Merlant, Naomi Watts and Will Sharpe languish in a luxurious hotel in Audrey Diwan’s self-conscious remake of the classic French softcore drama</p><p>If anyone could have rebooted and revitalised the much-mocked 70s softcore-sexy franchise Emmanuelle, you would think it would be that formidably smart film-maker Audrey Diwan, winner of the Venice Golden Lion for her drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/happening-review-cleverly-structured-and-impeccably-produced-abortion-drama">Happening</a>.

<p>Nicole Kidman’s Babygirl, which features an erotic dairy-based scene, is the latest reminder of the debate about mature milk-drinkers</p><p>Several years ago, I tried to impress a new girlfriend (now my wife) with my cultural credentials by dragging her to an off-off-off-off-Broadway play about psychedelics in a tiny East Village theatre. I can’t remember much about the play – other than it was terrible – but I will never forget the young man sitting in front of us. He arrived late, awkwardly clambered over a few people to get to his seat, and then proceeded to down a carton of milk. The lateness and the clambering I could excuse. But the milk-drinking? That was horrifying. There is something undeniably unsettling about adults who drink cold cow’s milk in public.</p><p>I have tried to scrub the East Village milkman from my mind but I was reminded of the incident last week when Nicole Kidman <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/nicole-kidman-babygirl-toast-

But in the month leading up to that May 2020 upload, titled “an update on our family”, followers noticed that he had been phased out, old videos featuring Huxley had been removed and comments from followers inquiring as to his whereabouts promptly deleted while Myka continued posting homemaking videos.</p><p>After the Stauffers came clean, the backlash was (predictably) swift and unforgiving, calling out the family, which includes four other biological children, for exp

<p>Set in the same spot – from prehistory onwards – Zemeckis’s sentimental drama is an odd combination of cosmic ambition and domestic intimacy</p><p>Robert Zemeckis’s sentimental family heartwarmer, adapted by him and co-screenwriter Eric Roth from the graphic novel of the same name by Richard McGuire, is the movie equivalent of a book club choice; the star is a family home, the “here” of the title. Or rather: it’s the living room in a Philadelphia house where so much generational drama plays out.

<p>Whether it’s lurid, hip-hop-style tribute tees or monogrammed socks, making a personal mark on the things we wear can be a marvellous model for self-expression</p><p>It was Roger Federer’s white jacket in 2006 for me. Golden initials embroidered on the breast pocket, as he lifted the Wimbledon trophy. The elegant monogram suggested an aristocratic elan that I craved. Was it possible to grab some of his pedigree, without the achievements or money<strong>, </strong>but with some simple stitching? I wondered if I would feel like a fraud.</p><p>Twenty years later, such personalisation is attainable, and everywhere. Monograms and other distinctive touches, formerly the preserve of the rich, can be anyone’s. Zara, H&amp;M and Uniqlo offer embroidery options in-store. You can buy personalised phone cases, keyrings and socks through Etsy, Glenfiddich whisky bottles labelled with your name, and Converse Chuck Taylors with your face on them.

At the time, I was a freelance designer and illustrator, and spent my days working from my tiny red cottage in rural Connecticut.

<p>Ebike rentals are thought to have reduced car use – but caused consternation among some pedestrians and other road users. How can everyone get along?</p><p>I love Lime bikes because I live next to a secondary school, and I see those tearaways in every mood. Coming in, grumpy; going home, cranky; yelling at each other, kicking bins for no reason. Ah, the sweet hell of teenagehood. But when they get on the Limes, you can see in them both the playful, primary school kids of the past, and the adults, with agency and a place to be, of the future. Let’s not trouble ourselves over whether or not they’ve hacked them and that’s what the funny clacking noise is.</p><p>But the relationship overall, between the pedal cyclist, the ebiker and the pedestrian – well, it’s mixed. Some are happy to welcome rented ebikers as allies against the greater enemy (the car). Others say they have been actively put off cycling because of them. Pedestrians have other complaints still, and drivers – well, I le

 George’s home in Altadena was destroyed in what is now the city’s most destructive wildfire.
