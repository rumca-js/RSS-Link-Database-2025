I got into mtg a bit after the final fantasy crossover was announced and ordered my kit of stuff to play with for christmas (on dec 4th), my custom playmat from Inked Gaming included. As of now (jan 15th), my order is still unfulfilled and has been &quot;marked as a priority order by a staff member&quot; for over two weeks. Ever since the new year they have not responded to any of my support requests (about 5-6 messages) and my order has not had any updates since I have placed the order. Does anyone know if Inked Gaming is going through something right now that would cause them to ignore a customer who is well past his 2-3 week expected delivery date? Has anyone ordered from Inked Gaming since december and received their order? I dont want to cancel the order and probably wont, considering I need to contact someone in support to request a refund</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
