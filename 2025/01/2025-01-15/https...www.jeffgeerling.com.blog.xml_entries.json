It's efficient, available almost everywhere... but it's also a bit basic. It shows essential metrics, but looks like it's from the 80s. There are ways to brighten it up, like highlighting active processes or changing color schemes, but it's not the only game in town!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, there are a <em>lot</em> of modern monitoring tools\u2014and some not so modern, but immensely useful\u2014to choose from. This blog post will run through some of the ones I rely on most often. Let me know in the comments if you use any others I didn't cover!</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff G",
