The speedrunner, whose nickname is surprisingly descriptive--he has a doctorate in music composition--was attempting a live run of Elden Ring using a digital saxophone as a controller. Beating Elden Ring's toughest bosses via traditional methods is difficult enough, but Dr. Doot put that PhD to good use and quickly slayed the final boss, as well as the maddingly difficult optional boss Malenia.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">GameSpot had the chance to chat with Dr. Doot (who wished to only use his handle rather than his real name), and we were surprised to learn how the saxophone speedruns came to be. Rather than coming about simply as another way to beat Elden Ring or Dark Souls, they were an extension of Dr. Doot's practice on his digital instrument, the Roland Aerophone.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/let-him-solo-dr-doots-elden-ring-saxophone-run-was-agdqs-big-moment/1100-6528825",
