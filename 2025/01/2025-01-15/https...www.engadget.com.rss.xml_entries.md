<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-states-sue-deere-company-protect-farmers-unfair-corporate-tactics-high-repair-costs"><ins>filed a suit against John Deere</ins></a>, accusing it of “unfair” practices that force farmers to pay higher-than-average repair costs. The federal organization, along with attorneys general for Illinois and Minnesota, are alleging that the company engages in practices that keep farmers from being able to make repairs on equipment they own.</p>
<p>In other words, this is another salvo in the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="http://executive/"><ins>ongoing right-to-repair battle</ins></a>. The complaint states that John Deere engages in dubious practices, like incorporating software into farm equipment, to dissuade people from trying to fix stuff on their own. Additionally, the suit points to “decades” of unlawful behavior that pushes farmers to the company

The Nintendo Switch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-01-nintendo-switch-review.html">is over seven years old</a>, so it’s due for a refresh.

<p>Will it be a straight up sequel to the Switch with updated specs while retaining the same hybrid functionality or will Nintendo get weird with it? Will it even be called the Switch 2, or will the company go with something like the Super Sw

The streamer just dropped another trailer <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xALolZzhSM"><ins>that’s filled with new footage</ins></a>, much of it proving that the pseudo-sequel series will stay true to its violent roots.</p>
<p>The trailer’s anchored around Matt Murdock sitting at a diner with arch-nemesis Wilson Fisk, calling to mind that famous scene in <em>Heat</em> between Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. The relationship between these two was one of the main reasons that the Netflix series worked so well, and the actors still have plenty of chemistry.</p>

At CES 2025, NVIDIA made it plainly clear the technology was right around the corner. <em>PUBG</em> developer Krafton, for instance, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pubg-will-get-ai-powered-npcs-220218057.html">plans to use NVIDIA&#39;s ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) to power AI companions, which will assist and banter with you during matches.

<p>If you know anyone in the job market right now, then you’ve probably heard stories about just how tough it can be to even land an interview. Part of the problem, according to LinkedIn, is that too many people are applying for jobs they aren’t actually qualified for, which makes it harder for good candidates to stand out.</p>
<p>The company is hoping its new AI-powered “Job Match” feature can help address some of that disconnect. The feature, which is beginning to roll out today, uses AI to provide detailed summaries alongside job listings that let users know how qualified they actually are for a given role.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LinkedIn product manager Rohan Rajiv says that the AI-powered feature goes beyond the kind of simple keyword matching that job hunters may already rely on. Instead, it attempts to understand the breadth of your experience and how it aligns with the qualifications outlined in the job description.</p>

DJI&#39;s Fly app will display a warning about those areas but will no longer stop users from flying inside them, the company said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the article, DJI wrote that the &quot;in-app alerts will notify operators flying near FAA designated controlled airspace, placing control back in the hands of the drone operators, in line with regulatory principles of the operator bearing final responsibility.&quot; It added that technologies like Remote ID [introduced after DJI implemented geofencing]
