In my early teens i read a lot of fantasy, but also developed a taste for history and historical fiction. As i grew i kind of left fantasy behind, don\u00b4t even know why, maybe cause the fantasy i read was YA and felt no interest in them anymore or maybe it was more of a niche in the adult market so i didn\u00b4t find any fantasy book that appealed to me, maybe it was Tolkien\u00b4s prose and rythim that made me DNF the Fellowship of the Ring even if i loved the movies, and kept on reading historical fiction and detective/mistery/thriller books. </p> <p>Early 20s, i casually read a GRRM interview and he mentioned he loved Colleen McCulllough and her Master\u00b4s of Rome series, which is also my case.
