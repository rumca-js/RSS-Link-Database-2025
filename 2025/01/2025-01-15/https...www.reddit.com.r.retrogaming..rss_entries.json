This is, unfortunately, one of the downsides to owning a Commodore monitor: since it is not a TV, it only takes composite RCA and s-video RCA. That&#39;s it.

I&#39;ve got a huge itch to play them again and see how they hold up now that I&#39;m old enough to actually appreciate all the fine details. A huge part of what made them fun for me though was playing them with a joystick over mouse and keyboard, and if possible that&#39;s how I&#39;d want to play them again.</p> <p>I don&#39;t own a joystick currently though, so before dropping 50$ on a gaming peripheral, I wanted to see if anyone knowledgeable enough could tell me if it&#39;d actually work.</p> <p>So yeah, would the games be compatible with modern joysticks, and if not is there a mod or emulator I could use that would enable me to play them with one?</p> <p>Thanks for any assistance you guys can provide.</p> </",
