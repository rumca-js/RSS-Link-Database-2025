<p>Tory cheers were just a muted, half-arsed Pavlovian response as their leader failed to land a single punch on the PM</p><p>It’s becoming existential. First the Tory MPs began to wonder if there was any point to them being in Westminster. Sure, the title impresses some people and gets them one or two freebies, but those minor thrills soon start to pall as reality kicks in. Just drifting in the liminal spaces. Out of power. Out of control. And next to nothing to look forward to. They are less popular than Reform and in any case the next election is at least four years away. Days, weeks, months and years of nothingness lie ahead.</p><p>Now Conservatives are starting to have the same thoughts about Kemi Badenoch. At first they believed she was an exciting breath of fresh air. Someone ready to get stuck into any culture war.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/15/kemikaze-takes-aim-at-a-sitting-duck-pmqs-and-misses-with-all-six-shots">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sir David Spiegelhalter urges caution and humility when interpreting mortality data, inquiry told</p><p>The “unusual” spike in baby deaths on the neonatal unit where Lucy Letby worked had a 0.008% probability of occurring given its previous mortality rate, a public inquiry has been told.<br><br>
 Sir David Spiegelhalter, the emeritus professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, said the sudden rise in deaths in 2015 was “surprising” and enough to warrant an internal investigation.<br><br>
 However, he added that from a national perspective the increase was “not very surprising at all” and was “not extreme enough to be considered an outlier”.<br><br>
 The Thirlwall inquiry has heard that three babies died on the Countess of Chester’s neonatal unit in 2012, followed by two in 2013 and three in 2014.<br><br>
 This rose to eight in 2015 and there were a further five deaths in the first six months of 2016. Letby was removed from the neonatal unit in July 2016.<br><br>
