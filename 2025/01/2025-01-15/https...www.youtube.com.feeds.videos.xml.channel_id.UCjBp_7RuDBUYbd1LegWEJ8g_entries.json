        "description": "Sniper Elite: Resistance will launch on January 30th 2025, coming day one to Game Pass. The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC.\n\nIn a gripping new story that runs parallel with Sniper Elite 5, Harry Hawker, agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), takes the lead for the first time as he discovers an insidious new Wunderwaffe - something so powerful, it guarantees the Nazis will win the war.\n\nOffering unparalleled sniping mechanics, stealth and tactical third-person combat, Sniper Elite: Resistance turns the attention of the award-winning series towards a hidden war, far from the front lines, deep within the heart of occupied France.\n\nWorking with the French Resistance, this deadly addition to the Reich's arsenal must be eliminated.\n\nMultiple Kill List targets, and different infiltration and extraction points give you an unequalled choice with how to accomplish objectives and create your own play style.\n\nThe full campaign can also be experience",
