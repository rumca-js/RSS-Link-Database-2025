Aaron Draplin first used the name (typeset, of\ncourse, in all-caps Futura Bold) on a customized one-off <a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/field-notes-prod/images/FN1C.jpg\">red\nhardcover notebook</a> in 2002. Our \u201cofficial line\u201d sets\nthe birth of the company in mid-2007, when Coudal Partners and\nAaron first printed a batch of 3-Packs for the \u201cSwap Meat,\u201d\nfollowed shortly by the establishment of \u201cField Notes Brand\u201d as\nan actual thing.</p>\n\n<p>But a good case can be made that the very first Field Notes were\nmade in \u201cearly January 2005,\u201d making this, January 2025, an\nimportant 20th anniversary. This was the first \u201cbig\u201d run (200\nbooks, big for the time!), hand-printed by Aaron on his desktop\nGocco silkscreen rig.* This was the first use of a kraft-paper\ncover.
