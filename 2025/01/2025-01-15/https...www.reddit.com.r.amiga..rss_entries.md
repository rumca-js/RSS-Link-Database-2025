<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just repost here what i just wrote on the trustpilot review:</p> <p>*Order #6602 - 5th may 2024</p> <p>Contacted Steve with my A600 refurb build request and he was quick to reply to my emails(until i had paid for the whole order...) and accept the order. Paid a ¬£285.41p deposit on the 5th May 2024. I then was contacted to pay the remaining cost of ¬£579.48p on the 27th June 2024.</p> <p>From that point messages started to dry up and it would sometimes take a week or so to get a response, compared to the 1-2 days previously, before i had paid.</p> <p>Anyway the A600 finally showed up on the 12th September which is over 4 months after i paid the deposit, bearing in mind I was told the waiting time for the build was around 6 weeks when paying my deposit on the 5th May. Even though i had waited that long already, the PSU i was sent was not what i ordered(I ordered/paid for a modern CA-PSU but received an old original Amiga unit), but i was told t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This game had different characters you could turn into, and you walked around different rooms that were like 3d glass staircase type things. One of the characters was an orange wizard in a robe. You could shoot lightning to attack, it would fill up the screen. It had 2 player option I believe.</p> <p>I always thought it was called &quot;Wind Walker&quot; (i believe thats what my bootleg disk was labeled as), but that seems to only be a different game</p> <p>Thanks in advance, I know it&#39;s not much to go off of :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RealSirHandsome"> /u/RealSirHandsome </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i1sr6t/looking_for_a_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i1sr6t/looking_for_a_game/">[comments]</a></span>
