After some work, I finally figured out how to enable external filesystem access without sending Nextcloud into a conniption fit or having to have all my files owned by `www-data`. While that is at least a step in the right direction it doesn&#39;t change the fact that all the files still need to be owned by the same user, but at-least that user is part of the actual `users` group so I can share the files via SMB and with other apps without breaking thin

Create a virtual filesystem on my device and downloading files on demand (if not specified to keep them on the device all the time), uploading files in that folder if a connection to the server is possible and handle file collisions gracefully.<br/> Dos anybody know a good client for this usecase?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you are like me and you use a single directory for all docker containers in your home server and have a docker compose for each container with local folders mapped as volumes to those containers for persistent data like databases and config files, how do you manage the file permissions and ownership of the files created by the containers in those folders.</p> <p>There are many containers that will generate the persistent files as root, this creates an issue for me as I have default user <code>cron</code> backup script that runs <code>rclone</code> and I have had to change ownership of container volume files manually multiple time to have this script run correctly. Every other week my healthcheck says my cron is down due to some file permission issue for some file/folder or the other.</p> <p>Each time i add a new container to my stack, i have to do these shenanigans again. A good fallback that has worked for me was having the rclone script being ex

## Better tool for logs?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I usually check logs when something goes wrong. Most of the time, I will click on the logs icon for a docker container using the portainer ui. As I have built out my services, this seems more and more burdensome to do. I think what I need is a central location to look at all the logs I have, whether they are running as containers or otherwise.</p> <p>The amount of different tools for logs seems insane to me. Something like granfana seems more like a tool to visualize metrics than for being able to quickly go through logs (though I believe it can also do that). I guess I am mainly looking for a lightweight tool that can help quickly and easily access logs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ottovonbizmarkie"> /u/ottovonbizmarkie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i1n368/better_tool_for_logs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhost

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im terribly sorry this is a stupid question but I&#39;ve started out with my homelab journey with a bare metal linux install and docker containers running a media server, *arr stack, a dashboard, paperless-ngx, etc and now that i finally got something more powerful for my homelab upgrading from my raspberry pi I assumed a proxmox install would be my next step because that&#39;s what i see everywhere but i just don&#39;t understand the use case, why would you want to manage so many different vms? Why even use different vms, how are LXC containers better? Ive never seen an option to get them on the GitHub page of a project, why hoolahoop and map so many things to get your config files in one place when you can just map the config directory from a docker container</p> <p>I just don&#39;t understand the use case, if you use it please chime in and help me understand why you do over just a single debian or fedora server install and run everything in docker
