Spartacus: Blood and Sand debuted on STARZ in 2010 and was followed by a prequel series chapter Spar

Don't miss our Switch 2 launch title predictions! With the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 very clearly on the horizon, we’re starting to wonder what Nintendo Switch 2 games we’ll be playing on it come launch day. So, in the absence of an official day one lineup, why don’t we have a good ol’ guess at what the Switch 2 launch games could be? 

With Super Mario, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and even Halo rumoured to be on the way, we know it’s too much of a dream to think that all of these games will hit the Switch 2 on day one, but even if we get half of them we think we’re in for a great time when we pick up those new joy-con. Here’s what we think (or more accurately, hope) Nintendo has in store for us when the Switch 2 release date rolls around.

What are your Nintendo Switch 2 predictions for the new Nintendo console? Let us know in the comments!

As Severance Season 2 arrives on Apple TV+, the stars of the TV series are ready to talk about what to expect next from the world of Lumon Industries.

We interviewed stars Adam Scott (Mark Scout), Zach Cherry (Dylan George), Britt Lower (Helly Riggs/Helena) and Tramell Tillman (Seth Milchick), as well as creator/showrunner Dan Erickson about what's coming up in the new 10-episode season. That includes the increasing conflict between the "innies" and the "outies" -- a.k.a. the versions of their characters who live their entire lives at work within Lumon, and the versions who exist outside of work. Of course, the innies and the outies don't know anything about each other, other than that they exist, but that looks to be an increasingly dicey situation as the second season of Severance begins, especially considering where things ended with Season 1.

In this Severance interview, we discuss new characters like the very young Miss Huang, guest stars like Gwendoline Christie, and, of cour
