<p>These days, a mini PC can deliver fantastic performance at a fraction of the cost of a full-blown desktop PC or laptop. The Beelink SER5 Pro mini PC is a great example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Computer-Graphics-Support-Three-Screen/dp/B0CF1Y4Z8T/">now on sale for $271 on Amazon</a>, which is a cool 25 percent off its original $359 price tag.</p>



<p>This tiny computer features an AMD Ryzen 7 5850U processor, a model that’s been out for a few years at this point but can still handle light gaming and everyday work apps with no issue. There’s also 16GB of RAM on board, which you can later upgrade to 64GB as needed.</p>



<p>The Beelink SER5 Pro also comes with a 500GB SSD, which should be enough storage for most folks, including all your apps, photos, documents, and some videos. Still, if it’s not enough, you can always upgrade up to 2TB of

## Get $350 off this budget-friendly Acer RTX 4050 gaming laptop

<p>The Acer Nitro V is one of the most popular gaming laptops in the country, and it’s easy to see why. I call this particular model “Old Faithful” because it’s stuck around for a long time and frequently goes on sale — like today, when you can pick it up with a Ryzen 5 processor and an RTX 4050 graphics card <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-nitro-v-anv15-41-r2y3-gaming-laptop-15-6-full-hd-144hz-amd-ryzen-5-7535hs-geforce-rtx-4050-16gb-ddr5-512gb-ssd-obsidian-black/6576633.p?skuId=6576633">for just $600</a>. That’s $350 off its original price.</p>



<p>At this price, it doesn’t have the latest and greatest hardware. But a six-core AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS paired with 16GB of DDR5 RAM is pretty darn solid in anyone’s book. Ditto for the Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with 6GB of VRAM. It’s not going to play <em>Indiana Jones</em> in 4K with all the trimmings,

<p>One of the best headphones on the market right now is on sale with a cool 25 percent discount. I’m talking about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH/">Sony WH-1000XM5 that are now down to $328 on Amazon</a>, making this a great time to snag a pair for yourself if you need quality ANC cans.</p>



<p>These headphones look stylish and they’re comfortable to wear for long hours, thanks to its soft fit synthetic leather and lightweight design. It’s one of the main things buyers love about this model. The sound quality is top-notch, too, delivering clear and balanced sound with lots of bass.</p>



<p>But the thing that makes these headphones worthwhile is the superior active noise cancellation that blocks out all external noise so you can immerse yourself in your music, games, podcasts, or streaming

## Google couldn’t sell AI for Workspace, so it upped the price and bundled it

<p>The big tech giants are all-in on AI. Regular users and corporate customers…not so much. But Google isn’t letting a little thing like reality stop it from injecting its Gemini AI product into every nook and cranny of your life. Instead of charging $20 per user for Gemini in Workspace, Google is just including it from now on. With a price increase. Wonderful.</p>



<p>“We believe that AI is not just another tool; it’s a foundational shift in how work gets done,” says Google’s President of Cloud Applications <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/empowering-businesses-with-AI">in a blog post</a>. What a shock, the guy selling melons thinks everyone should be buying melons. “…By removing the need to pay for an add-on to access our latest generative AI capabilities, we’re simplifying our plans and pricing to bring the added value of

<p>It feels like there are a million variations of every graphics card on the market. There aren’t, but looking at the search results for “4070” on Amazon, you could be forgiven for thinking so.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, Asus has five different flavors of the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2569484/surprise-nvidias-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-cost-less-than-you-thought.html">Nvidia RTX 50-series cards</a> and showed them off at CES 2025. PCWorld’s Adam got his hands on all of them for your perusing pleasure. (For the sake of disclosure, Asus sponsored the video below. Sending a team of live reporters and videographers to Las Vegas is expensive.)</p>

<p>Yesterday, Microsoft posted on the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/nonprofittechies/free-upgrade-to-windows-11-for-a-limited-time-only/4275494">Tech Community blog</a>, once again urging Windows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11. The company has been nudging users in this direction for a while now, employing increasingly desperate tactics as statistics continue to show that <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/">Windows 11 adoption has plateaued worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>It’s been bad news for Microsoft, who previously announced that Windows 10 will officially be no longer supported on October 14, 2025. You can still keep using your Windows 10 PC after that date, but you’ll no longer receive security updates so you’ll be exposed to greater and greater risk over time.</p>

<p>Dell and HP are two of the biggest laptop brands for good reason. They both make plenty of great PCs, and whether you’re buying a laptop for school, work, gaming, everyday productivity, or all of the above, you’ll find lots of good machines from both brands.</p>



<p>Seriously, no brand is best in <em>all</em> situations! That’s what we’ve seen throughout our laptop reviews. The best brand <em>for you</em> depends on what you’re looking for, the type of laptop you’re buying, and the prices you can afford — and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2330162/buying-a-laptop-heres-why-you-need-to-shop-the-sales.html">the right laptop sale</a> could change the whole calculus.</p>



<p>You’ll find a mix of both Dell and HP laptops, plus laptops from many other manufacturers, on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/436674/the-best-pc-laptops-of-the-year.
