This is as it should be. Few ministers ever cut through widely. Even fewer resignations stand out \u2013 Geoffrey Howe, Robin Cook and Sajid Javid are among the exceptions, perhaps. Most ministers who resign, though, are simply washed away with the political tide.

What the realtors neglect to mention, however, is that, while crime rarely ascends the hills, flames certainly do. And that the very things that make this sun-soaked city\u2019s dream homes so attractive \u2013 lush landscaping, quaint timber construction, raised terrain and narrow, twisting lanes \u2013 are the very things that make them burn so well.
