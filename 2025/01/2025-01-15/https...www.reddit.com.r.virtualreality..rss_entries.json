I&#39;ve thought about either a psvr2 or a pimax crystal light but I&#39;m open to other suggestions, especially if they have wireless pc connectivity. I like the idea of eye tracking but I understand its not widely supported yet. The biggest difference definitely is in the resolution and fov between those headsets I listed. I have thought of getting full body amu tracking but is that worth it? I just don&#39;t know if I should go with a smaller upgrade and get that extra tracking, I have been playing vr since the og rift. My budget is about $1000, but that&#39;s not absolutely strict. Any suggestions or shared experiences would be a big help! </p> <p>Also my rig has a 6950xt, an i7 11700k and 16gb of ram </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
