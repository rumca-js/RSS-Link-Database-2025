The book centers around a group trying to preserve and study the Kaiju vs a group that wants to exploit them. Goes into the science of how they exist. </p> <p>2nd - Skeleton Coast by John Marsh: this would be a drama. The book takes place during WW2 and is a detailed record of a shipwreck of a civilian ship that unbeknownst to the passengers was also carrying military cargo. The multiple failed attempts to rescue them in one of the harshest climates on earth, the coast of Namibia.

I mean, yeah, I was very young back then and I think I would have enjoyed it even if it hadn&#39;t turned out to be the masterpiece that it ended up being. Plus, it was released just 2 days after my 13th birthday, so it felt like a gift. Anyway, I was excited to see it ever since the first trailer for it dropped.</p> <p>But I recently asked myself: How did people react back when the movie was first announced? I&#39;m not saying when the first trailer dropped, but when news outlets reported that a movie about LEGO is in production. </p> <p>My kid me would have thought it was excitement, but... thinking like an adult (or someone who is about to turn 24), I think the initial reaction might have been that the movie smelled like a cash grab. Or not like a cash grab, but more like something that, conceptually, doesn&#39;t sound like something that",

While nice, I much prefer a single continuous story in my trilogies, such as in the Lord of the Rings trilogy - a single story spanning 3 movies which was intended to be 3 movies from the start. </p> <p>One thing which intrigued me when searching for other such movies, was that all of them were adaptations of other properties like books.

As of this I found dead poets society to be on my list of must watch. I\u2019ve just now finished the film and was in love with it minutes in, this film shows a great perspective of young males never having to make their own decisions shown a small glimpse of freedom by a way of words. I\u2019ve seen many arguments on this movie saying that Mr.keiner was the cause of Neil\u2019s death and or highly influenced it. I\u2019d have to say from my point of view as a current high school student that Mr keiner is a person needed in all young men\u2019s lives. He gives hope and confidence to kids who have never had to make decisions for themselves and would never last in the world if they were to be put out in the real world as they are. I believe Mr keiner said all the right things and didn\u2019t make Neil become an actor but inform him on the importance of opportunity and doing what is loved but not expected. Keiner",
