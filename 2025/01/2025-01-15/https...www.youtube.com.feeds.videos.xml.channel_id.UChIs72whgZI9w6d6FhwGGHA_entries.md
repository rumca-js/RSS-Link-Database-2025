The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 will arrive soon. NVIDIA Thermal Engineer Malcolm Gutenburg joined us to show a number of RTX 5090 Founders Edition finished and prototype samples, including liquid metal, 3D vapor chambers with claimed world-first designs, and careful dual blow-through design of the finstack. This engineering deep-dive discussion gets into the details of thermal engineering for a 575W-capable cooler. While we haven't tested it yet, our review of the NVIDIA RTX 5090 will likely be in the works soon, and that'll include thermal benchmarking and testing. In the meantime, we'll go over the engineering details with Malcolm.
