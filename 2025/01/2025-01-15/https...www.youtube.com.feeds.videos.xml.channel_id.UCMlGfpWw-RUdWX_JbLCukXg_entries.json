If they are really unlucky, they are have also faced a situation where the the wrong version of a library is loaded. However, a lot of us resort to suboptimal solutions just to get going, without fully addressing the root causes.\n\nA lot of the time, we focus on the \u201cbuild\u201d process, that is, producing our binaries and executables. But getting the runtime linker/loader to locate the right libraries (and the right versions!) has a unique set of challenges that  should not be overlooked - after all, running the executables is critical for running tests, continuous integration, and obviously end-users running our apps and services. \n\nManaging dependencies continues to be one of the top frustrations of C++ developers as per the most recents ISO C++ Developer Surveys.
