<p>Arsenal could feel the heat. Back-to-back home losses in the domestic cups had seen to that. One has pushed them to the brink of elimination in the Carabao Cup, ahead of the semi-final second leg at Newcastle. The other on penalties against Manchester United in the FA Cup was terminal.</p><p>Mikel Arteta’s team could also sense opportunity. Liverpool’s draw at Nottingham Forest had seen to that. And so the equation was pretty clear. Manage the occasion against the team they most love to hate. And win to move to within four points of Liverpool at the top, albeit having played an extra game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/15/arsenal-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The second coming of David Moyes confirmed the new Everton manager is no miracle worker. But how they could do with one.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a glorious chance to level in the 93rd minute but blazed over from Jesper Lindstrøm’s inviting cross.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/15/everton-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A blind spot on standards has marked the new government’s early days – but it’s not too late for Labour to restore trust in politics</p><p>In theory, Tulip Siddiq’s resignation as a junior Treasury minister ought to be a political bump in the road for Keir Starmer, not a pothole crash. Siddiq is a moderately interesting politician, but not a major one. She is not a household name. She is therefore expendable. The government’s direction is unaffected by her departure.</p><p>Naturally it is a grim personal moment for Siddiq. But it is mostly a matter of indifference to the British public. This is as it should be. Few ministers ever cut through widely. Even fewer resignations stand out – Geoffrey Howe, Robin Cook and Sajid Javid are among the exceptions, perhaps. Most ministers who resign, though, are simply washed away with the political tide. This is likely to be Siddiq’s fate.</p><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/j

<p>A century of foolhardy development, including public subsidies for rebuilding in the firebelt, hugely contributed to this tragedy, writes our architecture critic. LA must rethink – and build upwards not outwards</p><p>‘Crime don’t climb” is one of the glib mottoes long used by Los Angeles real estate agents to help sell the multimillion dollar homes in the hills that surround the sprawling metropolis. Residents of the lush ridges and winding canyons can rest assured, in their elevated green perches – safely removed from the smog-laden, supposedly crime-ridden flatlands beneath. What the realtors neglect to mention, however, is that, while crime rarely ascends the hills, flames certainly do. And that the very things that make this sun-soaked city’s dream homes so attractive – lush landscaping, quaint timber construction, raised terrain and narrow, twisting lanes – are the very things that make them burn so well. They create blazing infernos that, as we have seen over the past week,

<p><strong>The Yard theatre, London<br></strong>Twentysomething twins, a rabbi, a Holocaust survivor and an East End thug embark on an ingenious heist movie parody that’s also a deft exploration of being Jewish today</p><p>It begins with the accidental murder of a neo-Nazi plumber in the home of a pair of Essex-born Jewish twins. Soon enough, it has turned into a full-on heist movie parody involving a motley group of Jewish vigilantes – a rabbi, a Holocaust survivor and an East End thug, alongside the reluctant twins.</p><p>Their plan is to kidnap former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, facing charges of antisemitism in his party.

<p>Just how did an ageing non-league journeyman defender end up captaining the club to four major trophies in three years?</p><p>Tony Book. Mr Manchester City. Skip. One of our greats. Yet few fans have specific memories of him playing. Not necessarily because we didn’t see him play, just because he went about it so quietly. He wasn’t known for dashing overlaps or canny underlaps; flair or vision; passing or dribbling. And he certainly wasn’t known for his goals, though he did score four – or was it five – in his 315 games. Booky was a solid, tough-tackling right-back with a fair bit of pace, despite looking as if he should be on standby for a Dad’s Army XI.</p><p>When we were kids, City fans wanted to be Franny Lee, “King” Colin Bell or Mike “Buzzer” Summerbee.

<p>With Tottenham next up at the Emirates, Arsenal manager must restore the positivity of the 2022-23 season</p><p>Mikel Arteta was sitting in the Emirates Stadium away dugout when he realised the scale of the task that awaited him. It was December 2019, and although he was still nominally the assistant manager of Manchester City, cruising to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">3-0 victory against Arsenal</a>, thoughts were naturally beginning to turn towards the project he had secretly decided to take on. And – to put it mildly – he was alarmed.</p><p>This wasn’t simply a case of how bad Arsenal were on the pitch. Performance is a fickle thing. There are known variables, measurable objectives. Performance you can fix. But the energy in the stadium, the disgruntlement, the disconnect between the players on the pitch and the fans in the stands: as Arteta contemplated his first job in management, this was the

<p>Lentils are cheap, nutritious and good for the planet. Here are three delicious ways to get more into your meals</p><p>My pantry is stocked with an abundance of lentils: tiny red ones that take moments to cook, which I throw into soups; buttery yellow ones for <em>khich</em><em>di</em>; French green ones to add heft to salads; glossy black beluga; and pebbly puy. They’re cheap, nutritional powerhouses that have a low carbon footprint, require little water to grow and improve the health of depleted soil, making them good for our planet, too.

Back in 1996 Bath’s Phil&nbsp;de&nbsp;Glanville had to lie down in the back of the taxi taking him to Twickenham so no one could identify the skipper poised to replace Will Carling before he was unveiled dramatically from behind a large curtain like a nervous contestant in Stars in Their Eyes.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025 and Maro Itoje, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/maro-itoje-replaces-jamie-george-england-captain-six-nations-rugby-union">the 136th man chosen to lead his country</a>, was not even present for his inauguration.

<p>A backlash is growing – some women are turning to apps or other methods, but a disturbing number seem to be giving up on birth control altogether</p><p>For many women I know, contraception is a kind of decades-long quest.

<p>A classy cast plays it straight in this enjoyably daft action epic about the crossbow sharpshooter forced to shoot an apple from his son’s head</p><p>Nick Hamm lets rip with some gonzo Game of Thrones craziness in his retelling of the William Tell myth with a blue-chip cast. Limbs get chopped off in a style I haven’t seen since the days of Monty Python’s Black Knight. It’s the story of the 14th-century Swiss folk hero and crossbow artist, a peaceful farmer and huntsman who has endured continual tyranny and humiliation at the hands of his Austrian Habsburg masters, and finally rises up against them on a coward-of-the-county basis; the flashpoint being made to shoot an apple from his son’s head for the sneering amusement of the Habsburg nobleman Gessler.</p><p>It’s adapted by Hamm from the 1804 play by Schiller (not many action movies can boast that), but gives Tell a Muslim wife and adopted son that Schiller didn’t imagine; a flashback reveals this to be the result of Tell’s experi
