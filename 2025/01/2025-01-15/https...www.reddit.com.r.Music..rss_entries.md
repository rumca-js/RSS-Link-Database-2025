<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (by some miracle) have discovered this awesome artist called Char! I&#39;m sure this name will be familiar to the cool people on here, but his music is so groovy and filled with absolutely epic guitar solos. Shinin&#39; you, Shinin&#39; Day has to be one of the funkiest songs ever. It would be criminal for me to not share his tunes on here. Dude&#39;s been releasing music since 1976 and is somehow still absolutely awesome.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I have loved music all my life and recently even started to produce some myself.</p> <p>But since three days I’ve been listening to one and one song only, that I can’t get enough of. Sure I had songs that I was listening to 10 times a day, but this feels different…</p> <p>Whatever I’m doing, this song plays in my mind, it speaks to me on a very fundamental level I can’t really describe and it makes me feel like I’m addicted to it. Whenever I hear it I’m in my own world. I don’t even care if somebody hears me when I sing along with it. The song I’m talking about is “Glycerin - Bush”.</p> <p>Does anybody else have this strong feelings towards this song or any song for that matter? Is this still healthy and did you ever had similar experiences?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fabolous_gen2"> /u/fabolous_gen2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i28ook/feeling
