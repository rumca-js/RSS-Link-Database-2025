        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So as title says I would like to know whats linux compatibility at moment, I always used windows and I&#39;m honestly tired of it specialy after having to move out of windows 7 to 10, back then I heard linux had a lot of issues with games but was starting to get better with Vulkan or something like that so I just decided to wait a while longer.<br/> Currently been mostly playing Delta Force and checked a website called PhotonDB and it said the game was borked, so if I swap to Linux am I not gonna be able to play Delta Force? What about new game releases? do I have to wait a long time for compatibility like console exclusives &quot;windows version&quot;?<br/> Are all the compatibility struggles worth swaping to linux at the moment or should I wait a while longer until SteamOS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JuicyLyn\"> /u/JuicyLyn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/com",

I\u2019ve already tried deleting all my save files and reinstalling the game. After doing that, it worked temporarily up until I reached the ruins, where it crashed again.

This is mostly related to CP77, other games aren&#39;t that demanding so i can&#39;t tell, or don&#39;t have those issues.</p> <p>I did update Arch in that time, i think there were some mesa and kernel updates in the meantime, but seriously, 90 to 50 FPS is a huge difference.
