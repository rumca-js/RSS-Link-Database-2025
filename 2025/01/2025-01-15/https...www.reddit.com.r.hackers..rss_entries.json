I had access for a while up until the summer of 2020, where I discontinued my use of it and made another account. I haven&#39;t been able to access it since then, I can&#39;t find the email, and I can&#39;t figure out the password, and whatever phone number that was connected to it is no longer in use. The account is consistently opening my messages, saw that one was opened a month ago, and on another account, a message was opened 10 months ago. I do have an idea of who could be hacking it. </p> <p>I&#39;m mainly pissed because there were a lot of memories in there that were from a crucial part of my life, and also a lot of NSFW photos of myself (from when I was a teen, no less) that I would have liked to delete. </p> <p>Any advice or recommendations that I could possibly follow? Even if it means getting the account deleted alt",
