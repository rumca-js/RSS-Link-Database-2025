<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m new to this and I want to do it right. I learned how to get kali Linux on my Chromebook. Ive been teaching myself how to use nmap, wireshark, and maltego. Is there a good tutorial on how to use maltego better. The YouTube videos I’ve found are outdated and can be vague InTheir steps. Any information on the subject would help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SadShower3531"> /u/SadShower3531 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1i28xot/help_learning_osint/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1i28xot/help_learning_osint/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been learning HTML, CSS, Python etc as a full stack web development in learning the complete structure of a website. Right now I’m an electrician and looking to change careers. In your professional opinion is it better to take a deep dive in web development then learning the penetration side of things or is there a more recommended way to learn? FYI doing this completely free no boot camps just whatever free information I can get. </p> <p>I have been using the Mimo system, W3 schools, forms, Reddit I have been attempting hackthissite.com but not exactly sure I know what I’m doing yet so I have been watching videos and tutorials on methods. Just wanting to see if I’m on the right track?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Evening-Party-5004"> /u/Evening-Party-5004 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1i1yap8/beginner_questions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <
