<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not asking anyone to help me hack into this for clarification. I made this snapchat back in 2019, stopped use in early 2020. I had access for a while up until the summer of 2020, where I discontinued my use of it and made another account. I haven&#39;t been able to access it since then, I can&#39;t find the email, and I can&#39;t figure out the password, and whatever phone number that was connected to it is no longer in use. The account is consistently opening my messages, saw that one was opened a month ago, and on another account, a message was opened 10 months ago. I do have an idea of who could be hacking it. </p> <p>I&#39;m mainly pissed because there were a lot of memories in there that were from a crucial part of my life, and also a lot of NSFW photos of myself (from when I was a teen, no less) that I would have liked to delete. </p> <p>Any advice or recommendations that I could possibly follow? Even if it means getting the account deleted alt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Its looking like one of the laptops i use for just regular stuff has been hacked, pretty sure its the old realtek audio vulnerability, seems it has elevated privledges, i cant remove no files, cant do nothing, using task manager, checking all processes, some questionable ips showing up also when i check with netstat in cmd, looks like the DLL is replaced with malcious library, likely with full permissionsâ€¦ had a look over the old CVE files for the old vulnerabilty reports so now wondering is this a new vulnerbility or just an old one repurposed </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Anonymouseeee888"> /u/Anonymouseeee888 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i1modf/realtek_audio_rtkaudioservice64exe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i1modf/realtek_audio_rtkaudioservice64exe/">[comments]</a></span>
