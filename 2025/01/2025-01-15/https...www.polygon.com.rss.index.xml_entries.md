The words kick off a three-minute monologue in which she recaps the previous film&#8217;s events and anticipates some of the twists and turns of the sequel, all the while playing an increasingly loud drum solo. Eventually, she&#8217;s interrupted by her bandmate Mary Jane. &#8220;Yo, Deaf Leppard,&#8221; Mary Jane says, as a nod to the classic rock band.</p>
