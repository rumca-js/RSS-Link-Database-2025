I only downloaded about 5-7 plugins, and one of them was certainly a Trojan. While no one logged into my Steam account directly, it was still accessed by someone in Ukraine, who wrote dozens of spam messages to all my Steam friends. This all happened after I downloaded a VST called Modo Bass.</p> <p>Another important note: not only was my Steam account remotely accessed, but also my Reddit, email, and eBay accounts. Someone even attempted to purchase a gift card, which would have gone through if I had my bank account connected to eBay.</p> <p>I had to fully wipe my laptop multiple times to stop people from remotely accessing it, all of this happened after I downloaded Modo Bass from G-Meh by the way.</p> <p><strong>Another important note:</strong> I obviously don’t have any substantial evidence to prove that G-Meh is a malicious and unsafe website.

Apparently I have made too many requests and now Im not able to download anymore unless I change my ip address to a different location. It works for a bit until it doesn’t then I have to switch locations again. Anybody know of any other work around to simplify the process and not having to keep changing ip addresses ? Or if anybody can point to another good source that would be appreciated </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Full-Effect"> /u/Full-Effect </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i
