<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m 24 and I’ve been terrified of telling my brother that I’m gay. He’s older than me, he’s married in a heterosexual relationship, with 2 children. I’ve always felt pressure to follow in his footsteps, but I’ve known for a long time that I was into men. He’s asked about relationships in the past and I’ve always brushed it off and said that I’m not seeing anyone.</p> <p>Last night I’d had 2 glasses of wine and I was sat watching tv with him. I hadn’t planned to do this (probably the effects of red wine) but I randomly said “I’m going out with a guy now, and it’s going really well.”</p> <p>Initially he smiled and looked confused, he then asked “as in, a relationship?” and I confirmed.</p> <p>What he said next I would never have expected. He’s a real “lad” and I didn’t think he would care or be supportive, I thought he’d either laugh, or shrug it off.</p> <p>He said “You are my brother no matter what, and I can see you are now your true self”.</p> <p>S

Along with some beneign tips (like posting pics of pets &amp; learning some Mandarin), one tip I&#39;m seeing a lot is to not bring up &quot;any of that LGBT stuff.&quot;</p> <p>Part of why this bugs me so much is that there <em>are</em> queer Chinese Rednote/小红书 content creators, and from what experience I do have as an American who&#39;s studied Chinese &amp; lived in China it&#39;s a mixed bag as far as acceptance of queer folks goes -- not monolithically intolerant of queerness like many of these videos are indicating

During one interview for a bussing job, the lady giving the interview was very condescending and rude. Didn’t get that job. At another I worked at ihop as a server and heard a manger I think talk crap about me. Then I worked at a subway and one of the girls had it out for me. Left that job because I felt uncomfortable. I wasn’t even out but I feel like a lot of people could tell. My self-esteem took a pounding there.

Why do assholes keep denying us basic human rights just bc we don’t feel attraction or experience gender the same way as them? I’ve just been so angry and confused and moody and being a teen who grew up thinking things were getting better and having the whole world look like it turned on us feels… suffocating. Idk.
