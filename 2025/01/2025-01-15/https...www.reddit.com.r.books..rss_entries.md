<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I first noticed this about a year ago when I had been driving on a particularly long road trip at night. Now I&#39;m noticing it with reading. I&#39;m not tired or drowsy. My eyes just seem to cross (not sure if they&#39;re actually crossing) but everything becomes unfocused after a few seconds and it&#39;s almost like I&#39;m about to fall asleep. It feels like the way we used to purposely do this as kids so that we could see the pictures in those Magic Eye books, except that I&#39;m not doing it on purpose. Do you guys have this issue? If so, how do you manage it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ectoplasm777"> /u/ectoplasm777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i2akt9/i_keep_having_issues_with_the_eyes_becoming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i2akt9/i_keep_having_issues_with_the_eyes_becoming/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The World we live in Chapter 1 : Banker’s Divide</p> <p>A poor man walks into a bank. He’s not looking for opportunities, not seeking the future—he’s looking for a handout. “I need money,” he says, with desperation in his eyes. “I need money to feed my kids, to keep my home, to pay off debts. I need money just to stay afloat.” The bank hears the plea but sees the limitation. The poor man is a liability, not a partner. His request is often met with skepticism or bureaucracy. They offer him a loan, often with high interest, to keep him in the cycle of debt. There’s no vision here, just survival.</p> <p>The poor view the bank as a place to receive, a place to fulfill immediate needs, to keep the wheels of daily life turning. The transaction is personal. It’s about relief, but it’s rarely about growth. When they leave, they carry the weight of that debt on their shoulders, with no plan on how to escape the cycle.</p> <p>In contrast, a rich man walks into

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wanted to write my thoughts about writing in Night Film novel. The book is categorized under Mystery &amp; Thriller genre but more than that I really loved the writing in the book. The book has nothing new to offer in terms of &quot;mystery&quot;. The plot is pretty straight forward from start to end. But the writing is so good.</p> <p>Right now there are lot of novels marketed as domestic thrillers with such mediocre writing. It&#39;s always &quot;He said, she said, this happened, that happened&quot;. There&#39;s no interesting turn of phrase or anything. Or maybe domestic thrillers don&#39;t warrant such prose. But the writing in this book is so atmospheric.</p> <p>The books follows 3 characters trying to find - What happened to Ashley Cordova (Is it really a suicide??), daughter of Stanislas Cordova, who is a fringe director/ enigma himself. We get bits of Cordova&#39;s family history being told by different people involved in various capacit

Also intelligent. Both make the newspaper for their heroics. Both are modest and downplay their good deed(s). Both have lost their mothers and really randomly lose their virginity to an older women who they&#39;ve rescued in some way. </p> <p>If I&#39;d read the books a few months after each other, I don&#39;t think I would have noticed the similarities but I couldn&#39;t escape them. </p> <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve come across this even when reading formulaic books one after another.

Does it change the way you view their work? </p> <p>I will admit it affects me very little, if at all. I consider authors as separate entities from their work. HP books were a cornerstone of my childhood, and how JKR is now behaving doesn&#39;t impact that at all. The same with Gaiman&#39;s body of work. I loved his books and what he did or didn&#39;t do is irrelevant for that. I do see a possible &quot;conflict of interest&quot; in buying a new book from a disgraced or suspicious author. Is it an approval of his actions and/or lifestyle? I don&#39;t know. Would I read something new from Gaiman? Probably yes if it piqued my interest (just like I would decide before this happened).

I don&#39;t think he is a good person in some aspects, but I can understand why he is the way he is, and it is all written very well - I will address this later. </p> <p>Now to discuss Mercedes&#39; fate, it&#39;s important to establish that I believe this book IS a moral story. There is a 3rd party (Dumas&#39;) view present in it with an opinion about the characters and things that are happening. The story, while complex and thought provoking, also has an established inner logic where the writer in a way hands out judgment to his characters - the good gets rewarded, the bad punished.
