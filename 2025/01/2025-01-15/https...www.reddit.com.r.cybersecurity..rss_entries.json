It was sent to a single-use email address that I set up for CISM. It smelt like phishing.</p> <p>Lots of other people on social media commented that they got the same.</p> <p>Then <a href=\"https://x.com/ISACANews/status/1879644591558680761\">ISACA&#39;s twitter account replied</a> to a few other people to say there&#39;s no breach and that the email was just a mistake. Presumably the crappy 3rd-party URL is an early step in some site migration, testing, or whatever? But ISACA haven&#39;t replied to me directly.</p> <p>Well, in this timezone it&#39;s time for me to go to bed, maybe in the morning all this will make sense, maybe ISACA will explained what happened, maybe not. Did any of you clever people get it? Are there better answers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Useless_or_inept\"> /u/Useless_or_i",
