        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A new attack has been discovered that uses multicast poisoning to perform pre-authenticated Kerberos relay attacks over HTTP, which could put even hardened Active Directory (AD) environments at risk. This method takes advantage of weaknesses in local name resolution protocols like LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and uses tools such as Responder and krbrelayx to hijack Kerberos authentication traffic. Here\u2019s how it works: when a victim client can\u2019t resolve a hostname, the attacker sends a poisoned LLMNR response, redirecting traffic to their machine. The attacker then captures the victim\u2019s authentication request, relays it using krbrelayx, and impersonates the victim to access high-value services, like Certificate Authorities or management endpoints. What\u2019s scary about this attack is that it can be done without any prior authentication, which makes it easier for attackers to pull off, especially in environments where NTLM relaying is bloc",

Pretty cool.</p> <p>But how do they fit 2FA? Ideally they&#39;d fit the &quot;something you have&quot; factor, but they&#39;re in no way associated with your device. Maybe if your phone generated a private certificate and used it to generate the code, but they don&#39;t, it&#39;s just a shared secret. And isn&#39;t this made worse by the ability to migrate them between devices, since you only need a different account login, which would just be 2x &quot;something you know&quot; factors, which isn&#39;t true 2FA, right?</p> <p>As opposed to a true 2FA token, with a certificate and everything, which if you lose the token you truly lose access to everything prot",
