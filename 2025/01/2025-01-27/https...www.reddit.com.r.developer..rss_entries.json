Although, I cannot find anything about this online. </p> <p>The closest thing I can find is mention of the core functionality of the app being within the app itself, without reliance on external data. </p> <p>We were originally planning to pull out help and support articles from HelpScout via their API. </p> <p>Is anyone able to shed some light on why one of our developers believes this an absolute no go? </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheJohnSphere\"> /u/TheJohnSphere </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ib87xh/api_populated_content_for_help_support/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ib87xh/api_populated_content_f",

I can code for days, nights dive into complex problems always get solutions for complex logic or math processes etc l never failed that, its my strength.</p> <p>However sometimes I&#39;ve got a writers block delaying myself for committing and testing. I keep starting keep delaying and keep wondering if it will be all okay. I wait until my brain feels sharp again often a few hours later hit go fix if need and it&#39;s done. I somehow well my brain won&#39;t compute my brain kinda freezes. I like coding for work and hobby my mind drifts away to a land of logic. But I refuse coding without the sharp feeling.</p> <p>I don&#39;t want to endup stressed either this brake kinda protects me as well but sometimes it&#39;s not handy to have. My productivity isn&#39;t at risk I&#39;m a solo dev working on my own. I just wonder do others recognise this?</p> <p>A freeze, a worry, afraid to execute, taking a few hours not",
