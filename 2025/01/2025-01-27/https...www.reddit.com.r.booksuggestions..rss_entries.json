I&#39;m due to start a new book in a day or two and it&#39;s either going to be MISTBORN or CITY OF BRASS. Which one should it be? Now, I&#39;ve got both trilogies so they&#39;ll be read, but need to start with one as I&#39;m a reader who can only do 1 book at a time. Also, I tend to read series one after another so I&#39;ll be all 3 books in for whichever series is chosen. Let me know which one you&#39;d go with! For a vibe check, my last 3 reads were: Piranesi (4<em>), The fragile threads of Power (5</em>), and now finishing Kaikeyi (will end up being 5*).

While informative, most of these books make me feel gloomy and I want a fiction book that I can escape into and that provides a source of hope. I am someone who reads 4+ books at a time, so this would be read in tandom to whatever nonfiction I&#39;m reading (currently reading invisible women - unrelated but I wanted to give it a shoutout!) I like fantasy, political thrillers, and historical fiction, but I&#39;m open to anything. Romance is fine but I prefer it as a subgenre to something with an actual plot. </p> <p>Also I&#39;ve put a lot of effort into diversifying the author pool I read from, so books written by non-white authors are appreciated! I specifically won&#39;t read anything by Colleen Hoover, Rebecca Yarros, or Sarah J Maas. </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

It was told in a first person basis from the founders perspective, not told by others.</p> <p>I was looking for the name of this book, if possible. </p> <p>If not, are there any recommendations of something similar? I&#39;m looking specifically for something with unusual ideas but not motivational/self-help type stuff. If it&#39;s a biography of a designer or agency creation, please recommend it!</p> <p>A book I&#39;ve read and enjoyed a lot is Draplin Design Co by James Draplin.

I just read I am pilgrim which I really enjoyed, I also just read the shining which I absolutely loved the world Stephen king created. I was hoping for some book suggestions that are somewhat sci-fi thriller or horror? I\u2019ll be honest I\u2019m not a big fan of fighting and action in books as I find it hard to keep track. Hoping to find a must read book/s that fit this genre. Also love spy books or any book that just has your mind wondering and imagining things.

So I&#39;ve been reading the Red Rising series lately and I&#39;ve realized that I really like sci-fi with super elaborate world-building (like high fantasy!).

Another book I liked was The Poppy War because of its high-fantasy feel and insane worldbuilding. </p> <p>Some things I&#39;m looking for:</p> <p>- I&#39;m okay with YA, but preferably adult</p> <p>- High-fantasy is fine too, as long there are technological elements/magic and good worldbuilding</p> <p>- anything that has war, politics, and the military</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sad_mushroom_child\"> /u/sad_mushroom_child </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ib0kou/epicstyle_scifi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ib0k",
