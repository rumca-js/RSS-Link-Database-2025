Water supply line replacement tips…I turned the water off to the house and drained the system. Normally I set a 10 minute timer on my G-SHOCK (GA110WD in this tutorial) and cut out the old pipe. While the timer was going I rebuilt the copper line with Viega press fittings. Then the last step was to press the new line on the old copper.
