<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing Try Hack Me modules for quite a while, and while I do think I&#39;m still far from being professional, I do have enough of a grasp on the fundamentals to where I can figure things out (even if I don&#39;t exactly know how). I&#39;m just curious, as someone who&#39;s being self-taught in this, when should I start job-hunting? I don&#39;t want to go in with no clue what I&#39;m doing, but at the same time, I don&#39;t want to trap myself in the learning phase while having the ability to hack into the pentagon.</p> <p>If I were in school, I would just wait until I graduate, but like I said earlier, I&#39;m self-taught, so I have no idea when that would be. My initial guess is that I should be good when I&#39;m able to do moderately difficult modules on my own, and potentially make a write up. However, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s too far or too short of when I should. </p> <p>For others who were self-taught, and got a career in cyb

So if anyone could help I would be very grateful as so far turnout is very slim - .onion links are fine aswell but they should be accessible without payment - thanks in advance :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/__Henrik__"> /u/__Henrik__ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibioy1/searching_for_leaked_credentials/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibioy1/searching_for_leaked_credentials/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Having no experience in hacking, I discovered there&#39;s a group of dudes in my area taking advantage of spyware and indirect hacking to get laid and improve their socials. Found out cause they were taking credit for my work, and knowledge pretending to know Me and use information they got from me to prove it. Being in the Philippines it&#39;s a pretty hard concept for people to believe to be true. As I type this they probably are watching Me and preparing how to counter whatever I do.</p> <p>What can I do? what would you recommend is best for this situation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sttraightnotstraight"> /u/Sttraightnotstraight </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibalwb/how_to_deal_with_local_hacking_group/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibalwb/how_to_deal_with_local_hacking_group/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello there, i&#39;m founding our SMBs SOC and i&#39;d like to do a small inside penetration test to show my colleagues where our systems are vulnerable.</p> <p>The problem i face is that I have no clue on where to find active exploits, and it seems it&#39;s illegal to publish them (?), as I&#39;m usually quite successful in finding virtually everything on the web.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also looked into Metasploit but their exploits are 15 years old? Am I overlooking something?</p> <p>The CVEs that our internal systems might be vulnerable to don&#39;t have any proof of concepts online (that i can find) so naturally i tried finding similar ones: also no luck.</p> <p>From the CVEs description only I can&#39;t build a PoC with my current experience.</p> <p>Any advice or pointers?</p> <p>Thank you in advance for any help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Daniel0210"> /u/Daniel0210 </a> <br/> <span><a href="
