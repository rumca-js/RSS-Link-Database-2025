It\u2019s one of those books that has a legendary status in the &quot;Library of Science&quot;, and now I understand why. But while it captivated me in many ways, I also found some parts where it didn\u2019t age as well or felt lacking. The intent of this post is not to paint a bad image of the book in any way. As a physics student, I think this book is a benchmark in scientific literature and I encourage all of you to read it, if you&#39;re interested.</p> <p>Here are my thoughts:</p> <p>The Strong Points</p> <ol> <li><p>Awe-Inspiring Perspective Sagan\u2019s ability to convey the vastness and beauty of the universe is unmatched. He doesn\u2019t just present facts; he invites you to feel the wonder of it all.

Not just as a preference, but rather this notion that character arcs and stories as a whole are in fact in fact synonymous and cannot exist without the other.</p> <p>At first it was more a minor annoyance but the sheer amount of material that preaches this view is in my opinion, kinda a problem?

In particular, it talks about how during their first meeting he made her cry due to a misunderstanding and, since the news had become public, his publisher sets him up with her on a fake date to make everyone believe that they were dating. After this, they actually start dating, although it doesn&#39;t last long. By the way, the misunderstanding where he made her cry happened because she got the lead role in a movie based on his book and he didn&#39;t agree on having her in that role. </p> <p>In the third book (The Alaska Sanders Affair) the fact that Mar",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was thinking about the recent romantasy boom and was wondering what works prior to 2000 could be seen as romantasy or proto-romantasy. </p> <p>The notion of romance in fantasy is not new--just look at the Tale of Beren and Luthien, or the romance between Aragorn and Arwen. That&#39;s just looking at the birthplace of what we call modern fantasy, but tons of fairy tales deal with romance. Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid most easily come to mind, but hundreds and hundreds of fairy tales deal with princes and princesses and frogs and duchesses and peasants falling in love.</p> <p>Regardless, romance in fantasy, I feel, hasn&#39;t had as large or as mainstream a following until the recent booktok romantasy craze. Sure, there&#39;s romance in some fantasy works--The Witcher, Earthsea, ASOIAF, Wheel of Time, The Black Company, Malazan--of varying levels of quality and intensity. But what works prior to the year 2000 combine romance and fantas",
