A fresh start. The new broom sweeps clean. The folk sayings are in agreement. Sure, your favorite old programming language is comfortable and easy to use.

What was once perfect has gone a bit stale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new language is just the thing, and it seems dozens of great new ones launch every year.
