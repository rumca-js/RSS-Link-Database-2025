<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Other than aireplay, I like bettercap a lot better and I think we can all agree on that. Is a little bit more difficult to use but is a more robust tool with other type of attacks that aircrack lacks. Anyways, bettercap can only deauth if your NIC can be set up to &#39;Tx Power 30&#39;. I already used iw dev to change it on managed mode, and monitor mode. None of it works, that&#39;s why I ask what type of NIC can be set up to 30dBm at least. Staying ethical and legal, this is on my home network.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YoWhoDidThat"> /u/YoWhoDidThat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ibkqdv/i_have_a_question_guys_what_type_of_nic_can_be/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ibkqdv/i_have_a_question_guys_what_type_of_nic_can_be/">[comments]</a></span>
