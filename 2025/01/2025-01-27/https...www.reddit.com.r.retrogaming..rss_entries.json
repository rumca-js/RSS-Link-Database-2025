Looking back at all the amazing games we grew up with, I often wonder: what\u2019s the one retro game you wish you had as a kid but didn\u2019t?<br/> For me, it\u2019s <em>Chrono Trigger</em> on the SNES. I had no idea how incredible it was at the time, and I only discovered it much later! What about you? Was there a game that slipped through the cracks, or one that was just too expensive back in the day? Let\u2019s share our nostalgia stories!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/overeducatedlady\"> /u/overeducatedlady </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1iavkl2/whats_the_one_retro_game_you_wish_you_had_as_a_kid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1iavkl2/whats_the_one_retro_game_you_wish_you_had_as_a_kid/\">[comments]</a></span>",
