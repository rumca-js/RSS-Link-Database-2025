I have tried multiple ways of automating the time sync in windows, but being the broken mess that windows is, not a single thing i have tried worked so far.</p> <p>So, since im tired of syncing manually, i only have 2 options left: Set my Linux to Localtime or set Windows to UTC. I have read multiple warning on both options about breaking stuff, so I want to ask you guys if any games or important apps you use actually did break in order for me to decide which one has to abide by the rules of the others.
