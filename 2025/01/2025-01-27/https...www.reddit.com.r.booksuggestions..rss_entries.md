Which one should it be? Now, I&#39;ve got both trilogies so they&#39;ll be read, but need to start with one as I&#39;m a reader who can only do 1 book at a time. Also, I tend to read series one after another so I&#39;ll be all 3 books in for whichever series is chosen. Let me know which one you&#39;d go with! For a vibe check, my last 3 reads were: Piranesi (4<em>), The fragile threads of Power (5</em>), and now finishing Kaikeyi (will end up being 5*).

## Book about two designers and how they started their agency

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Once I read a book about two designers/marketers and how they started their agency. The book seemed relatively modern (as if it was written on a post 2010 era) but I stopped reading it after about 30 pages because I lost my tablet. It was told in a first person basis from the founders perspective, not told by others.</p> <p>I was looking for the name of this book, if possible. </p> <p>If not, are there any recommendations of something similar? I&#39;m looking specifically for something with unusual ideas but not motivational/self-help type stuff. If it&#39;s a biography of a designer or agency creation, please recommend it!</p> <p>A book I&#39;ve read and enjoyed a lot is Draplin Design Co by James Draplin. He has a lot of specific, fun stories and is ideally the type of book I&#39;ve been looking for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/luismonteiropinto"> /u/luismonteiropinto </a> <br/> <span><a hr

I’m looking for either a 100% set in reality book or one that is placed in a fantastical world (INTENTIONALLY). It’s not a book but Neon Genesis is a great example of something I’m looking for. It’s based in a fantasy world so things that would normally be outlandish in a world based in reality, seem regular. </p> <p>Also a lot of them tend to be monotone in its approach.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I (23M) have only really picked up reading as a hobby in the last 18 months after actively despising it for the previous 20 years.</p> <p>Since then I have read a number of books, all of which are exclusively ‘classics’; russian, American, English, French etc. However, I am quite a slow reader and currently only have the attention span to read for 15-60 minutes at a time.</p> <p>I’ve been reading about modernist literature theory and decided that the next book I read will be 100 years of solitude. But im wondering what you guys think would be good to read after that. I’m looking for some recommendations of modernist literature to ease me into the style as I hope to one day enjoy novels like Ulysses and Infinite Jest etc (I’ve only read a few small excerpts and they seem quite challenging—not equating them together in any way however).</p> <p>Any and all fiction suggestions welcome including short stories or epic sagas.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! So I&#39;ve been reading the Red Rising series lately and I&#39;ve realized that I really like sci-fi with super elaborate world-building (like high fantasy!). I&#39;ve also enjoyed some YA sci-fi with that feel similar, such as the Aurora Rising series and the Illuminae Files. Another book I liked was The Poppy War because of its high-fantasy feel and insane worldbuilding. </p> <p>Some things I&#39;m looking for:</p> <p>- I&#39;m okay with YA, but preferably adult</p> <p>- High-fantasy is fine too, as long there are technological elements/magic and good worldbuilding</p> <p>- anything that has war, politics, and the military</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sad_mushroom_child"> /u/sad_mushroom_child </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ib0kou/epicstyle_scifi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ib0k
