It&#39;s not that they aren&#39;t written well, it&#39;s just that I personally don&#39;t enjoy them, at least the really hard magic systems. For instance, I love the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, but the detailed magic system I just find boring. It was part of the reason I didn&#39;t like the Navani chapters in Rythm of War. (Don&#39;t want to get into spoilers.) Maybe this is just me, but I enjoy magic I just don&#39;t enjoy magic systems that are more scientific for a lack of a better word.

But also I recently read Where the Dark Stands Still by A.B. Poranek, which is very much along the same lines. And I think A.G. Slatter&#39;s books have a similar feeling, even though they might be more Irish than Eastern European. (To be honest I&#39;ve only read one book by Slatter so far.)</p> <p>Are there more books or authors that fit this trend (if it is a trend)?
