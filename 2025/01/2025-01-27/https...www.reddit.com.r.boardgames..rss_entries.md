This fall I am planning a long through hike (~2000 miles) where every ounce of weight counts. My hiking partner and I love to play each other, and I would like to take some sort of game with us. I am thinking of making a 19x19 grid on one of my storage bags to play several different games (go, shogi, pente, chess) and I am trying to brainstorm what to use for pieces. Ideally it would be something that could be used for a secondary purpose and be as light as possible, and 2 colors. We could just use pebbles we find, but the 2 colors problem remains there.

Googling gives me too many generic lists (we love Ticket to Ride but I can’t open another site with that as the big recommendation 😂), and I find BGG difficult to use for finding casual games.

It looks pretty cool, but I am a bite confused about the playtime of a single session. I understand the game is split up into days, so would you play one single day per session? Is that where the wide range in playtime on BGG (60-240 minutes) comes from, that you could play multiple days per session?</p> <p>How long do you think the sessions are on average, when you play only one day? That is rather important for us, as we would like to play about 90 minutes or less per session. We are four players, so we might be on the longer side here.</p> <p>Also: The other game we are looking into is The Kings Dilemma.

But she does play on occasion to entertain me.</p> <p>It&#39;s tough finding a game that she actually enjoys but one of the main factors that I&#39;ve found is that she enjoys games where there is a lack of penalties. For example, she likes Quack of Quedlinburg, there is a penalty where you have to choose &quot;money&quot; or &quot;VP&quot; if you go bust but you&#39;re still gaining not losing anything. Another example, Rajas of the Ganges, no real penalty other than spending a bit more to do an action or waiting for the next round plus there are a lot of bonuses for achieving certain amounts of points.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done a fair amount of research and having a hard time finding this specific criteria.
