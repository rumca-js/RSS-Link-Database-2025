In these transphobic and homophobic countries, the simple act of being yourself can lead to severe consequences, ranging from social rejection to legal persecution. People face daily threats of imprisonment or even the death penalty (though only some countries punished LGBTQ+ individuals with death penalty and it&#39;s rare) simply for expressing their true identity. The lack of legal recognition\u2014such as the inability to marry someone of the same-sex or access gender-affirming care and surgeries\u2014further deepens the suffering of people living in such tough environment. These countries and the people living in them endure UNIMAGINABLE suffering, pain and hardships, and yet their struggles often go unnoticed in global discussions about human rights and equality.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I grew up in the most conservative household ever where when I first got exposed to the community without realising that it exists my parents were like &quot;Don&#39;t you dare EVER kiss a girl&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t wish to be a boy&quot;, &quot;Those people aren&#39;t ok&quot; etc. I was only 9 I didn&#39;t know what they were talking about! Plus I alredy from back then I had signs I may not be a cishet. I remember back in 2021 I found out my ex-online friend Identified as non-binary and I didn&#39;t know that term so I asked my grandma about it from curiousity and she was like &quot;EWWWW DISGUSTING&quot; and I used to be phobic of enbys thanks to her also homophobic and transphobic. I even watched some Daily Wire channels forcing myself to agree with them. Thanks to them when I started feeling like a dude and started to have a lot of dreams where I make out with girls I couldn&#39;t accept it. I felt like I was born to be a cishet nothing more",
