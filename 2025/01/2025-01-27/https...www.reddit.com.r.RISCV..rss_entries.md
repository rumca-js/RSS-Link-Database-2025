<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! Looking for some good RISCV processors/boards that can run Linux and commonly used apps. They must also have a fully open-source firmware, just for security purposes. If possible, would be great for the price not to be something too high, so &lt; 200. Let me know if you have any recommendations! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketExpensive5740"> /u/CricketExpensive5740 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iawr88/any_good_riscv_processors_or_boards_with_fully/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iawr88/any_good_riscv_processors_or_boards_with_fully/">[comments]</a></span>
