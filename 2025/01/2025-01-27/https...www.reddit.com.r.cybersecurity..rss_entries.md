<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been in the cybersecurity field for a long time, and while I’ve seen a lot of things change, some lessons remain timeless. One thing I wish I truly understood when I started was this: not every problem requires a technical solution.</p> <p>In the beginning, I was all about the tools like firewalls, SIEMs, IDS/IPS, you name it. But over time, I realized the biggest vulnerabilities often weren’t technical at all. They were human. It’s amazing how a well-crafted phishing email can bypass even the best security stack.</p> <p>I’ve learned that building relationships across departments and teaching others about security has a bigger impact than spinning up another tool. Don’t get me wrong, tools are critical, but if the people using them don’t understand why they matter, it’s like buying the fanciest lock for a door no one bothers to close.</p> <p>For those newer in the industry (or even seasoned pros), what’s the one piece of advice you’d give?

## New Attack Abusing Multicast Poisoning for PreAuthenticated Kerberos Relay

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A new attack has been discovered that uses multicast poisoning to perform pre-authenticated Kerberos relay attacks over HTTP, which could put even hardened Active Directory (AD) environments at risk. This method takes advantage of weaknesses in local name resolution protocols like LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) and uses tools such as Responder and krbrelayx to hijack Kerberos authentication traffic. Here’s how it works: when a victim client can’t resolve a hostname, the attacker sends a poisoned LLMNR response, redirecting traffic to their machine. The attacker then captures the victim’s authentication request, relays it using krbrelayx, and impersonates the victim to access high-value services, like Certificate Authorities or management endpoints. What’s scary about this attack is that it can be done without any prior authentication, which makes it easier for attackers to pull off, especially in environments where NTLM relaying is bloc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been setting up an EPM for my org that supports TOTP codes, and this question crossed my mind. Okay, so TOTP is mostly used as a 2FA solution, and delivering them over SMS or email is known to be insecure, so we have these apps to make it so they&#39;re not transferred over the internet. Pretty cool.</p> <p>But how do they fit 2FA? Ideally they&#39;d fit the &quot;something you have&quot; factor, but they&#39;re in no way associated with your device. Maybe if your phone generated a private certificate and used it to generate the code, but they don&#39;t, it&#39;s just a shared secret. And isn&#39;t this made worse by the ability to migrate them between devices, since you only need a different account login, which would just be 2x &quot;something you know&quot; factors, which isn&#39;t true 2FA, right?</p> <p>As opposed to a true 2FA token, with a certificate and everything, which if you lose the token you truly lose access to everything prot
