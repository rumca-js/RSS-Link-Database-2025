Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.\n\n\"Sniper Elite: Resistance is a modest retread for the Sniper Elite series, rather than an exaggerated goose step forward. A near total lack of innovation makes Resistance seem like little more than a Sniper Elite 5 remix, rehashing everything from the skill tree to the traps and enemy types, and serving up some sniping sandboxes that are for the most part a bit too similar to locations that have featured in the series\u2019 prior entries. Its bonus propaganda missions are fun but fleeting, and its X-ray kill-cam still blasts balls and brains to bits but no longer blows my mind. Those only just getting on board with the series will undoubtedly find a bit more to like, but I\u2019d argue that on balance, Sniper Elite 5\u2019s superior story sandboxes and otherwise similar feature set makes it a much better buy even three years on from its release. Sniper Elite: Resistance is a solid stealth-based shoo",

        "description": "Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC. Also available on Xbox.\nOrcs Must Die! Deathtrap's roguelite spin on the action-tower defense series works pretty well. Even if most of its traps and endless parade of highly killable enemies are carried over from past games, the new Warmages' abilities and the combined impact of its randomized modifiers can really shake things up nicely for quite a few runs. Puzzling out how to steer the orcs to their doom and then taking part in the bloody carnage is as much fun here as it is in the rest of the series. I did lose steam due to the slow meta progression and the increasingly long series of missions where the first ones are too easy and the latter ones got frustrating because of bullet-sponge enemies, but that was only after a few dozen hours of happily chewing up orcs and spitting them out both solo and in co-op.\n\n#OrcsMustDieDeathtrap #Gaming #IGN",
