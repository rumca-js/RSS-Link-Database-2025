<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Downloaded some iffy cracks stupidly yesterday and just an hour or so got a PayPal confirmation text from the same number they usually come from. Freaked out and immediately changed all my passwords ever and deleted lots of random accounts. Could this just be the timing, and somebody sold just my PayPal login? I feel like if it was malware everything would have gotten scraped and I would be getting all sorts of password reset / 2fa emails.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Heya!</p> <p>I recently started to enjoy Stremio + Torrentio + RD for my own needs. Thing is: My sister doesn&#39;t do English as well as me, and has been a sub to the German services Joyn and RTL+ for some years by now for her entertainment. As of today, they also upped their prices ridiculously, and try to bully her into these new sub models. Hard no.</p> <p>I tried to find her usually watched shows on my setup, but wasn&#39;t able to find anything. (Mostly domestic cooking shows, stuff done by Joko and Klaas, and basically anything that runs on the mentioned channels.)</p> <p>What could I try to enable her to take advantage of this setup as well? (A paid and secure VPN service would be available as well if needed.)</p> <p>Many thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Medium9"> /u/Medium9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ibk6hj/german_broadcast_conte

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, so I entered in a university and I feel that I need a very complete AI chatbot to help me study. I already tried a lot of them in high school but a lot of them have paywalls and a maximum of prompts you can use per day. Also, the free version of chatbots are pretty limited.</p> <p>I want to know if I can get a AIchatbot on Android that can search, write and show images about things that I ask without a maximum number of prompts per day and that i dont have to pay.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BeyHow"> /u/BeyHow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ib85ar/android_artificial_inteligence_chatbots/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ib85ar/android_artificial_inteligence_chatbots/">[comments]</a></span>

## GOG Games broken on Firefox

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pretty much what the title says. I went to the site yesterday and it just showed a white page, so I thought they were down or something. I checked it again today and it&#39;s still the same with Firefox, regardless of Ublock being on or off (the web console says something about a syntax error with a missing curly bracket, not sure if that&#39;s related). I then checked with Edge and the site loads fine, so it seems to be a browser issue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NAron6"> /u/NAron6 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ib4vty/gog_games_broken_on_firefox/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ib4vty/gog_games_broken_on_firefox/">[comments]</a></span>
