Is the DeepSeek story too good to be true? And should businesses in the US and allied countries allow employees to use an app when the company’s Chinese background and operation are so opaque?</p>

<p>The legal heat on OpenAI in India intensified as digital news outlets owned by billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani joined an ongoing lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator. They were joined by some of the largest news publishers in India including the Indian Express, and Hindustan Times, and members of the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), which includes major players like Zee News, India Today, and The Hindu.</p>



<p>These publishers claim OpenAI scraped and adapted their copyrighted content without permission, hurting the media industry’s revenue and intellectual property, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-face-indian-digital-news-firms-ambani-adani-copyright
