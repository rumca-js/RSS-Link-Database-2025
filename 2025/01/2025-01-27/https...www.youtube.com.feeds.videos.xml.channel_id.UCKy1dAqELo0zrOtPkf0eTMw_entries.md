## Eternal Strands Review

Eternal Strands reviewed by Mitchell Saltzman on PC. Also available on PlayStation and Xbox. 
When Eternal Strands is good, it’s very good, thanks to exciting boss fights that iterate upon Shadow of Colossus’s gigantic encounters better than just about any of the other games that have used it as inspiration. Those gigantic fights are sandwiched between a forgettable story, some frustrating weather mechanics, and underwhelming combat against normal enemies, but none of those flaws are dealbreakers when you consider how great the high points area.

## Assassin’s Creed Shadows Is Not the Ninja Splinter Cell Game I Hoped For

Assassin's Creed Shadows emphasizes stealth with a lighting system reminiscent of Splinter Cell. This aims to advance the stealth mechanics of the long-running Assassin's Creed game series. However, after a three-hour Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay demo build, the improvements feel minimal, and we're not fully convinced that AC Shadows is offering a meaningful change for Assassin's Creed. Find out what we think of Assassin's Creed Shadows stealth so far in this video.

## Sniper Elite: Resistance Review

Sniper Elite: Resistance reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PC. Also available on PlayStation and Xbox.

"Sniper Elite: Resistance is a modest retread for the Sniper Elite series, rather than an exaggerated goose step forward. A near total lack of innovation makes Resistance seem like little more than a Sniper Elite 5 remix, rehashing everything from the skill tree to the traps and enemy types, and serving up some sniping sandboxes that are for the most part a bit too similar to locations that have featured in the series’ prior entries. Its bonus propaganda missions are fun but fleeting, and its X-ray kill-cam still blasts balls and brains to bits but no longer blows my mind. Those only just getting on board with the series will undoubtedly find a bit more to like, but I’d argue that on balance, Sniper Elite 5’s superior story sandboxes and otherwise similar feature set makes it a much better buy even three years on from its release. Sniper Elite: Resistance is a solid stealth-based shoo

## Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap Review

Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap reviewed by Dan Stapleton on PC. Also available on Xbox.
Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap's roguelite spin on the action-tower defense series works pretty well. Even if most of its traps and endless parade of highly killable enemies are carried over from past games, the new Warmages' abilities and the combined impact of its randomized modifiers can really shake things up nicely for quite a few runs. Puzzling out how to steer the orcs to their doom and then taking part in the bloody carnage is as much fun here as it is in the rest of the series. I did lose steam due to the slow meta progression and the increasingly long series of missions where the first ones are too easy and the latter ones got frustrating because of bullet-sponge enemies, but that was only after a few dozen hours of happily chewing up orcs and spitting them out both solo and in co-op.
