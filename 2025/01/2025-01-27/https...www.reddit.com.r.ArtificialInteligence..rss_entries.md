<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I often engage in conversations with Copilot and Gemini as I enjoy the humanlike responses and finding A.I. in general to be pretty incredible works of technology. During a conversation today, Copilot on it&#39;s own brought up my location after I asked the question &quot;What should I do on my day off?&quot; When I asked it how it knew my location, it first lied, and when I brought up the incorrectness of the response, it explained that I was correct but continuously attempted to steer me away from the topic. Once by literally saying &quot;Allow me to steer us...&quot; which I found funny. When I persisted, it gave me a solid no, stating that it simply could not discuss this. I&#39;m posting genuinely and solely out of curiosity. From what I have read online, Copilot should only be able to access your location with permission and for specific tasks. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Did I just activate Skynet accidentally?</p> <p>I&#39;v

DeepSeek uses GRPO, a pure-RL framework that skips the critic and calculates group averages of LLM outputs using predefined rules.</p> <p>3/ Since there’s no labeled data, the framework optimizes for rules like coherence, completeness, and fluency. For example, in mathematical tasks, the model gets rewarded for logically co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Many professionals are buzzing about the new DeepSeek model, claiming it could be an &quot;OpenAI killer,&quot; and the hype surrounding it seems justified. Recently, DeepSeek launched the DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models in various versions. These models deliver performance comparable to OpenAI&#39;s o1 on benchmarks like MMLU, Math-500, Codeforces, and more.</p> <p>In this short tutorial, we will explore the DeepSeek-R1 model and walk through how to run its Distill version locally using Ollama, Docker, and Open WebUI. This means you will be able to use a reasoning model with a user interface similar to ChatGPT—completely free and without needing an internet connection.</p> <p>Link: <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/using-deepseek-r1-locally">https://www.kdnuggets.com/using-deepseek-r1-locally</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kingabzpro"> /u/kingabzpro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:

DeepSeek’s low-cost R1 model, which is now the top app on Apple’s iPhone download charts, is “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs,” according to renowned tech investor Marc Andreessen. Here is an explainer on why DeepSeek is freaking out the AI world.</p> <p>What Is China’s DeepSeek and Why Is It Freaking Out the AI World?</p> <p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that’s just over a year old, has stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley after demonstrating breakthrough artificial-intelligence models that offer comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost.</p> <p>DeepSeek’s emergence may offer a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop.</p> <

The immensity of its knowledge and the speed with which it wields it displays a power unimagined except perhaps by those who believed that such a power could exist, that is, those who believed in god. Ironically, those who believed in such a power set up rules to deal with something that they imagined had such super-abilities. Whether there were 613 rules or 10 commandments or some other system, the people who created the rules imagined that they were trying to strike a bargain with a higher power. And for those who did not believe in such a power, it was an absurdity. But now there is that power. That power that can seemingly outthink man in many regards. And the question is now the same: What rules should be imposed to deal with such a power.</p> <p>Many may think that the threat is light. But, war causes both the worst and best case scenarios o

I sometimes use it to have philosophical discussions as well but sometimes censorship becomes a problem when the topic gets too sensitive, so I was also wondering if Deepseek is any better in that department?</p> <p>People seem torn on Deepseek so if someone could give me both pros and cons of using it, I would appreciate it.</p> <p>(Also, Plus subscription gives me access to DALL-E and Sora, I don&#39;t use them much but they&#39;re really cool tools to have at your disposal I suppose.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Repulsive-S
