Since the initial release, Iâ€™ve added a <strong>game-changing new feature</strong>:</p> <p>ðŸŽ‰ <strong>Dynamic Board Creation</strong><br/> You can now create unlimited boards simply by appending a subdirectory to the URL.

Some claim you can do it using Ollama with a few GB of ram.</p> <p>You can&#39;t run THE Deepseek R1 with Ollama. If you install Ollama and select Deepseek R1, what you are getting and using are the much much smaller and much much less performant distilled models. They are effectively fine tunes of different existing models (Qwen2.5, Llama, etc.) using data generated using Deepseek R1. They are great, but not THE R1 OpenAI is scared of.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know why Ollama decides to call these models Deepseek R1, but it&#39;s problematic.

But for everything to work as we want it we need to spread the resources of our GPUs over multiple VMs. </p> <p>As far as I know if you set up a VM you van assign a GPU to it and the VM uses this GPU exclusively and no other VM can access the same one. But there are ways to change this.</p> <p>I have heard of NVIDIA vGPU which basically creates virtual GPUs so the VM thinks it has access to one real GPU but the vGPU can dynamically access as much resources as the VM currently needs. Is it possible with NVIDIA vGPU to dynamically spread the VRAM and the power of all available GPUs over all currently running VMs so that the ones who need the most computing power get more then the oter ones? And if yes, is this the only way? Are there any alternatives? How would you solve this problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub

I also have them uploaded to a photo site which was able to ingest them in that same format. So I have a few questions about Immich. </p> <p>1) Can Immich do the same thing, where it will pull up ingest the pictures from that file share and arrange them in the exact same folder structure?</p> <p>2) When it ingests the pictures, will it leave the originals as is? The reason I ask this is because I recently setup paperless ngx, and I didn&#39;t realize that it destroys the original document when it ingests it, and I had to restore from backup. </p> <p>3) Is there any way to have Immich use that same fileshare as it&#39;s storage location? What I mean is, can it pull in that pictures folder, and then use that same folder to serve the pictures again, or does it have to put the pictures/videos all into its own databa

I chose to use UFW over iptables.</p> <p>I went ahead and set up local network SSH on a non-standard port, and was satisfied to see that SSH connections didnt work until I explicitly added <code>ufw allow [port]</code>. The firewall must be working, right?</p> <p>Then I began playing around with some Docker services. Until I can understand its impact on containers, I installed Docker as root for simplicity. However, I was surprised to see that I could access my running Docker containers on my local home network even though I didnt allow those ports in UFW. For example, the Docker container&#39;s internal port could be 12345 and mapped to the host port 54321 and I would then be able to connect to the service using 54321 on another host.</p> <p>I know that Docker containers use their own network, but the connection is
