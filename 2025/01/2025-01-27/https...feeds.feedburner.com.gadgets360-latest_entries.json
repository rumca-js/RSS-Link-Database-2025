Gene-editing experiments demonstrated a genetic link between fish gills and mammalian ears, with findings suggesting this transformation dates back millions of years. Researchers tested genetic enhancers in zebrafish, mice, and lizards, uncovering evidence that mammalian ear cartilage migrated from gills. The study also revealed links to marine invertebrates like horseshoe crabs, indicating deeper evolutionary roots for human outer ears.",

This discovery, based on a specimen from the South Australian Museum, challenges previous assumptions about its evolutionary origins. Marsupial moles, known for their backward-facing pouch and specialized digging limbs, exhibit unique adaptations for life underground, including a raised button-like nose and absence of external ears. These creatures do not form permanent tunnels and instead live in loose, sandy soils.",

The discovery highlights predator-prey dynamics from 76 million years ago, where ancient crocodilians preyed on or scavenged young pterosaurs. This specimen, identified through micro-CT scans, provides rare evidence of interactions between these species during the Cretaceous Period. Found in Dinosaur Provincial Park, this is the first North American record of crocodilian feeding on Azhdarchid pterosaurs.",
