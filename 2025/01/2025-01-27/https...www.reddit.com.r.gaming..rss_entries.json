More or less waited some time for it to go down a little bit, since the whole negative vibe around it and ... it&#39;s pretty good? I mean, solidly good. It&#39;s fun, driving the speeder is cool, the stealth mechanic is absolutely fine, combat is definitely serviceable, it&#39;s not hyper polished but not half bad either, even side activities like sabacc and the random arcade games are cool. End of the day I really can&#39;t get - why all the hate? I understand there have been lots of patches and fixes, maybe it was much more problematic at launch but it&#39;s a perfectly fine game to spend your time gaming. I heard somebody complain that Kay is not charismatic enough but I think that&#39;s a really nice diversion from the norm to me. For once I&#39;m glad to play a character who doesn&#39;t take themselves too seriously, and Nyx is absolutely adorable; maybe fatigue will kick in - aft",
