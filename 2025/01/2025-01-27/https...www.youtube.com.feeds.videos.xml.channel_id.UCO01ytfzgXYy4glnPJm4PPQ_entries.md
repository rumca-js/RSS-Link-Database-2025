Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Donald Trump shows what it's like when the United States actually acts like the most powerful nation in the world. With a couple of posts on social media, he forced an entire country to submit. Also, JD Vance does the cable news rounds and it doesnâ€™t go well for the news anchors. Trump is accused of cruelty when he pulls security off of Fauci, John Bolton, and other ex-bureaucrats. But why should taxpayers fund their security, anyway? New York City considers a new law that seems specifically designed to annoy me personally. And federal government workers are now living in fear under the Trump administration. This is supposed to be a bad thing, according to the media.
