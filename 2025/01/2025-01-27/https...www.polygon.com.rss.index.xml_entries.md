<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> kicked off 2025 last week with the reveal of <em>Aetherdrift</em>, the first big set of cards releasing this year. Fans who were worried about a lack of classic Wizards of the Coast storytelling were pleased to find it’s loaded with new lore — and dozens of excellent new cards, with lavish art. Today, Polygon can reveal two additional new cards dropping on Feb. 14, Spikeshell Harrier and Daring Mechanic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re back with another list of new game releases this week, and it’s a whole buffet: You can nibble on a little psychological horror, scoop up a heaping spoonful of sci-fi existentialism, or gorge on an open-world action game finally making its way to PC. Whether you want games that swallow your free time or games to jump in and out of, we’ve got you covered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, you can dive into <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em> as it finally swings onto PC, or hack and slash for loot in <em>Wayfinder</em> on Xbox. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> arrives later in the week, and it’s described as a “M

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">There’s an old saying that goes: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” However, few people know that this is usually followed by another adage: “But if it’s already stale, don’t keep reheating it with an air fryer.” Both statements are true for <em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>, the latest installment in Rebellion’s third-person stealth and tactical shooter saga set during World War II.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em>’s mechanics remain rooted in the past. While the action may have been enjoyable a decade ago, it’s certainly become more formulaic nowadays, made worse by a threadbare narrative, an unengaging romp across the

It’s making its debut during Max Monday on Jan. 27 from 6-7 p.m. and will be available until Feb. 3 when Dynamax Moltres will debut.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Dynamax Zapdos isn’t as hard as the very tough Gigantamax battles we’ve seen in the past, it can be tricky as there’s not many Dynamax Pokémon to use to counter it.</p>
