<p>Microsoft plans to soon remove its <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-themes-94880287-6046-1d35-6d2f-35dee759701e">official web page </a>for Windows themes and desktop wallpapers. The company has not given an exact date for when this will happen. The site, which Microsoft says is outdated, has previously offered visitors downloadable theme packs for both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>



<p>Instead, Microsoft is encouraging its users to download new themes and desktop wallpapers directly from the Microsoft Store.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-replaces-free-wallpaper-website-with-an-unorganized-mess-in-the-microsoft-store">Windows Central</a><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openais-for-profit-evolution-hits-a-major-roadblock"> </a>points out that a

<p>Dell makes some of the most popular OLED gaming monitors around under its Alienware brand, due in no small part to them being relatively low-priced. And while I wouldn’t call today’s deal “affordable,” it’s almost half off the $1,200 retail price. Right now, you can get a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-32-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3225qf/apd/210-blmq/">32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor for just $765</a> with the sale and a coupon code.</p>



<p>The AW3225QF is the flagship of Alienware’s current monitor line, with an impressive 3840×2160 resolution and 240Hz of refresh on its gently curved panel. Even the beefiest gaming PC will struggle to hit that at high settings on a modern AAA game, so if you need to smooth things out, it does have Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync compatibility.

<p>Nvidia is making great strides with its newest generation of graphics cards. With the Blackwell series (i.e., <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2573243/do-nvidias-geforce-rtx-50-series-specs-live-up-to-the-hype.html">the exciting new RTX 50 series</a>), Nvidia is focusing on powerful GPUs that rely ever more on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2562973/ai-upscaling-killed-native-graphics-gaming-for-the-better.html">AI features and AI-driven improvements</a>.</p>



<p>If you own an older Nvidia graphics card, though, things are getting tight. According to the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html">release notes for CUDA 12.8</a> — Nvidia’s programming interface that allows its GPUs to be used for general purposes — several GPU models are now considered “feature-complete” and will be “frozen” in an upcomin

<p>New AMD graphics cards are on the way, arriving sometime <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2583773/amd-says-radeon-9070-gpus-coming-in-march.html">in the next couple of months</a>, and they’ll be packing an upgrade to the company’s FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling tech.</p>



<p>But what if you’re still running a relatively recent Radeon card? Well, according to some new but unverified info, any game that supports FSR 3.1 should also work with FSR 4.0.</p>



<p>The info comes from “Kepler_L2,” a Twitter leaker with a strong history of accurate info on AMD. <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-fsr4-support-may-be-added-to-all-fsr3-1-games">VideoCardz.com reports</a> that despite AMD’s paucity of information shared on the upgraded, machine learning-enabled system, the new settings will be enabled by DLL file that “should” be compatible with

<p>Charging your devices doesn’t have to take forever, at least if you have one of these Anker wall plugs. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Pixelbook-ThinkPad/dp/B09Q52CXX1/">Down to $40 from its $75 MSRP on Amazon</a>, this three-port Anker USB-C power adapter is a great solution for keeping your phone, laptop, and something else fully juiced.</p>



<p>This wall plug uses GaN II technology, which means it’s not only more efficient at charging your devices than typical power bricks, but also much smaller in size. It also has improved heat dissipation, so it won’t get unbearably hot and accidentally burn your hand.</p>



<p>You’ll find three ports on this device: two fast-charging USB-C for your phone and laptop, plus a USB-A for other devices. The USB-C ports are capable of 100W output when used alone, but you can also use all three at

<p>PC laptop trackpads are really good now. The average laptop trackpad works well, and many even feel downright great. But there’s one big upgrade that can take your laptop trackpad experience to the next level — a haptic trackpad.</p>



<p>Haptic trackpads are still tough to find on modern PC laptops, but they’re getting there — as we see in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2375677/surface-laptop-2024-review-a-new-era-for-windows-laptops.html">Microsoft’s latest Surface Laptops</a>. All else being equal, haptic trackpads offer a much nicer controlling-a-mouse-with-your-finger experience than typical trackpads, elevating any laptop to the next tier of premium feel.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever used a haptic trackpad, you know exactly what I’m talking about. But if you haven’t had the pleasure of using one yet, here’s why they’re awesome and why you’ll w

<p>Maybe you just subscribed to a new VPN service and are already regretting it. Or maybe you’re a long-time subscriber and your old provider just isn’t cutting it any longer. Perhaps your current VPN is in hot water for selling user data or a competitor has better pricing. </p>



<p>The VPN market is in constant flux, with the relative quality of services and features vacillating between providers at any given time. What was the fastest VPN or had the most servers last year may look different now. Given this, there are a myriad of potential reasons to switch VPNs. But should you? I’ll break down the best reasons to help you decide if it’s time to consider a change.</p>



<p><strong>Your VPN is too expensive</strong></p>



<p>On the surface, this reason is pretty simple: Your current VPN costs too much money and a competitor is cheaper. And this is good lo
