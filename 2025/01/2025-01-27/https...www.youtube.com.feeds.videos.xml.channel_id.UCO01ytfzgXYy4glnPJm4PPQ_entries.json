        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Donald Trump shows what it's like when the United States actually acts like the most powerful nation in the world. With a couple of posts on social media, he forced an entire country to submit. Also, JD Vance does the cable news rounds and it doesn\u2019t go well for the news anchors. Trump is accused of cruelty when he pulls security off of Fauci, John Bolton, and other ex-bureaucrats. But why should taxpayers fund their security, anyway? New York City considers a new law that seems specifically designed to annoy me personally. And federal government workers are now living in fear under the Trump administration. This is supposed to be a bad thing, according to the media.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:35 Opening\n02:11 - 21:13 Trump Teaches Colombia A Hard Lesson\n21:19 - 37:59 Vance Gives Amazing Response To CBS Reporter On Immigration\n38:00 - 43:21 Trump Cancels Fauci's Taxpayer-Funded Security Detail\n43:22 - 46:56 New Yorkers May Be Allowed To Take Paid Sick Leav",
