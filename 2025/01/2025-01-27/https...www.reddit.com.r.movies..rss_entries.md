## James Cagney isn't my cup of tea but "Angels with Dirty Faces" (1938) is so good that I never miss it when it's on.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I enjoyed the theme of sacrifice and redemption and this was not a gangster movie that glamorizes mob life or focuses too much about being a criminal and killing. It&#39;s actually more about the protagonist, Rocky Sullivan (James Cagney), who&#39;s a notorious gangster just out of prison. His childhood best friend is Fr Jerry Connolly (Pat O&#39;Brien) who&#39;s now a Priest and yearns to reform the juvenile delinquents in the neighborhood, played by (the very annoying) Dead End Kids. </p> <p>Rocky comes into play because he starts associating himself with the boys in the neighborhood while still behaving like a big shot. When Rocky kills a few fellow gangsters who turned on him and he&#39;s caught and sentenced to die, Father Jerry asks Rocky for the ultimate sacrifice. </p> <p>This was a genuinely good movie. Cagney is brilliant in this, tough and full of bravado but also a nice guy underneath the tough exterior. O&#39;Brien noble and a voice of r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Harrison Ford was one of my favorite actors growing up yet I can&#39;t help feeling that was some lost opportunity in his career.</p> <p>He made two amazing dramas with Peter Weir back to back (Witness, The Mosquito Coast) yet they never worked together again. A Weir-Ford collaboration akin to Scorsese-De Niro would have been something. I don&#39;t know the behind the scenes of it all and maybe Weir and Ford tried to make other projects but they fell through.</p> <p>Ford was also heavily recruited for the Michael Douglas role in Steven Soderbergh&#39;s Traffic. I just don&#39;t get turning down Soderbergh, you know? And Soderbergh likes to collaborate with his actors he has worked with before. A Soderbergh-Ford pairing over multiple movies would have been something to see.</p> <p>I just think Ford lessened his dramatic ambitions and retreated to mediocre thrillers and callbacks to earlier roles that sometimes worked (Blade Runner 2049) and sometimes

Basically, the opposite of greatest films ever made. But you enjoyed it and relish rewatching it.</p> <p>Here are mine:</p> <ol> <li>DOA: Dead or Alive (2006)</li> </ol> <p>On its release it was dragged by &#39;serious&#39; cinema people as schlock, the gamer fans disparaged Devon Aoki as not looking like Kasumi at all and yet the wire work and fight choreography was a lot of fun to watch, personally. Holly Valance brought charisma to her role as Christie, and Jaime Pressly was charming in an all-american way. The pre-covid aughts era involved a lot of mindless fun, and it is sorely missed today.</p> <ol> <li>Blood: The Last Vampire (2009)</li> </ol> <p>Criticised for not having the finesse of the anime, but still a serviceable action flick if rather silly.</p> <ol> <li>American Satan (2017)</li> </

Next, Micro, State of Fear - in the hands of the right screenwriter &amp; director, any of those would be a badass film.

## The Equalizer trilogy with Denzel Washington is phenomenal

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Denzel really owned this role, and made every film so enjoyable to watch, but these films absolutely delivered on the simple premise of a badass, retired ex D.I.A Vigilante delivering justice to the bad guys and being the guardian angel of death to the hopeless that need him. Im gonna do my best to avoid spoilers.</p> <p>Equalizer 1- My personal favorite out of the trilogy. The mystique of robert Mcall was at it&#39;s highest due to how little we knew about him, and we see the duality of his character by how he could be such a wise, supportive, kind hearted person that pushes others around him to be the best they can be, but also an absolute, cold, calculating, menacing killer to the ones that deserve it. Great acting, despicable villians, feel good vigilante justice, and a good ending.</p> <p>Equalizer 2- The theme of this is revenge, and this is really personal for Robert Mcall. Good classic vigilante justice, with also Robert being a great father
