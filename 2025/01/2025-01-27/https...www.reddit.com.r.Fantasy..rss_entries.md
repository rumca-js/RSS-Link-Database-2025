## I don't care about magic systems. There, I said it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is just as the title suggests. I know I will get slaughtered for this opinion but I have to say, magic systems in fantasy bore me. It&#39;s not that they aren&#39;t written well, it&#39;s just that I personally don&#39;t enjoy them, at least the really hard magic systems. For instance, I love the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, but the detailed magic system I just find boring. It was part of the reason I didn&#39;t like the Navani chapters in Rythm of War. (Don&#39;t want to get into spoilers.) Maybe this is just me, but I enjoy magic I just don&#39;t enjoy magic systems that are more scientific for a lack of a better word. So yeah, feel free to revoke my Fantasy privileges if you like!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/soloalien5"> /u/soloalien5 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ibjiwi/i_dont_care_about_magic_systems_there_i_said_it/">[link]</a></sp

## Witchy woodsy books

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe this has been discussed before, but it seems like there is a recently emerging sub-genre of books with woodsy settings, and typically female protagonists with emerging magic ability, and typically Eastern European folklore-based fantastic creatures.</p> <p>I suppose the well-known books for this category are Novik&#39;s Uprooted / Spinning Siliver and Kathernie Arden&#39;s Winternight trilogy. But also I recently read Where the Dark Stands Still by A.B. Poranek, which is very much along the same lines. And I think A.G. Slatter&#39;s books have a similar feeling, even though they might be more Irish than Eastern European. (To be honest I&#39;ve only read one book by Slatter so far.)</p> <p>Are there more books or authors that fit this trend (if it is a trend)? And is there a good name for this style of story?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/isaiahHat"> /u/isaiahHat </a> <br/> <span><a href="

I watched the first The Hobbit (I think) as a little kid and thought Bilbo Baggins was silly and cute, but my brain was small, and I fell asleep halfway through.</p> <p>This year I want to get into reading fiction. I like reading, and have historically read nonfiction. Fiction I do read is almost exclusively non-genre (All cards on the table, I’m intimidated by genre fiction. Literary is what they teach in schools and what I’ve always written in).

## Characters that mask their darker personality from others

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’d like some recommendations for main characters that are morally grey who conceal their darker personality from others. </p> <p>So for example, they could actually be incredibly ruthless and heartless when push comes to shove, but that isn’t widely known by the majority of people. So when that side of them is revealed, it’s like a big oh shit moment. This can include deceiving the reader as well (though I guess this can technically be a spoiler, I don’t mind).</p> <p>I feel like there a plenty of morally grey characters who are already known and feared almost right out from the gate. I don’t mind if that happens eventually, but I would like to see the process if it does happen.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlamingPixels"> /u/FlamingPixels </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ib56oc/characters_that_mask_their_darker_personality/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><

## Italian translation of Wheel of time entire series on sale on Google Books, 1,99 € each book: worth it?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. As I said in the title, I found out Google Books has the 14 main books and the prequel New Spring on sale, although it&#39;s only the italian translation. Every e-book is 1,99 €, and because of the Google Rewards app I have more than enough credit to buy all the books, around 30 €. I don&#39;t know, anyway, if it&#39;s worth it, both from a quality perspective (I am Italian, but I don&#39;t know if the translation is any good) and from an &quot;economical&quot; one. Is there any chance the enligh version gets the same sale? Or a better one, like 0,99 € each book? Maybe with an Humble Bundle offer...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MrSchweitzer"> /u/MrSchweitzer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ib4vh0/italian_translation_of_wheel_of_time_entire/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ib4vh0/italian_translation_o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So for years I have been searching books that can scratch the same itch h that this book series can. I have given up but discovered this woenderful subreddit and thought I might give it a shot asking you guys. Sadly the series is super unknown so I couldn’t find recommendations from people who read it maybe some of you have. It’s probably my favourite book series of all time . Online the MC and his woenderful friendship with various supporting characters, love the Irish mythology, thst the world is actually impacted by the plot, the god like powers, the antagonists are so intriguing and the series wraps up wonderfully. If anyone has read this and has any ideas what I could read with a similar vibe I need your help! For anyone that hasn’t read it, I cannot e commend it enough! Have a great day! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maximazing98"> /u/maximazing98 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I loved The Scholar and the Last Faerie Door. It certainly owes something to both Brideshead Revisited and R. F. Kuang&#39;s Babel, plus the real-life pain and social disruption caused by World War 1. Including more women being admitted to British universities--with most of the young men off to war or dead, real-life universities were hungry for students, even if female. The book is still overall very original. </p> <p>Now I am wondering whether to embark on A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians and its sequel A Radical Act of Free Magic. I took an in-depth college seminar on the French Revolution and its aftermath (which lasted well into the 19th century), and have done some reading since. And . . . I don&#39;t want to read the same thing all over again but with magic layered on. There was plenty of social inequality even without magic. And &quot;same old French Revolution with magic&quot; just seems unoriginal. </p> <p>Thoughts from those who ha
