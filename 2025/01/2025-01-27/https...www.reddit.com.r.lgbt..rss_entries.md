<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hii! My band is writing a Riot Grrrl song but trying to be inclusive, and one line is asking all girls, women and queers to come up to the front. I myself like the term queer, but am not sure about using it as a noun. alternatives like saying “queer people” don’t sound as great. What do y’all think? Is it ok to use in this context? any alternate suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Forward-Tale-6644"> /u/Forward-Tale-6644 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ibit10/is_it_ok_to_say_queers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ibit10/is_it_ok_to_say_queers/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, hi. I&#39;m a cis girl (maybe? I dunno at this point). Lately, I&#39;ve been thinking. I don&#39;t really care about my gender and pronouns. I only identify as a girl because that&#39;s what I was born as and I dont feel connected to any other gender, nor do I feel connected in any way to being female other than that&#39;s what I was born as.</p> <p>This got me wondering whether that&#39;s normal for a cis person? Because I feel like some of the people I know would be like &quot;no, I could never identify as a gender I wasn&#39;t born as&quot; but like, I just.. wouldn&#39;t care. Like, if someone told me I had to identify as a guy and use he/him or nonbinary and they/them or any other combination of gender and pronouns, I&#39;d do it without complaint. I wouldn&#39;t care.</p> <p>Like, I do like being mostly feminine presenting, and I have nothing against my physical form, but, like, I just don&#39;t feel connected to any gender or pronouns apar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi I’m a teen who’s turning 18, living in a conservative country(where the anti-lgbt protest is going wild rn) with my Christian parents. Recently I hinted my parents about my sexuality and… they kinda said something very homophobic and hurting. They literally disregarded my sexuality, saying something like my feelings aren’t real. They don’t even know my 5 years struggle and how scared I was, since there was nobody to help me out when I was starting to question my sexuality. Which hurt me the most was that it was my parents. I love them so much, they are such a nice people but why would they say such things like that? I thought parents were my everything, who would stand for me no matter what. Now I don’t know what to do. Even my therapist doesn’t understand me. I tried opening about my sexuality and… she agreed with my parents. She said it might be just my ocd. I’m so scared, what if I’m wrong and they are right. What if my parents disown me when I

This was the last straw. They&#39;ve treated me poorly for being queer. They&#39;ve treated me poorly for being atheist. They constantly spew hate everytime I&#39;m around them. I even asked if they could not discuss politics when I come around them and they said they can try, but no promises. They couldn&#39;t even do that for me. It hurts so much. I never say anything bad about their god, even though I&#39;m also an antitheist, but they are constantly belittling queer people even though I&#39;m literally one of them. I can&#39;t take it anymore. I decided to delete my Facebook and made a new one where I won&#39;t accept any friend requests from them. And I won&#39;t be attending anymore family events.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think someone needs to speak up about this topic because many countries, like Russia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and others, remain largely overlooked when discussing global LGBTQ+ rights. In these transphobic and homophobic countries, the simple act of being yourself can lead to severe consequences, ranging from social rejection to legal persecution. People face daily threats of imprisonment or even the death penalty (though only some countries punished LGBTQ+ individuals with death penalty and it&#39;s rare) simply for expressing their true identity. The lack of legal recognition—such as the inability to marry someone of the same-sex or access gender-affirming care and surgeries—further deepens the suffering of people living in such tough environment. These countries and the people living in them endure UNIMAGINABLE suffering, pain and hardships, and yet their struggles often go unnoticed in global discussions about human rights and equality.
