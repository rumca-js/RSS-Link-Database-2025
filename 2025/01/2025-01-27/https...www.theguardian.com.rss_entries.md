<p>Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, now 99, escaped death in the concentration camp because she played the cello. As this intelligent, chilling and devastating documentary shows, music proved a curse and a comfort</p><p>Auschwitz was a site of incomparable horror; people arriving at the concentration camp knew it would be hell on earth. So it was a shock to be greeted by a band playing Mozart’s Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Was this some kind of breathtakingly sick joke? A demonstration of German cultural superiority? A suggestion that the camp “cannot be that bad”, as one survivor recalls hoping? Or was it a sign, as another remembers thinking, that the Nazis really were “crazy”?</p><p>The truth was complex and chilling, as Toby Trackman’s exceptionally moving and intelligent documentary goes on to explore. The role of music in the Holocaust might initially seem a somewhat marginal topic. Is the fact there were orchestras at Auschwitz really that important in the grand scheme of things? Yes, as it

Is the top of the Championship better than the bottom of the Prem? We’ll find out next season. Burnley need a four-goal win to go top tonight, but I’m thinking a regulation Scott Parker 1-0 would do them. Leeds will need all of their 66% possession to break down the Clarets’ defence.

<p>‘It wasn’t a hit at the time, but when it was later used in an advert, I got paid 100 grand. I was still using drugs and the money was gone in a year’</p><p>This song was triggered by meeting someone who had started hanging around our rehearsal rooms in King’s Cross, London. She was very Felliniesque and looked as if she had stepped out of 8 ½. She was an extremely eccentric character and one day she pulled a knife on another girl who was there. I was fascinated by her, not in a romantic way, but to observe, as a curiosity. At that age, 25, I was still into exploring the world and meeting different people you find fascinating or fall in love with. So in the song I used the analogy of exploring the universe. At the same time, I was exploring other things, but the song is not about drugs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jan/27/how-the-only-ones-made-another-girl-another-planet">Continue reading...</a>

Coincidentally that happens to be Freeman’s super-strength on a rugby field as well. His club coach, Sam Vesty, long ago spotted him as the type of player who makes most impact when he backs his instincts.

<p>Blues set targets high, Holdt hits the ground running for Spurs and have the Foxes dug themselves out of a hole?</p><p>Sonia Bompastor may shy away from talk of a quadruple and unbeaten season but the England and Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze is not. The full-back told the BBC the players “want to go the season unbeaten” after their 1-0 win over Arsenal maintained their unbeaten run under Bompastor in the WSL, as they ended the weekend with a seven-point cushion at the top, and nine over third-placed Manchester City. “We’ve never won the Champions League. We’ve got five league titles in a row but [going] unbeaten [would be] unbelievable. We’re on a good road to doing that,” said Bronze. Are these realistic targets? Increasingly, yes. The perfect performances haven’t always been there in the first half of the season, a natural thing give the managerial change in the summer, but they have still won 11 of their 12 games, drawing the other.

The opening of Trump’s second speech, however, began with the myth of the golden age — an almost idyllic picture of an end to America’s time of troubles, when the country elicits envy and respect it once enjoyed among the powers of the earth. And, far more clearly than in his first inaugural and term, Trump’s speech and stratagems indicate a vision not just of competition but of return to comparative ascendancy. He wants America to bask in the sun of its former victory i

<p>A thrifty and delicious store-cupboard meal</p><p>I have known for months, maybe even a year, that a tin of tuna had fallen down the back of the cupboard. It was only when a tin of sardines followed it, and got stuck on the way, that I finally pulled everything out to save them. In return, they saved dinner.</p><p>Putting fish in a tin is a sustainable act (in principle, anyway), because it gives almost everlasting life to a product with an extremely short shelf life and an extremely high risk of waste. Another thing about tinned fish is the deep umami flavour that can develop during the curing and canning process (especially when the fish is preserved in a good-tasting brine or oil), which is not only deeply delicious, but thrifty, meaning that a small amount goes a long way. However, both these things depend on countless tangled factors.

His voice work in Finding Nemo and his Oscar-nominated turn in Broadcast News gave him a respectable level of recognition and acclaim.

As a writer-director-leading man, he produced some of the funniest, most insightful comedies of the 80s and 90s, often with biting social commentary. But when I need the January blues lifted, I turn to his wonderfully sentimental and uplifting 1991 film Defending Your Life.</p><p>Brooks plays Daniel Miller, a divorced, lonely adman with little in his life besides a new BMW.

They compiled a record of 95-24-7, and that winning percentage of .798 was a full 70 percentage points higher than the second-best team, the Dallas Cowboys. Those Raiders were packed with future Hall of Famers, and they had John Madden, one of the NFL’s best coaches, for most of that span.</p><p>And throughout that time, they were stopped from winning the big one by several different dynasties. They lost Super Bowl II to the Green Bay Packers, and were crossed off in successive seasons in the playoffs by the Miami Dolphins and the Pittsburgh Steelers – two more all-time teams.

It will be some time until Ruben Amorim can stage high-end entertainment of a Wolf Hall standard but at least relegation is now unlikely to be the series conclusion. United fans were singing the manager’s name once Lisandro Martínez’s fortuitous winner span in. A fragile belief is growing. Such are the lenses on United any result is seen as a signifier, but beating Fulham is not a return of the glory days. The last United manager to lose at Craven Cottage was Sir Alex Ferguson himself. Amorim should take heart from a more solid defensive performance, Harry Maguire the organising heart of the trio, Martínez aggressive and provocative alongside him, looking closer to be the player he promised to be two seasons ago.

Not the panorama of 80 snow-capped, jagged peaks that top 3,000 metres, nor the lone skier carving perfect turns down a forest-fringed piste. They are lovely, of course, but the important view, the one that few winter sports enthusiasts will ever get to see, is behind a nondescript door next to the bakery that’s tucked beside the ski lift station in the bottom of this valley.

He kept his trousers up with a rope; his habitual bomber jacket was patched with sticky tape, as was the cracked rear window of his car. He worked as a labourer and his regular haunts were Warrington pubs, the rougher the better, and the local Betfred.</p><p>But when Eric Tucker died, aged 86, in 2018, more than 500 paintings were found in the small council house he had long shared with his mother. The works, of the highest quality, depicted mid-20th-century working-class northern life. Many showed blurry, smoke-filled pub interiors, beautifully composed&nbsp;and full of slightly grotesque figures, typically side-o

Then Ele came into my life and changed my morning routine. Now I am drawn from deep slumber by a trill of notes, an arpeggio perhaps or some soft chords, as I roll between the last fragments of dream and the day ahead. My wife is adamant: no alarms, no bells, no sirens. Instead, the radio gently rises in volume until some note of whatever is playing rouses me from my dream state into reality.</p><p>After the trill, one of us creeps downstairs to put on tea and, while the old dog eats her breakfast, arranges the pleasing array of a small, not-too-sweet biscuit or two, a bow

Was the book political in nature? Off to the ministry of information. Religious? To the ministry of religious affairs (<em>awqaf</em>). Literature? To the Union of Arab Books. All were a front for the Syrian security services, who would pore over the suggested titles, and in the best-case scenario, approve the book with exhaustive line-by-line corrections, or in the worst-case scenario, reject the book in its entirety.</p><p>Even with approval, a book’s shelf life could be short.
