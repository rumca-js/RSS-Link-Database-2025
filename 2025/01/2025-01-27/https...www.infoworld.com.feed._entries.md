<p>A clean slate. A fresh start. The new broom sweeps clean. The folk sayings are in agreement. Sure, your favorite old programming language is comfortable and easy to use. You know the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3269878/what-is-an-api-application-programming-interfaces-explained.html">APIs</a> and libraries backward and forward. But you also know all the glitches, bugs, and failure modes that go with it. What was once perfect has gone a bit stale.</p>



<p>A new language is just the thing, and it seems dozens of great new ones launch every year. Programmers love to innovate and one of the fundamental strategies of innovation is creating something new that wipes away all the old p

<p>Like pretty much any security tool, picking a <a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/use-cases/sast-secret-scanning">SAST</a> (static application security testing) tool isn’t a matter of “What’s the best?” but rather “What’s the best <em>for me</em>?” Whether you already have a tool that needs replacing or you’re starting from greenfield, it’s helpful to understand the market so you can narrow down your choices.</p>



<p>Although the process of statically analyzing source code has been around as long as computers have existed, the market for SAST as a security tool didn’t emerge until the 1990s. Today the tools we know as SAST generally fall into two buckets (“generally” because there’s always som
