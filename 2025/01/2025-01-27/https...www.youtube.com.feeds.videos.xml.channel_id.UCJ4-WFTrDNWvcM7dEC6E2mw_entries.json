Get the game with our affiliate link https://links.malediction.gg/pott-gamefound and you too can battle for powerful relics while helping the channel.\n\nIn our second game we try two other factions: Order of the Shattered Throne and Legion of the Fallen. We learned a lot from our first game and look to try new things and explore more actions in this game. \n\nMB01KO3M2OOGUZX",
