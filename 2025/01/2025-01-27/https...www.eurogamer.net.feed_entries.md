CES 2025 was innovative, dynamic and exciting on a number of levels, game releases are actually happening and the excitement for the year ahead is palpable. Microsoft's Developer_Direct just added to the hype, delivering four very different, very impressive looking games. We discuss all of them in the latest edition of DF Direct Weekly, but I'm going to focus on Doom: The Dark Ages in this particular blog. It looks fantastic!</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-doom-the-dark-ages-pushes-current-gen-tech-hard-and-it-looks-phenomenal">Read more</a></p>

A bunch of magic-users known as Weavers are attempting to recover their cultural homeland, which has been sealed behind a mystical barrier for ages. I am always up for any decent pulpy story that involves getting a gang of misfits together and returning to a hallowed place after centuries have passed. You know, and then trying to find out what went wrong.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">Read more</a></p>

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Sniper_Elite_Resistance_header.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>I love killing stuff. Always have. It's good for the soul, I reckon. It's tough to fester rage and resentment when you've just slo-mo-shot a Nazi in the gonads (hey, there's an achievement for it!), which is why I'll shortly be petitioning the NHS to have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> available on prescription. It can't pay off your credit card or make your nine-to-five any more palatable, no, but an hour of this a night <em>has</em> to be good for you. Like an apple a day. Or flossing. But, you know, violent.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sniper-elite-resistance-review">Read more</a></p>

"Is it just me," bellows one orc to another in a goofy baritone, over the boom of drums and cannon fire, "or are these traps getting stronger?" Seconds later, he rounds the corner into a shipyard and steps onto a briar patch which, by rights, ought not to be there. Not to mention the auto-crossbows firing from the ceiling, the plants belching poison from the corner, and the saw blades ricocheting off the walls. Uruk-bye, my perceptive friend. That's a four-times combo.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-review">Read more</a></p>
