The rare outages come at a time of nascent consolidation in the world's second-largest oil refining industry as an earlier-than-expected peak in Chinese fuel demand and Beijing's drive to wring out inefficiency starts to squeeze out the weakest of the small independent plants, known as teapots.  At least four plants with a combined annual processing capacity of approximately 18 million metric tons, or 320,000 barrels per day, either closed crude oil distillation units (CDUs) this month or plan to in February after Beijing cut rebates on consumption tax paid for feedstock imports, the sources said.",

The world's biggest cryptocurrency struggled to make gains last week, as a rally that had seen it break above $100,000 after U.S. President Donald Trump's election ran out of steam.  At 1156 GMT, bitcoin was at $98,852.17, down around 6% on the day, having fallen sharply in early trading to hit its lowest since Jan. 16.",
