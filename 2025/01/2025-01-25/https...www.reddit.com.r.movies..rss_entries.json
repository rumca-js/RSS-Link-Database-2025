How was he involved? How did he know the clothes? Why pigs blood? This part has always really confused me! I\u2019ve rewatched so many times. </p> <p>Do you guys think Alex is challenged due to years of abuse? Also, Keller was SO valid bringing up the fact he shouldn\u2019t drive with the mindset of a 10 year old, I really loved Detective Loki, but hate that he blew this off. He invested so much time into this &amp; didn\u2019t bother looking further into Alex\u2019s history? I feel like he would\u2019ve found out he was kidnapped if he dug deeper. It\u2019s crazy how he did not put two &amp; two together after talking with Alex\u2019s real mother.

It\u2019s baffling how a movie of this scale, with a cast full of internationally recognized actors, didn\u2019t invest in proper dialect coaching. Mexican audiences, myself included, are extremely upset by how the film handles the Spanish language\u2014or rather, \u201cbutchers\u201d it. </p> <p>Selena Gomez doesn\u2019t even attempt to explain or adjust her poor pronunciation. Then there\u2019s Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a, whose character conveniently throws in a \u201cDeus ex machina\u201d explanation that she was born in the Dominican Republic to justify her accent. And Sofia Gascon? Her voice had to be AI generated because she couldn\u2019t even sing the notes of the songs. </p> <p>It\u2019s as if the production, being French, didn\u2019t even bother to take the language seriously. The songs\u2014written in French and awkwardly translated into Spanish\u2014make little to no sense",

Spielberg and Lucas have long said that &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; was born from their desire to make a James Bond film, mixed with the 1930s action serials they also used to love. There&#39;s a bunch of James Bond castings in the Indiana Jones franchise - namely Sean Connery, but also Allison Doody and Julian Glover as well.</p> <p>Another example is &quot;Joker&quot; taking cues from DeNiro films &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;The King of Comedy,&quot; with them ultimately casting Robert DeNiro in their film as well.</p> <p>What other examples exist of this?

The film centers on fraternal twins as they find themselves separated by the government following the death of their father. The boy ends up with a cultish family and the girl ends up with a couple of childless swingers. It only gets weirder and darker from there. The themes are heavy, and you will find yourself crying in spots. The film deals with death and sexual deviance, and is most definitely not for kids, as I found myself having to explain what a feeding fetish was to our 13 yr old. Over a period of years, the twins get shit on all through life until their reunion. There are a couple of laughs scattered about, but it isn&#39;t supposed to be funny, the humor is very dry. The best character is Pinky, an old widow who befriends the girl, and she has lived quite a life. She brings some much needed levity during",

Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, The Good the Bad and the Ugly are some of my most favorite movies and all have stellar soundtracks. For me, even mediocre movies like Interstellar and Scarface get major bonus points because of their amazing soundtracks. Guys like Morricone, Zimmer, Williams, and Herrmann don&#39;t receive enough credit for how much they elevated the movies they composed for. I couldn&#39;t have been more ecstatic than when Morricone finally won an Oscar for Hateful Eight after so much brilliance.
