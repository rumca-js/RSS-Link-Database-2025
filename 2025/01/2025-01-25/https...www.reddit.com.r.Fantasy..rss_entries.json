        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m about 70% through book two of the Licanius Trilogy and I&#39;m very MEH about it. The characters are fun yet I feel let down with their character development and with the world building. I almost feel spoiled after reading Red Rising and Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Cosmere. I&#39;m gonna finish book 2 but idk if I&#39;m gonna pick up book 3. I just feel very whelmed about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/13SpiderMonkeys\"> /u/13SpiderMonkeys </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i9e4nw/licanus_trilogy_is_meh/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i9e4nw/licanus_trilogy_is_meh/\">[comments]</a></span>",
