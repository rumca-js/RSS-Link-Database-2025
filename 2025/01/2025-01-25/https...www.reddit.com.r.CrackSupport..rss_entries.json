I have a Fitgirls download of the Sims 4, which is working fine, but doesn&#39;t include latest game updates or some of the newer expansion and add on packs. I&#39;m wondering, after I download a new (cracked) version of the sims 4 can I keep and play older save files, created using less expansion packs and older content, if I copy the files and resave into my new game files, or will I encounter issues when loading these families and content? I really want to play horse ranch expansion for example, but also don&#39;t want to lost my older, legacy families or builds. If not possible, what would you recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Electrical_Pea_8651\"> /u/Electrical_Pea_8651 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1i9uegg/will_i_lose_saves_if_i_replace_fitgirls_sims_4/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSup",
