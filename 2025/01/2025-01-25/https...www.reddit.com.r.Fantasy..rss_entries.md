This book has a lot of my favorite SF tropes, but not in a way that feels dated despite it likely originating or codifying a lot of these tropes: exploration of weird space objects, complex solar system politics between interesting planetary cultures, an intersection of science and religion in a way that feels authentic and insightful, and more.

I think what I really liked was the slice of life aspect and that it takes place over a long time. So you really get to see characters grow up, fall in love and have children of their own. Without having to do huge time skips.</p> <p>I think what I’m looking for is something along the lines of Anne of Green Gables or Little Women if they took place in a fantasy world.</p> <p>Harry Potter also fits the bill, though I’d prefer somewhat older characters (stories that continue into their adult lives). As such it would probably be good if there are already a lot of books published preferably really thick ones.</p> <p>Also it’d be great if there are audiobooks available. So if anybody knows something that fits, I’d be grateful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eeveelotta"> /u/eeveelotta </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht

I have literally used him as an example of the opposite. To me, he is a master at constructing elaborate magic systems, weaving plots together, and conveying it in clear prose that is invisible to the reader. </p> <p>But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s slow burn. Robin Hobb is slow burn. Patrick Rothfuss is slow burn. To me, slow burn means evocative language, character-driven, immersive, slow (or maybe moderately paced) writing that takes its time to set things up but then takes the reader on a ride that resonates for years later.
