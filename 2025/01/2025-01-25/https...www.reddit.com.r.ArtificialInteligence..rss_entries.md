<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like all writers and artists, I&#39;ve been paying close attention to the rise of AI and what it could mean for creators like us. Everyone worries about how these devices will make us obsolete, and the world will drown in fake, soulless content. I do share some of these fears, but not all of them. My biggest worry is how corporations will use AI to save money and artists and writers will lose their jobs. I can tolerate a light touch now and then, like using it to smooth out special effects, but I abhor the idea of Hollywood churning out stories written with AI. </p> <p>That said, I also think about what AI could provide not just for movie studios and corporations, but for the creators themselves. What could it do for the broke unpublished writers, the starving artists? Instead of letting it replace us, we should use it to expand and diversify our mediums. Imagine if every novel could be a graphic novel thanks to AI. Imagine if every book could have a
