        "description": "Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered releases February 14th for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It\u2019s a fascinating examination of how to restore and remaster the best and worst of a beloved series. \n\nThe developer seems to be on the right track with their enhanced textures and modernized resolution, but it\u2019s all the quality of life enhancements and restored content that excites us. Photo mode makes a return, and with it new Lara outfits and poses. \n\nMy favorite feature in remasters is switching between original and enhanced graphics with the push of a button, and that returns as well. Tomb Raider VI is getting a bunch of restored content such as new item shop inventory, new abilities for the other playable character, and a training area. Hopefully, the developer's improvements to the controls and visuals will enhance the critically panned Tomb Raider VI as much as it did the first three games.",

        "description": "Ninja Gaiden 2 Black isn't the definitive way to play the classic, what with the missing content, Sigma 2 changes, and whatnot (and that matters because its $50 price tag is still significant). However, this is the best way to experience Team Ninja's classic on modern platforms. \n\nIts gorgeous fidelity is matched by some of the best hack-and-slash combat ever, even after all these years, and it'll keep you coming back, eager to master its depth.",
