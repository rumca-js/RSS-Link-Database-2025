Probably more honestly though, I doubt I have the skill or brain capacity to make a good deck anyways.</p> <p>I heard about keyforge by the guy who designed MtG as a game that is designed to be collectible, but decks can&#39;t really be changed, you just play the deck as given out if the package. I find that really exciting and thought about buying some decks. Then I found out that the game doesn&#39;t seem to be popular with stores due to some distributer kerfuffle and now it might be turning into a dead game.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m debating if I should try this game, or something else that fits what I&#39;m looking for.

Then, flip the card.</p> <p>Envoy: After you play a card in an adjacent theater, you may move this card so that it covers that card.</p> <p>Envoy was face down and she played retrofit.
