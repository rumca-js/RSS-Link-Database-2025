Now I&#39;m wondering, are there any small, basic hand trackers(controllers) I could use for extra immersion. Right now I can&#39;t hold steering wheel while holding controller. I don&#39;t need anything fancy, once controller gets close to the steering wheel it grabs it automatically. So no finger tracking is needed. The smaller it would be, the better.
