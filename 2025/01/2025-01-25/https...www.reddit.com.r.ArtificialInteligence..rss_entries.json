Now, I\u2019m considering changing the approach and using <strong>pre-trained models directly</strong> without Fine-tuning, focusing on delivering a complete product. In this case, my focus would be on inputting the video into the system, then segmenting the data based on fixed time intervals, preprocessing the raw data, sending it to the models, and analyzing the results at the frame level and for the video as a whole. Does this approach qualify as a complete project that can be submitted, or would it be considered too simple, and is it better to stick with the <strong>Fine-tuning</strong> approach?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lama_777a\"> /u/lama_777a </a> <br/> <span><",
