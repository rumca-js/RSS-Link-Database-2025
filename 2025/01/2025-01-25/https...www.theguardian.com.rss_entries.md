<p>Engaging with councils, universities and developers will be key to bringing the economy back to life</p><p>It has been a tough beginning to the year for Rachel Reeves. The chancellor has found herself in the spotlight as debt interest costs spiralled, while consumer and business confidence fell. Manufacturers, hampered by high energy costs and the consequences of Brexit, are struggling, while Donald Trump’s threats against those who dare to trade with the US are unsettling.</p><p>It’s not a completely new situation. Since the budget, Reeves has been criticised for the mix of tax rises and higher borrowing needed for what is only a modest rise in government spending over the next couple of years. Businesses are angry that much of the tax burden has fallen on them. Consumers, uncertain about the nation’s prospects, hunker down. If they spend big, it’s on a foreign holiday to escape the gloomy atmosphere at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/25/the-

Hornby has since written two further novels set in the extended Austen family, the latest of which, <em>The Elopement</em>, will be released in May. She lives in Kintbury, B

<p>The EU is facing a torrid year ahead from enemies both within and without. But it is still far from a lost cause</p><p>Europe is in trouble. Multiple, long-simmering external and internal challenges are coming to the boil. Taken together, they comprise the modern EU’s biggest existential test since its creation in the early 1990s. But strong, united leadership is lacking. Questioning Europe’s will to survive, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, warned last week of a “<a href="https://polish-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/the-speech-of-polish-prime-minister-at-the-european-parliament-europe-is-not-yet-lost-as-long-as-we-are-alive/">spiritual crisis</a>”, of a “palpable mood of uncertainty, of loss.”</p><p>The EU’s borders, democracies, laws and liberties are threatened by an aggressive Russian nihilism.

<p>Even if it seems inevitable Arsenal will dispute PGMOL’s definition of “serious foul play” in the coming days, after the referee Michael Oliver’s remarkable call to punish Myles Lewis-Skelly for a cynical trip with a red card, Mikel Arteta will take great satisfaction from this victory at Wolves. The defender’s first-half sending-off will dominate the discourse but the substitute Riccardo Calafiori’s priceless winner, after Wolves were themselves reduced to 10 men when João Gomes was given a second yellow card, ensured they stay in the hunt for the title.</p><p>The problems are piling up for Wolves, who succumbed to a fourth straight defeat in which their only bona fide striker, Jørgen Strand Larsen, limp down the tunnel.

Admittedly, its reputation, ongoing greatness and – here’s the real marvel – fairly priced menu mean it’s sometimes tricky to bag a table, even if you’re a faithful, polite and grateful (grovelling) local like me; if one mark of an ideal neighbourhood restaurant has to do with spontaneity, then I suppose in this sense, it’s not entirely perfect.</p><p>But still, its existence seems like a kind of miracle to me, even as it prepares to celebrate its 15th birthday.

<p>For 10 days in the summer, the forests of Japan’s Yamagata prefecture are lit up by <em>himebotaru</em>, a type of firefly endemic to the region. Photographer <a href="https://kazuakikoseki.com/pg96.html">Kazuaki Koseki</a> has attempted to capture the phenomenon in his Summer Faeries series, compiled over a period of eight years. “The spectacle of fireflies flying through the summer forest is like the twinkling of a starry sky,” says Koseki. “That sight is fantastic enough to forget the awe of the night forest.” In recent years, the fireflies’ habitat has been increasingly endangered by deforestation and the tourism industry. “The unpredictability of the fireflies’ trails of light highlights the urgency of our planet’s climate crisis, while at the same time holding a strong and enduring hope for the future.”</p><ul><li><a href="https://instagram.com/isseycraft">See more on Instagram at isseycraft</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/jan/25/

This was not because of a power outage, but because its owner switched it off. For an explanation of why it did so, though, we have to spool back a bit. For years, TikTok has been a thorn in the sides of US legislators and national security officials for two reasons. First, it’s owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, which doubtless does whatever Xi Jinping tells it to do. Second, TikTok hoovers up phenomenally detailed data about its young users. The average session lasts 11 minutes and the video length is about 25 seconds. “That’s 26 ‘episodes’ per session,” <a href="https://medium.com/@profgalloway/tiktok-boom-c47b017bdaad">says blogger

Two years later, he and his wife, Priscilla, a gynaecologist, and their children, Antônia, 12, and Nuno, 8, moved into their purpose-built Scandinavian-inspired cabin and tropical landscaped garden.</p><p>“I had always dreamed of living on a farm and this piece of land was our chance to live in a country house in the middle of the city,” says Breno, owner of the footwear chain <a href="https://www.outershoes.com.br/?srsltid=AfmBOorC0qzszE1umUjMCi3bjr-EP0bxtgYFuObOV79eitgq8svS0EZ-">Outer</a> and, inspired by his new garden, an super-comfortable outdoor furniture range, Memo.

<p>Describing issues of autonomy, femgore, worth and hunger all had ain impact on what I wrote and how I felt about myself, says Lucy Rose</p><p>My conflict with food began before I was born. According to family lore, I couldn’t be sated, even in utero. I consumed <em>everything</em>, apparently putting my twin at such risk that we were delivered prematurely. There are even stories of me climbing into my twin’s crib late at night and stealing their milk bottle, swapping it out with my empty one. I’ve always felt hunger, but I soon learned to associate “want” with shame.</p><p>In 2020, I started working on a novel about mother and daughter cannibals, who lure lost souls to their rural forest homestead and bake them into pies and stews. It wasn’t a conscious choice to write about women with a carnal desire to feast, but slowly, deep into drafting – which is a very physical act for me because I write by longhand – I realised that my relationship with food and consumption was changing.

<p>I was one of a group of Just Stop Oil activists given the longest-ever UK sentences for peaceful protest after blocking a motorway. Six months into my incarceration, this is what I have learned</p><p>Locked in a tiny metal box in a prison transport van rattling its way to HMP Bronzefield, in Middlesex, I felt at peace. I was on trial with four other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/just-stop-oil">Just Stop Oil</a> protesters over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/18/five-just-stop-oil-supporters-jailed-over-protest-that-blocked-m25">group’s non-violent direct action on the M25</a> motorway in 2022. The judge had told the jury to ignore evidence of the climate emergency, and we were not allowed to talk in depth about the climate breakdown when defending our actions.

<p>Work has always been central to the novelist’s existence. So what happened when she found herself caring for her elderly mother and two children – and suddenly unable to write?</p><p>The Portuguese artist Paula Rego once said: “Work is the most important thing in life.” I agree with her. Work defines who we are in the world. It gives us purpose and direction. It is how we manifest ourselves in the sphere of public functionality. Without it, we might come to feel like less effective citizens, taking up physical space with less power to define the shape of our exteriority. I think that what Rego was implying was not that family or the other elements of our lives are not important, but that those things cannot exist in balance without the fact of work. Every day she would go to her studio and immerse herself in her paintings and prints, the nucleus of her existence. When it was finished, she would come out fulfilled, capable of full relaxation and communication with others. I am desc

<p>I wrote a romantic fantasy for myself to cope with my fear and vulnerability. Would it hold?</p><p>It was, without question, the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Which is a bold claim about a breakup with someone I’d known for all of 18 months. I can be a little dramatic sometimes. But honestly? Not about this. I have never known agony like it. An older pain, the kind caused by far more shocking blows dealt to me in the past, seemed to lie dormant in my bones until the anguish of heartbreak reanimated it. I felt all of it – the old pain and the new – erupt at once. My body was burnt up by it.</p><p>In part, the devastation was caused by the rupture catching me unaware, like a natural disaster no one sees coming. It had been my private little earthquake, and it razed me to the ground. Many of us have experienced this kind of breakup. The kind that nothing prepares you for. The kind that leaves you existentially unstable. The kind where the only reasonable response to the f

People are keen to cover their cold and draughty floorboards and sink their feet back in something with a bit more comfort, warmth and depth.

As for renters , a great rug renaissance is in full swing.</p><p>“While wall-to-wall carpets used to be passé, they are definitely having a bit of a moment now,” says Elizabeth Metcalfe, the author of New English Interiors: At Home with Today’s Creatives. “There is a nostalgic charm, but I think they also bring cosiness and warmth to a space – a hugely appealing prospect when we’re faced with rising energy bills.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/25/pile-in-carpet-makes-a-comeback-in-the-maximali

<p>The Greek tragedies ask unpalatable questions. That is why they’re enjoying a revival in 2025</p><p>West End theatre is in a weird and unsettling place. It feels as though something that might once have been good and exciting is coming to an end.

Or ones with star casting, like the much-derided The Tempest with Sigourney Weaver. Which is not to say all of these shows are bad, just that there is a kind of stasis. Nervous producers are chasing post-Covid, theatre-shy audiences at a time when the pipeline of new material flowing in from the increasingly impoverished subsidised theatre world is running dry.</p><p>In this mix, though, there is something surprising: a lot of Sophocles.

I begged her to show me how to make it, and then cooked it for weeks afterwards.

I enjoy cooking it, too, not least because it involves the slow stirring of a pot bursting with vegetables until they become reduced, rich and elemental.

<p>This multigenerational saga of an Iranian family fleeing to the US during the 1979 revolution is both funny and poignant</p><p>“She’d grown pale, her eyes frozen, like she’d seen her own ghost. But aren’t we all exactly that? Each the ghost of an unchosen path,” writes Sanam Mahloudji in her debut, a multigenerational story of five Iranian women from the prestigious Valiat family, separated by personal and political revolutions, and each struggling to accept the path not taken.</p><p>The narrative is shared between the five voices, as it shifts back and forth across 80 years. There is Elizabeth, the&nbsp;matriarch, who – not blessed with the perfect features of her sisters – becomes fixated on her looks (“this is&nbsp;the story of a nose”, she tells us). Eventually she falls in love with a boy who loves her back; unfortunately, that boy is the son of her family’s chauffeur: not an ideal situation in 1940s Tehran.
