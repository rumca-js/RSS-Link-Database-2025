It\u2019s a book made by the BBC weather department weirdly enough and it\u2019s as it says in the title. A book about 188 words used to describe rain in the UK. It sounds so boring but the way it\u2019s written it feels like you\u2019re sat on an old fashioned steam train and you\u2019re getting a tour of the UK just discussing rain. The prose are so cute and cuddly and it feels like I\u2019m being hugged. </p> <p>If you\u2019re from the UK or you\u2019re a bit of an Anglophile then this book will be your next obsession.

I initially read this one because I knew it was short, and I am trying to read a book a week this year for the first time ever. So, I knew going in this would be an easy one to extend that streak. However, I am glad I read it! The classics of English lit of the 19th century is always so fascinating when taken into context of what was happening in that age, and those influences permeate the novella. So, really happy I finished it even if it wasn&#39;t an absolute masterpiece.</p> <p>The obvious theme of this book is the philosophy of the duality of man, as it is even referred to in the text. But the way this metaphor is framed is really interesting and original. In Dr. Henry Jekyll we have a well-respected, well-liked, charitable man, while in Mr. Edward Hyde he has lost",
