<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>So after 8 hours of messing around with django-tenants, i decided to ask you all for some infos.</p> <p>So, my main problem is, how i could handle auth and Users with django-tenants.</p> <p>If i understand correctly, its possible to handle the auth with the &#39;public&#39; main schema and redirect the users to their tenant or let them pick their tenant before redirecting.</p> <p>So far, i only got the model working where i have auth on the public schema and on the tenant schema as well, but this implementation is bad, for several reasons.</p> <p>If anyone has solved this problem already, then please advise.</p> <p>What is the best way to do this? Custom User model and middlewares?</p> <p>PS: im also trying out django-tenant-users now, i&#39;ll report back with my findings</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bouncingdolphins"> /u/bouncingdolphins </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using Django and DRF for my backend. Now I want to generate useful error messages for my frontend which is in React so that the user can act on it. For example, if I have a unique pair constraint for Lesson and Module name and I pass an already used lesson name for the same module, the error I get from Django is &quot;unique pair constraint lesson, module is violated&quot; or something like that. Instead of just forwarding this to the user, I want to send something like, &quot;this lesson name is already used&quot;. I have seen articles about using custom_exceptions_handler but then I have to manually map out every error message. Is there a better way of doing this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggressive-Rip-8435"> /u/Aggressive-Rip-8435 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1i9q3rf/how_to_generate_userfriendly_exception_messages/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>We’re building an API for our app, and while we really want to use Django, we need robust async capabilities since we’ll be making external API requests (e.g., OpenAI, LLMs).</p> <p>We’re torn between Django REST Framework (DRF) and Django Ninja. While Django Ninja supports async out of the box and looks very developer-friendly, we’re concerned about its long-term support and community size compared to DRF. Future-proofing our app is important since this API will be a core part of our project.</p> <p>For those who have used Django Ninja in production, would you recommend it? What are your experiences with its stability and scalability?</p> <p>If not Django Ninja, how would you approach incorporating async functionality into a DRF-based API? Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! We will definitely use Celery for some tasks but rn we&#39;re looking for a solution for immediate responses.</p> <p>Thanks in advan
