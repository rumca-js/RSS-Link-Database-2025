<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just making a USB stick for my files backup.</p> <p>What I&#39;ve previously done in this case is make a new table (GPT) with one partition, then LUKS format that one partition with cryptsetup, then open it, format to ext.4 from the mapper and then mount.</p> <p>However today I was thinking, no, it makes more sense to LUKS format the USB first so it&#39;s all hidden, then make the table and format the partition.</p> <p>But once I opened it in the mapper my brain stopped working and I didn&#39;t know how to make the table, I did make the table on the device in /dev/mapper with one partition but then no subpartitions showed, I don&#39;t know how to access a subpartition from a device in the mapper. So I thought, screw it, let&#39;s just mkfs ext.4 on the device itself (the one in the mapper directory) and it worked.</p> <p>Then I thought, okay it worked but I probably messed it up and it shouldn&#39;t work after this step.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I’m using a ThinkPad with an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U (integrated Radeon graphics) running openSUSE Tumbleweed with the latest kernel 6.13 and Wayland on KDE Plasma. Given the modern hardware and up-to-date kernel with built-in power management (like AMD cpufreq and runtime device power management), I’m wondering if tools like tlp, ppd, power top tools still relevant for improving battery life or thermal performance on newer hardware? Or is the default power management baked in modern Linux distros or I suppose the newest kernel good enough for long battery life? If you’ve tried them or without, did they make a noticeable difference for you? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/linuxhacker01"> /u/linuxhacker01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i9hspy/do_i_still_power_management_tools_on_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all,</p> <p>I picked up last years Razer laptop (they are going to start soldering in memory, booo). I have some older models and wanted an upgrade. They&#39;ve run Linux very well in the past, on this one I&#39;ll be using the Nvidia GPU for work related tasks and running containers for development. I don&#39;t really care if it&#39;s Docker or Podman.</p> <p>I&#39;ve used Ubuntu previously, I&#39;m running Fedora 41 right now. </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if people have any advice on good combinations of kernel and Nvidia driver combo. I ran the Nvidia installer from their .run file everything worked fine. Every once in a while I get a slight flicker on the screen. </p> <p>Wondering if anyone has any pro tips they could share. </p> <p>Kind regards </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sma92878"> /u/sma92878 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i9gf9b/kernel_nvidia_dr
