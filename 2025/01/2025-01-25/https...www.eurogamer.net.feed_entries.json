While multi frame generation features are exclusive to the new GPUs, the existing DLSS super resolution and ray reconstruction technologies are upgraded with a far superior transformer model, which can be used on any RTX card, going all the way back to the 2018 Turing offerings. There are big improvements across the board and we'll be looking at each component DLSS 4 offers, starting today with ray reconstruction. To what extent is quality improved? If the model is indeed more complex than the older convolutional neural network offering, what's the performance impact on legacy RTX cards?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-nvidia-dlss-4-tested-ray-reconstruction-upgrades-deliver-radical-enhancements\">Read more</a></p>",

I do seem to remember a lot more than other people, though - small things that when I bring up to those involved, I'm looked at as if I've fabricated the world's most mundane story. \"I had a really wonderful brownie there,\" I'll say to my wife as we pass a restaurant we last visited 12 years ago. \"I had lasagne and cheesy garlic bread,\" I add as she looks at me in a way that is clearly questioning if we've even set foot in the building before. It appears that I'm like this with games, too, a landslide of the past hitting me as I learned my mum's house, my childhood home, is going on the market this week.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/is-your-childhood-home-where-most-of-your-favourite-gaming-memories-are-found-what-a-strange-feeling-it-is-when-its-no-longer-yours\">Read more</a></",
