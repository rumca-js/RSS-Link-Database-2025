While Django Ninja supports async out of the box and looks very developer-friendly, we\u2019re concerned about its long-term support and community size compared to DRF. Future-proofing our app is important since this API will be a core part of our project.</p> <p>For those who have used Django Ninja in production, would you recommend it? What are your experiences with its stability and scalability?</p> <p>If not Django Ninja, how would you approach incorporating async functionality into a DRF-based API? Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! We will definitely use Celery for some tasks but rn we&#39;re looking for a solution for immediate responses.</p> <p>Thanks in advan",
