The chancellor has found herself in the spotlight as debt interest costs spiralled, while consumer and business confidence fell.

London\u2019s Trullo, about to celebrate its 15th birthday, shows us the way</p><p>One of the great blessings of my life is that I live only a 10-minute walk from one of the best local restaurants in London (perhaps <em>the </em>best Italian restaurant). Admittedly, its reputation, ongoing greatness and \u2013 here\u2019s the real marvel \u2013 fairly priced menu mean it\u2019s sometimes tricky to bag a table, even if you\u2019re a faithful, polite and grateful (grovelling) local like me; if one mark of an ideal neighbourhood restaurant has to do with spontaneity, then I suppose in this sense, it\u2019s not entirely perfect.</p><p>But still, its existence seems like a kind of miracle to me, even as it prepares to celebrate its 15th birthday. The luck of it! Just to walk by it on the scurry from the station to my door induces a rising sense of happiness.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/25/its-time-to-give-your-favourite-neighbourhood-restaurant-some-lov",

Photographer <a href=\"https://kazuakikoseki.com/pg96.html\">Kazuaki Koseki</a> has attempted to capture the phenomenon in his Summer Faeries series, compiled over a period of eight years. \u201cThe spectacle of fireflies flying through the summer forest is like the twinkling of a starry sky,\u201d says Koseki. \u201cThat sight is fantastic enough to forget the awe of the night forest.\u201d In recent years, the fireflies\u2019 habitat has been increasingly endangered by deforestation and the tourism industry. \u201cThe unpredictability of the fireflies\u2019 trails of light highlights the urgency of our planet\u2019s climate crisis, while at the same time holding a strong and enduring hope for the future.\u201d</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instagram.com/isseycraft\">See more on Instagram at isseycraft</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/jan/25/",

This was not because of a power outage, but because its owner switched it off. For an explanation of why it did so, though, we have to spool back a bit. For years, TikTok has been a thorn in the sides of US legislators and national security officials for two reasons. First, it\u2019s owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, which doubtless does whatever Xi Jinping tells it to do. Second, TikTok hoovers up phenomenally detailed data about its young users. The average session lasts 11 minutes and the video length is about 25 seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s 26 \u2018episodes\u2019 per session,\u201d <a href=\"https://medium.com/@profgalloway/tiktok-boom-c47b017bdaad\">says blogger ",

He\u2019s in the gym most mornings at 6am, cranking out 40-50km a week on the treadmill, doing conditioning work or lifting weights, before meticulously recording his workouts in training diaries \u2013 just as he did during his golden heyday. Even at 68 he is still chasing a fresh ambition: securing the most powerful job in global sport.</p><p>\u201cI will work harder for this than I\u2019ll probably ever work for anything,\u201d Coe insisted in December when he launched his manifesto to be the next president of the International Olympic Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s the dance that I just couldn\u2019t sit out.\u201d That dance, however, is about to get a lot more frenetic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/25/inside-race-biggest-job-in-sport-can-sebastian-coe-win-ioc-presidency\">C",
