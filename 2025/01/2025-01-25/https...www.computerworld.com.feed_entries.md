<p>Not to be outdone by its close rival OpenAI, Meta has announced its plans to spend $60 to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and is building a data center almost as big as Manhattan.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/">Facebook post</a>, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced his company’s intent to build a 2GW data center, bring roughly 1GW of compute online in 2025, and end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. </p>



<p>Included in his post was a blueprint of the planned “Richland Parish Center Data Center” superimposed on a map of Manhattan (the data center will actually be in northeast Louisiana).</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice this week announced that it had indicted two North Korean nationals and three other men, accusing them of participating in a conspiracy designed to trick US companies into funding the North Korean regime.</p>



<p>According to the indictment, which was filed in federal court in Miami, the scheme leveraged stolen identity documents and paid henchmen in the US to direct well-paid IT work and company computers to two North Korean men, Jin Sung-Il and Pak Jin-Song. The idea, the Justice Department said, was to funnel money back to the North Korean regime, which has limited opportunities to generate cash through legal means thanks to heavy international sanctions.</p>
