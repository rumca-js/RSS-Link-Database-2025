<p>Dominic Preston, writing for The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347690/oppo-find-n5-oneplus-open-2-thinnest-usb-c-ipx9">Oppo’s Next Foldable Is About as Thin as USB-C Allows”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oppo has been steadily teasing the Find N5 on Chinese social
network Weibo for the past week. Find series product manager Zhou
Yibao has now <a href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/Pako9ofOQ">shared photos</a> that highlight its size,
adding that the obstacle to making it any thinner is now “the
limit of the charging port.” [...]</p>

<p>The company claims the Find N5 is the thinnest foldable yet. That
title is currently held by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24235231/honor-magic-v3-thin-foldable-europe-launch">Honor Magic V3</a>, which is
4.35mm thick when open, meaning the Find N5 must be close to 4mm.
That explains why it looks about half the size of the 8.25mm
iPhone 16 Pro Max it’s shown next to in the photos. For reference,

<p>Jessica Lessin, writing for The Information back in 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ms. Vorrath, who has worked on all seven iOS releases, generally
operates by asking lots of questions of engineers, sticking to the
facts and getting them to explain in plain English why a
particular feature should be included in the operating system.
She’s easy to get along with, say former colleagues, who recall
playfully mocking her 1990s feathered hairstyle and late 1980s
fashion sense. But she isn’t known for chitchat and has been known
to “blow up” on occasion when people miss deadlines or make
excuses, colleagues say.</p>

<p>During a tense time before the first release of iOS software in
2007, Ms. Vorrath grew irate when a colleague was heading home
early before another marathon weekend meeting. She slammed her
office door so hard that the door knob broke, and she locked
herself in. Mr. Forstall grabbed a baseball bat to try to break
her out, people who worked at Apple at the time recall. Mr.

<p>Mark Gurman has an interesting scoop at Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for
fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to
market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and
Siri into shape.</p>

<p>Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was
moved to Apple’s artificial intelligence and machine learning
division this week, according to people with knowledge of the
matter. She’ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the change
hasn’t been announced publicly. [...]</p>

<p>Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple’s
biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead
project management for the original iPhone software group and get
the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw
project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems,
before taking on the Vision Pro software
