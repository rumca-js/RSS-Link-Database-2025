        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I see lots of good reviews about these KVMs on here and so I recently purchased a Sipeed NanoKVM PCIe POE version. I was going to plug it into a free PCIe x1 slot I have on my board. But I also wanted to remote power on the machine, but I don&#39;t think power is available via PCIe while the main machine is off? Since it&#39;s POE, I figured I might want to power it over Ethernet. If I power it via POE, will that conflict with PCIe power or should I just install it on a slot that doesn&#39;t have a PCIe slot so the gold finger is just dangling? Or does it not matter and I can do both? What about USB power?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/misosoup7\"> /u/misosoup7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i9bzgz/sipeed_nanokvm_pcie_gold_finger_and_remote_power/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i9b",
