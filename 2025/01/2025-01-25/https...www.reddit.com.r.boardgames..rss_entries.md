<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My friends are really into Magic The Gathering. I enjoy playing it, but don&#39;t really have time or interest outside of play sessions to read up on cards, buy more, figure out a good synergy between cards, to build a good deck. Probably more honestly though, I doubt I have the skill or brain capacity to make a good deck anyways.</p> <p>I heard about keyforge by the guy who designed MtG as a game that is designed to be collectible, but decks can&#39;t really be changed, you just play the deck as given out if the package. I find that really exciting and thought about buying some decks. Then I found out that the game doesn&#39;t seem to be popular with stores due to some distributer kerfuffle and now it might be turning into a dead game.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m debating if I should try this game, or something else that fits what I&#39;m looking for. I&#39;ve heard other similar games are Solforge and Radlands.</p> <p>Hoping to get some advice and insight.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I recently purchased Frostpunk: TBG because I absolutely loved the video game, however, I am having some confusion on a few particular things when it comes to playing solo.</p> <p>1: The Round Tracker has 15 spaces, and the instructions for the Action Phase say that I can only make one Action per Round. Does this mean that I will only ever get to play 15 total actions in a game? (IF I survive all 15, that is) I understand the game is extremely difficult, but that seems extreme even for what I&#39;ve heard. </p> <p>2: What&#39;s the point of having a high population if I can only make one Action per turn? I will only ever use 1 Meeple, and maybe a few will be used up by cards but having anything above 2-3 workers and 1 engineer seems like a massive waste of food and housing costs if you can&#39;t do anything with them. </p> <p>3: If I am playing with four people do we each get to make one Action during the Action Phase, or do we all ha

The ones where you battle eachother, and each card has some stats underneath the card with att/def/...). I don&#39;t think it was from a popular brand or anything, since I can&#39;t seem to recall any characters out of it. I do remember it was very spacethemed, and as far as I can remember every card was holographic/lenticular printed. So not the holo like pokemon cards, but the whole card had this ribbled texture and the character on it moved when rotating the card (more like jumped from one position into another)</p> <p>As far as I remember, the design of the cards was also kids themed.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My girlfriend and I are disagreeing on how to interpret the rules. </p> <p>The two cards involved are retrofit (instant) and envoy (continuous).</p> <p>Retrofit: Choose 1 of your uncovered cards in any theater. Gain supplies in that theater equal to the chosen cards strength. Then, flip the card.</p> <p>Envoy: After you play a card in an adjacent theater, you may move this card so that it covers that card.</p> <p>Envoy was face down and she played retrofit. She then used it to flip Envoy face up and resolve the effect of retrofit. </p> <p>She thinks that she can now use Envoys ability and move it to be on top of Retrofit because it is still after retrofit has been played.</p> <p>I argue that because Envoy wasn&#39;t face up at the time of playing retrofit, it&#39;s effect cant be used and ongoing effects must be face up to be used. </p> <p>Would appreciate a ruling on this.</p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;
