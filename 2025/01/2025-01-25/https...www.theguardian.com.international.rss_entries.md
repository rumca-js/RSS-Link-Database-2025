In footage from that day, an armed man dragged the barefoot and bleeding soldier out of the back of a Jeep on to a street in Gaza. Her arms were tied behind her back and blood pooled in the seat of her pajamas. Onlookers cheered at her distress.</p><p>For months, the women of Levy’s all-female surveillance unit – <em>tatzpitaniyot – </em>had noticed unusual practice raids and drills taking place on the other side of the fence, but their reports and warnings were ignored by commanders.

<p>The teenage prodigy who scooped his way into national consciousness on Boxing Day has a lot to prove on Australia’s upcoming tour and beyond</p><p>If you’re Sam Konstas, you’re used to things moving quickly. It took 718 first-class runs to get into the Australian team. It took 113 Test runs to potentially change the way it is set up. For almost two years since Travis Head won a shootout in India, the plan has been clear: on the next ragging Asian pitch, the usual No 5 would skip up the order, opening the batting to target rare overs of seam or to smack spinners using a harder ball. Usman Khawaja would partner him with graft, the veteran regular opener bridging the gap after David Warner’s retirement.</p><p>A few weeks before Australia’s imminent series in Sri Lanka, though, that plan was turned upside down. Konstas is also an opener. Konstas is also in the squad. On the momentum of the moment, Konstas is going to play. So either Khawaja moves down the order for the first time in y

In this version, the fish is oven-baked, adorned with crispy, chewy bits of garlic and ginger, and served swimming in a pool of salty-sweet kecap manis. Eating a whole fish from head to tail ensures a good start and finish to lunar new year, and represents abundance, wealth and prosperity.

<p>The Eternal City’s monuments and museums are busy at the best of times, but there remain myriad treasures to explore that are well off the beaten track </p><p>One of the earliest European printed books was a tourist guide to Rome. Ranging from information on ancient ruins, fallen temples and classical bathhouses to the place where an emperor “saw a vision in the sky”, <em>Mirabilia Urbis Romae</em> (Marvels of the City of Rome) was written in Latin in the early 12th century. The popular text was reproduced in dozens of manuscripts and was printed and published in the mid-1470s, a mere two decades after the Gutenberg Bible. As with many a menu in modern-day Rome, English, French, German and Italian versions were available.</p><p>Later, the Grand Tour brought throngs to the Eternal City of monuments and museums. Beguiled by its beauty, its mixture of terracotta and mocha colours, the galleries of renaissance sculpture and dark chapels full of old masters, many thought it a heaven on

<p>The country’s most controversial politician, Michael Lowry, is the cornerstone of the coalition.

To pull a stroke meant wiping the other fellow’s eye, by fair means or foul. The art might involve anything from “brown envelope” bribes and “nod-n-wink” sneaky deals to a type of sophisticated chicanery by outwardly unsophisticated politicians, known as “cute hoorism”.

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> The Past Lives and September 5 actor leads a beautifully made, if slightly too withholding, road-trip drama</p><p>Omaha, Cole Webley’s debut film from a screenplay by Robert Machoian (The Killing of Two Lovers), is very much a product of the Sundance film festival, both literally – the duo first connected here – and, for better and occasionally for worse, in tone. Spare, elegiac, quiet but affecting, this John Magaro-led character study is, fittingly, filmed and mostly set in the festival’s home state (for now) of Utah. It’s a tense family drama that mostly keeps its cards close to the chest and an ode, at least visually, to the liminal, fragile states one can enter on the road in the American west.</p><p>The bedsheets are still warm and the dawn light still pale when Ella, played by remarkable newcomer Molly Belle Wright, and her younger brother Charlie (a charming Wyatt Solis) pile into the car at the behest of their tight-lipped father (
