<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am almost finished with this and it is such a tragic and terrifying book. Though the story may be Orwellian, it reminds me so much of The Diary of Anne Frank. The writing is very subtle and the omission of names and specific locations beautifully mirrors the theme of disappearances, as does the protagonist‚Äôs manuscript. The violence of rape and murder is captured without cliche or overtly descriptive language. I am curious as to what others thought about the book, and I would love suggestions for similar books by female authors. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant-Pen-4928"> /u/Brilliant-Pen-4928 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i9uk14/the_memory_police/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i9uk14/the_memory_police/">[comments]</a></span>

I really like Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles and want to suggest it to him.

Over the last 6-10 months, I‚Äôve become the most irritable and easily agitated that i‚Äôve ever been in my life. I used to be a very patient father to my kids and partner to my wife but over the course of parenthood that trait has started to diminish. I find it hard to keep my cool nowadays and as a result im not the best parent or partner. I often become short with my wife because I am stressed out all the time. </p> <p>As far as anxiety goes, I don‚Äôt have a TON of anxiety but I do get nervous/anxious before silly or mundane tasks or even activities that I know I enjoy.

How she must have gathered the courage to cross into China border then take an international flight, talk to immigration officers. How she must have missed the people she left behind and who died while adjusting to the new life.

I was pretty shocked to find kobo has a few books 75% off, including a newer book i had purchased a few weeks ago full price. Other book topics were: native American history, revolutionary russia, black history, cold war history, and understanding the signs of facism. It made me wonder if some authors/publishers are also feeling the winds shifting... I&#39;m really nervous for the rewritten history my daughter might learn in school. I see people are now journaling/documenting whats going on now.... but what topics are you preserving for your own power in knowledge?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RepresentativeSky867"> /u/RepresentativeSky867 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i9b3j8/expanding_historical_knowledge_in_case_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span
