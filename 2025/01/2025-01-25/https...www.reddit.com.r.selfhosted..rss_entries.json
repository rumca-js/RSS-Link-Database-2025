I was wondering if anyone might know of a selfhosted solution for a business card scanner that could scan a business card for the name, position, phone number, email, and (if possible) company name for a business card? I get about 200 business cards a month that I have to input into a spreadsheet to keep track of and I&#39;d really love a way to take some of the personal work out of it. </p> <p>I&#39;ve done some searches on reddit but most of what I&#39;ve found is pretty old and not particularly useful. I&#39;ve also done some searches on github, but I&#39;ve run into more of the same issue. Alternatively, if there&#39;s a non-selfhosted option someone could recommend I&#39;d even take that at this point.

From what I&#39;ve gathered, some people prefer proxmox for the ease with which they can spin up vms and containers, and how easy and reliable the back up functionality is. Debian running containers on the other hand takes a lot more tinkering. It&#39;s possible to set up back up functionality like with proxmox, but it&#39;s more hands on at the start. The thing is, I LIKE the tinkering and configuring of the system. I worry that if I opt for proxmox at the start of this journey, much of what&#39;s driving the server functionality will be abstracted away and I won&#39;t understand it as well. I want to understand it before making it easy. Given my objectives, am I thinking in the right direction, or am I totally ",

I originally had a mini pc as a Server but upgraded to a &quot;real&quot; Server now. I want to run Proxmox on it but im unsure of how to use it. I got 1x 64GB m.2 ssd (from the Steam Deck) and 2x HDDs (1x 10TB, 1x 18TB). Is the 64GB enough for a Proxmox OS? Or should I get a bigger one because of VM images. Talking about them, like I said originally I just installed Ubuntu on my Mini PC with docker and all that stuff. How do I do this in Proxmox now? Do I create a VM or Container (I dont really know the diffrence) and install Ubuntu on there with docker and all. Or do I create a new VM for every docker Image I wanna install?</p> <p>Please if someone has a good guide for getting Proxmox up and running, I would love to see it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Space_v2\"> /u/Space_v2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

After few weeks I wipe this external HDD and I do copy all over again. So if something will go wrong with my server I do have access to my files on USB. This is not backup. On top of it I have real backups.</p> <p>Question: how to improve this copying task to make same files synced on my USB HDD?</p> <p>I was thinking about rsync, but, does it work one or both ways? I mean, if I remove or change file on external USB then rsync will update that change on server side changing my original file on server? If so then I cannot use rsync, but if there is command to make it one way sync only then it would be best option, I think.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fabulous-Ball4198\"> /u/Fabulous-Ball4198 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i9rptu/efficient_way_to_make_additional_copy_o",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I have several machines that backup to a remote server (on a different office). Currently I&#39;m using tailscale and SyncBackPro, but I get speeds of about 10-20 MB per second, which is very low considering both locations are connected to the internet using 10 gigabit fiber and the backup server is connected at 10Gigabit (the other location has 5 computers connected using gigabit ethernet). Speedtesting the connections gives me about 700MB / second speed both ways. I think the problem is probably Tailscale, so I was looking for a better solution. It would be very appreciated if anyone could give me some pointers. And yes, I realize hard drives don&#39;t support these speeds, and Gigabit lan has a maximum speed of around 80MB/second, but even then the speed should be well over the 10-20MB I&#39;m getting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Boring_Internet_9934\"> /u/Boring_Internet_9934",
