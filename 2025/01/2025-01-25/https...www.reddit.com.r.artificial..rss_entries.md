<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The key technical contribution here is using reinforcement learning with a novel &quot;Long Chain-of-Thought&quot; training approach to improve language model reasoning. The method carefully breaks down complex tasks into smaller steps while maintaining context across longer sequences.</p> <p>Main technical points: • Combines supervised pretraining with RL optimization using specialized prompts • Training happens in two phases - initial supervised learning followed by RL fine-tuning • Uses a dual reward model evaluating both final answers and intermediate reasoning steps • Implements gradient updates based on both immediate and delayed rewards</p> <p>Key results from the paper: • 20% improvement on complex reasoning benchmarks • Better performance maintenance across long sequences compared to baseline • More efficient training - achieved similar results with ~40% less training data • Consistent improvements across multiple reasoning task types</p> <p
