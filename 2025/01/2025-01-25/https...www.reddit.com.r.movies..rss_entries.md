<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve loved this movie a very long time &amp; this movie is what got me interested in Jake Gyllenhaal &amp; Paul Dano as actors. </p> <p>PLEASE - can we discuss Bob Taylor -did he escape Holly &amp; her pedo husband? &amp; what is with the mazes? How was he involved? How did he know the clothes? Why pigs blood? This part has always really confused me! I’ve rewatched so many times. </p> <p>Do you guys think Alex is challenged due to years of abuse? Also, Keller was SO valid bringing up the fact he shouldn’t drive with the mindset of a 10 year old, I really loved Detective Loki, but hate that he blew this off. He invested so much time into this &amp; didn’t bother looking further into Alex’s history? I feel like he would’ve found out he was kidnapped if he dug deeper. It’s crazy how he did not put two &amp; two together after talking with Alex’s real mother. ( I saw the thread about the pedo ring &amp; I thought it was interesting esp because they put n

## Emilia Perez and the lack of dialect coaches.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching “Emilia Perez” and I have to say, the lack of attention to the Spanish language in this production is absolutely disappointing. It’s baffling how a movie of this scale, with a cast full of internationally recognized actors, didn’t invest in proper dialect coaching. Mexican audiences, myself included, are extremely upset by how the film handles the Spanish language—or rather, “butchers” it. </p> <p>Selena Gomez doesn’t even attempt to explain or adjust her poor pronunciation. Then there’s Zoë Saldaña, whose character conveniently throws in a “Deus ex machina” explanation that she was born in the Dominican Republic to justify her accent. And Sofia Gascon? Her voice had to be AI generated because she couldn’t even sing the notes of the songs. </p> <p>It’s as if the production, being French, didn’t even bother to take the language seriously. The songs—written in French and awkwardly translated into Spanish—make little to no sense

## Indiana Jones was an homage to James Bond, so they cast Sean Connery as his father. What are other instances of homage casting?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was thinking about this. Spielberg and Lucas have long said that &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; was born from their desire to make a James Bond film, mixed with the 1930s action serials they also used to love. There&#39;s a bunch of James Bond castings in the Indiana Jones franchise - namely Sean Connery, but also Allison Doody and Julian Glover as well.</p> <p>Another example is &quot;Joker&quot; taking cues from DeNiro films &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;The King of Comedy,&quot; with them ultimately casting Robert DeNiro in their film as well.</p> <p>What other examples exist of this? A movie inspires another movie, so they cast folks from that first movie in this one. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whitepangolin"> /u/whitepangolin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i9vode/indiana_jones_was_an_homage_to_james_bond_so_they/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre

Even with all the arguing in the boat it just had a &quot;dont care&quot; attitude. Finally it hops off the boat and what my interpretation was it gave up on life.</p> <p>The cat made attempts (giving the fish for food), following it all the way. But that was not enough. </p> <p>Im just sad, I felt it represents the people that get hurt to a point they give up on life.</p> <p>My first viewing I thought the Crane sacrificed for everyone to stop the flood, but second viewing it changed, to a sadder interpretation.</p> <p>Anyone thought the same thing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tidus1117"> /u/Tidus1117 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We watched this after deciding to watch all the animation nominees we could. If it were to win, I wouldn&#39;t be too broken up about it. The film centers on fraternal twins as they find themselves separated by the government following the death of their father. The boy ends up with a cultish family and the girl ends up with a couple of childless swingers. It only gets weirder and darker from there. The themes are heavy, and you will find yourself crying in spots. The film deals with death and sexual deviance, and is most definitely not for kids, as I found myself having to explain what a feeding fetish was to our 13 yr old. Over a period of years, the twins get shit on all through life until their reunion. There are a couple of laughs scattered about, but it isn&#39;t supposed to be funny, the humor is very dry. The best character is Pinky, an old widow who befriends the girl, and she has lived quite a life. She brings some much needed levity during

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not necessarily who is the greatest or most accomplished. For example, whose death do you think would result in greatest global mourning? Personally, I think it&#39;s Ian McKellen. I think the world will be devasted when he passes. Watching RotK today and hearing him tell Pippin about death and White Shores made me misty eyed. May he enjoy many more years of good health! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/latticep"> /u/latticep </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i9ess7/who_is_the_most_beloved_living_actor/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i9ess7/who_is_the_most_beloved_living_actor/">[comments]</a></span>

## How much does the quality of a soundtrack impact your rating of a movie?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking, and I feel some of my favorite movies are ranked so high in my book because of their outstanding soundtracks. Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, The Good the Bad and the Ugly are some of my most favorite movies and all have stellar soundtracks. For me, even mediocre movies like Interstellar and Scarface get major bonus points because of their amazing soundtracks. Guys like Morricone, Zimmer, Williams, and Herrmann don&#39;t receive enough credit for how much they elevated the movies they composed for. I couldn&#39;t have been more ecstatic than when Morricone finally won an Oscar for Hateful Eight after so much brilliance. Anyone else feel this way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ultros03"> /u/ultros03 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i9a2fb/how_much_does_the_quality_of_a_soundtrack_impact/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="ht
