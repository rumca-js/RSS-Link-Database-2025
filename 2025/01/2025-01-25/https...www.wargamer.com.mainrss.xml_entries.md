Speaking in a D&amp;D YouTube video on January 23, Crawford and his colleague F.

								<p>The McDonald’s Pokémon crossover began on Tuesday, and already it looks like scalpers are on the prowl, securing whole boxes of these dragon-themed <strong>Pokémon cards</strong> and attempting to flip them on eBay at inflated prices.
