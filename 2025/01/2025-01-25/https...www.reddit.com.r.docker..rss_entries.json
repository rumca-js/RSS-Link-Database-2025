I&#39;m struggling to find any solid information on the best way to set a static IP to a container using docker compose.

Unfortunately I&#39;m in a situation where I need a static IP for my NGINX reverse proxy container ( currently 172.16.18.2 ). I have other containers that need to know the IP of the reverse proxy they will have their traffic routed through, and won&#39;t accept a hostname. </p> <p>The issue is, docker doesn&#39;t seem to have much regard for which containers have had static IPs assigned.

Sure there are lots on the Internet that gives you a free 7day trial or limits you to 5 notifications. Well I would like to host one myself with my docker server. I don&#39;t like to pay for services (pricey) that I can possible host myself. Does anyone know of a crypto price notification container. It just needs to text me when it hits the price. I wouldn&#39;t mind it sending to my Telegram account either or maybe it has a front end GUI that my crypto buddies could also use would be a bonus.</p> <p>I found a couple that didn&#39;t quite do this, and have fell out of updates, by like 7 years.</p> <p>NOTE: I use docker compose</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beam_Me_Up-NCC-1704D\"> /u/Beam_Me_Up-NCC-1704D </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1i9cbjm/cryptocurrency_notification_does_one_exist/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp",
