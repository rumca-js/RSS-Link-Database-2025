I&#39;ve been paying more attention than usual since it&#39;s almost Valentine&#39;s Day. He recently contemplated buying a Genesis II since his original doesn&#39;t have the third of the red yellow white plug thing (fine, I didn&#39;t pay great attention) and with a Genesis II, he could have stereo audio. </p> <p>My opinion is this is just to get another console. Is there some way to buy something cheaper that could make his OG Genesis &quot;sound&quot; like the G2? They aren&#39;t that much on eBay, but I&#39;d been thinking about plunking down for an Odyssey2 (<em>my</em> first console and one he&#39;s never played) and thought if there was a cheaper option for his Genesis, I&#39;d get two birds stoned at once.</p> <p>And yes, the Odyssey2 is partly for me, but it&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day. We&#39;d share. \ud83d\ude01</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

My fascination with the genre solidified when I saw the movie Tron. Since I recently acquired an Atari 2600 and learned how to use MAME, I think it&#39;s best to find new strategies and try approaching them more competitively.</p> <p>So, this leaves me with the question: what score does someone need to have to be considered &quot;good.&quot; We all know a score in the million range makes someone a master. But how many digits would it require for you to say &quot;master the game.&quot; Like, a 100,000? My highest score on, say, Asteroids is 10,000.
