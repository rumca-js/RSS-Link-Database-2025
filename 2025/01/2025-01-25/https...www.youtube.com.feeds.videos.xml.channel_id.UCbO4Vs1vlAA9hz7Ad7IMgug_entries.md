The ELDAR are back. Sad to see them go, but the old Metal Phoenix Lords and Aspects have finally come to the end of through journey as Games Workshop puts forth a whole new Aspect Warrior range alongside this 10th Edition Codex. Let's check it out!

Thanks to Games Workshop for the complimentary advance copy of the book and box to review.
