<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What is the most underated punk rock band in history? I say Death. Death was started in 1971 by three African American brothers from Detroit MI. The band cut an album in 1975 but faced a lot of discrimination in the music industry. True to many punk rock bands during the 1970s, the Hackney brothers refused to change the band&#39;s name just to get a record deal. Unfortunately, the group disbanded in 1977 but a small but growing cult followed had developed. So much so that, in 2009, a music exec got a hold of a copy of the 1975 album, played it on the radio and essentially brought Death back to life. One of the Hackney brothers, David, died in 2000 so he never got to see the band&#39;s dreams come true. Death was reformed. That 1975 album was finally released in 2009 and since that time, a few more albums dropped. My favorite Death song has to be &quot;Politicians In My Eye&quot;. Note that the music isn&#39;t funk, it&#39;s raw in-your-face punk rock

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There a bunch of 1 hit wonders, but I&#39;m curious about bands that have a solid background and good discography that hasn&#39;t been appreciated. Basically they have one really popular song that is recognizable by most, but actually have a good catalog of other music that&#39;s less known. </p> <p>For example, Blind Melon is mainly known for No Rain but their songs Change and Tones of Home are fantastic.</p> <p>*Edit I&#39;ve been told St. Anger was actually made by a band that had other great hits?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those of you who lived through it what was Michael Jackson&#39;s career like in the 2000s and what do you think it&#39;d be like if he lived to this day? As someone born in 2006 obviously I was unaware of who MJ was till after he died but the general consensus is that he was on top of the world in the late 70s through the mid 90s till his career and public image took a hit due to the allegations, he managed to rebuild himself and in 2003 it took yet another hit with the second allegations, he was acquitted in 2005 and passed in 2009 while trying to make a comeback. But unbiasedly what was his image and career like in the 2000s? With the rise of up and coming male rnb and hip hop artists like Usher, ginuwine, Justin Timberlake, chris brown etc where did MJ fit in to all this and how do you think it&#39;d pan out if he lived to this day?</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2xqwdrefb2fe1.jpg?width=1140&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e38986
