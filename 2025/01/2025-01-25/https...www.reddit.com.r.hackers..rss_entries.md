<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok. So a buddy of mine got out of federal prison and brought his commissary bought SanDisk Clip MP3 player with him. The thing about these MP3 Players is that the BOP buys them in bulk and farms them to a company called ATG (a-t-g.com). This company strips the factory firmware out and installs their own(when released, you can mail the MP3 to the company and they will reinstall factory software/firmware to mail back to you).</p> <p>You have to log into a prisons secure network in order to download music. For years inmates have been trying to crack these things using smart phones snuggled into the prisons. Mostly Androids. Eventually it was discovered that you could download an app called OTG Pro and using an OTG cable, you could finally add music to it yourself. This is the only app that ever worked. Unfortunately that&#39;s all it would do. It won&#39;t let you remove music. </p> <p>Now I figure the reason no one in prison could crack these things is
