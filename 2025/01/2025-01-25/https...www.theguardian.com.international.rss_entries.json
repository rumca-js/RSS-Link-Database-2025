        "description": "<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> The Past Lives and September 5 actor leads a beautifully made, if slightly too withholding, road-trip drama</p><p>Omaha, Cole Webley\u2019s debut film from a screenplay by Robert Machoian (The Killing of Two Lovers), is very much a product of the Sundance film festival, both literally \u2013 the duo first connected here \u2013 and, for better and occasionally for worse, in tone. Spare, elegiac, quiet but affecting, this John Magaro-led character study is, fittingly, filmed and mostly set in the festival\u2019s home state (for now) of Utah. It\u2019s a tense family drama that mostly keeps its cards close to the chest and an ode, at least visually, to the liminal, fragile states one can enter on the road in the American west.</p><p>The bedsheets are still warm and the dawn light still pale when Ella, played by remarkable newcomer Molly Belle Wright, and her younger brother Charlie (a charming Wyatt Solis) pile into the car at the behest of their tight-lipped father (",

She cowered on the dirt floor as giant boulders flew past the kitchen from the hillside above, sending a rock the size of a small car crashing through the thatched roof of one house, narrowly missing the bed where her grandmother slept. When it was over, the landslide had gouged a huge scar through their property, and Hawel heard the cries: \u201cMummy, mummy.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled outside to find her son Samuel, 3, buried up to his chin in rubble. She and her niece Kendra, 8, dug him out; when she clutched him to her, he miraculously had only a few scratches on his back.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/25/vanuatu-earthquake-december-2024-port-vila-feature\">Continue re",
