<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I used to be hugely active on Usenet in the early to late 1990s, in various discussion groups in the alt tree. </p> <p>Binary downloads were a thing, but it wasn&#39;t <em>the</em> thing, especially on a 14.4kbps modem.</p> <p>A couple of questions as someone wanting to get back into it:<br/> 1. Is there any data on how active actual discussion groups still are on Usenet?<br/> 2. Are there providers around that focus on indexing/retaining conversation heavy groups? A lot of the service providers now seem to focus on binary data transfer and retention for binary groups, to the point they don&#39;t even really advertise the discussion groups. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sinisterpisces"> /u/sinisterpisces </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9w7ou/usenet_for_discussions_in_2025/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’ve been wondering about the difference between torrents and Usenet. Both seem like ways to download stuff, but I’ve noticed a lot of people go with Usenet even though you have to pay for it.</p> <p>So what’s the deal? Is Usenet really that much better? Is it about faster speeds, better privacy, or something else?</p> <p>I’ve given it a shot, but I just don’t get why it’s better than torrents. Honestly, it feels pretty expensive.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eaglestarx"> /u/eaglestarx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9kbjs/whats_the_difference_between_torrents_and_usenet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9kbjs/whats_the_difference_between_torrents_and_usenet/">[comments]</a></span>
