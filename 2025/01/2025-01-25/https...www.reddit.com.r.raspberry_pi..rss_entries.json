My goal is to control the flight controller and exchange data via the GPIO pins (RX/TX) on the Raspberry Pi.</p> <p>The flight controller itself works perfectly: I can configure it via USB in Betaflight, the motors run, and the sensors respond. The GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi have been tested and seem fine. The wiring has been redone and tested multiple times. The Raspberry Pi recognizes the ports /dev/serial0 and /dev/ttyS0, and I\u2019ve made all relevant changes to the config.txt and cmdline.txt files (e.g., enable_uart=1 and dtoverlay=uart2 for GPIO8/10).</p> <p>The issue is that I cannot establish any communication. When I test the serial connection with picocom or screen, the terminal opens, but I can neither type anything nor receive a response. The ports are not blocked (c",
