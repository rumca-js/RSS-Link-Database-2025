Is there any data on how active actual discussion groups still are on Usenet?<br/> 2. Are there providers around that focus on indexing/retaining conversation heavy groups? A lot of the service providers now seem to focus on binary data transfer and retention for binary groups, to the point they don&#39;t even really advertise the discussion groups. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sinisterpisces\"> /u/sinisterpisces </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9w7ou/usenet_for_discussions_in_2025/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet",

Both seem like ways to download stuff, but I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people go with Usenet even though you have to pay for it.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the deal? Is Usenet really that much better? Is it about faster speeds, better privacy, or something else?</p> <p>I\u2019ve given it a shot, but I just don\u2019t get why it\u2019s better than torrents. Honestly, it feels pretty expensive.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/eaglestarx\"> /u/eaglestarx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9kbjs/whats_the_difference_between_torrents_and_usenet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i9kbjs/whats_the_difference_between_torrents_and_usenet/\">[comments]</a></span>",
