It&#39;s an old server with an Intel Xeon E5-1607 v3 and a Geforce GT 730. I, over the course of several hours of troubleshooting, got the server to run. I flashed bios on the motherboard (an ASUS Z10PA-U8 for those interested), enabled XMP, boosted the struggling 2 core cpu, and installed Ubuntu. As a reward for my efforts he allowed for me to install steam onto the computer to try and run a view games for shiggles using Proton and Vulkan. GTA V, Helldivers 2, CS2, ect.</p> <p>The problem im facing here is that Ubuntu cant run Proton or Vulkan because the graphics driver installed dont support Vulkan. That wouldn&#39;t be bad if it wasn&#39;t that the last drivers released that support the GT 730 is Nvidia Graphics Driver 390, as the graphics card is a legacy card.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to play TF2 and CS2 on my new to me computer. I got a workstation from 2011 and upgraded a bit of the specs, now I have a GTX 750 ti, i7-870 and 32gb of ddr3. I know that isn&#39;t too good however that should still be able to run TF2 and cs2 quite easily right? My problem comes from the vulkan shaders. it takes about 3-4 hours to compile them, so I figured I might as well just deal with it and went on my day. Got back, files all compiled, could play TF2. finish playing, power down my computer and then don&#39;t get on for a few more days. Today just tried to get on and I got stuck with the same exact screen. I absolutely do not want to wait for 3 hours every time I want to play TF2, would rather be doing something else with my life. Does anyone have any fixes to this?? CS2 has been an even bigger headache, but I dont mind as im fine just playing tf2. FYI I am on linux mint as I dont want to buy windows, but TF2 natively works on linux so

I have maintained an install of battle.net launcher via steam&#39;s Proton version 8.0.5 that worked last time I played it.

So I did a little digging and found out that I needed the latest Proton GE because that fixed an issue in the battle.net launcher. However, even after updating when I attempt to launch Diablo IV I&#39;m getting Fenris error dialog box and the game doesn&#39;t start.

## Need help with FO4

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been trying to run FO4 and it keeps crashing on New Game. It&#39;ll display the load icon graphic in the bottom right corner for about 10 seconds and then it crashes to desktop. I&#39;ve tried just about every fix I have been able to look up and actually &quot;successfully&quot; do. Not to the point of actually starting the game, but at least following instructions that should have fixed this issue. I&#39;m at my wits end. I&#39;m running dra460nized Garuda on a Dell Optiplex 9010. It runs most everything else on Steam or otherwise really well, just can&#39;t seem to get FO4 to start a New Game. Please help. Specs in comments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/haloumisogood"> /u/haloumisogood </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i9elrm/need_help_with_fo4/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i9elrm/need_h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have you heard about stop killing games initiative ? Its an initiative to change the EU regulation in order to stop the practice of disabling the games when publisher stops supporting.</p> <p>If this initiative goes ahead then publishers need to left the game in a working state before shutting down support. In other words, the game keeps working without a connection to company servers being required.</p> <p>For more details:</p> <p><a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com">https://www.stopkillinggames.com</a></p> <p><strong>Its needed 1 million signatures by june and we have so far 400k.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently tried nobara, bazzite, endeavor os.</p> <p>I&#39;m using 2 monitors. One of them displays correctly while the other is just 1024 x 768 resolution (goes all the way up to 1600x900 on endeavour) I don&#39;t know WHY this is happening or of any fixes however, if I uninstall the drivers, it detects everything just fine. My monitor name, refresh rate and resolution are all good! But when I have the drivers installed NOPE!</p> <p>And even more frustrating it&#39;s my gaming monitor literally the monitor I use for all my games that this is ONLY affecting not my secondary screen. Both are using Display port signals and my gpu is a Ventus 2X RTX 3060 TI OC model. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone help me please I just remade the change from windows to linux again. But if I can&#39;t fix it I guess I have to go back. </p> <p>My NORMAL monitor resolution is 2560 x 1080 (wide-screen 1080p) and it has 200 hertz </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm
