The game is simple and timeless, with one block falling at a time. There are a few basic shapes, like L-blocks, squares, and z-shaped squiggles, and the player must interlock the pieces together until rows fill the screen horizontally, which clears them, making room for more bricks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has",
