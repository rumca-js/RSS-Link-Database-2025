The audio part got me investigating and I *may* be able to move my audio producing environment to linux with some wine magic and an extra tool. Stuff like this makes me happy. Srsly, this guy is no joke, hands down one of the best animators of his kind from that era and a great one when it comes to style.</p> <p>Also he&#39;s switching to davinci resolve, oh, and most importantly, to THE PENGUIN OS.

Just wondering when I can expect pmOS working? Apparently not even the Pixel 6 series works fully, and I feel like it has something to do with the Google&#39;s SoCs in here. I know my GPU isn&#39;t even supported by panfrost yet so it will take a while. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MicherReditor\"> /u/MicherReditor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1htvokd/linux_for_new_pixels_when/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1htvokd/linux_for_new_pixels_when/\">[comments]</a></span>",

To expound on the above question:</p> <p>Windows 10 is losing support soon and I don&#39;t really like what I&#39;ve seen of Windows 11.
