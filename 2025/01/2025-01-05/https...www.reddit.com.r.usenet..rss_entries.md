<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I used Usenet 15–20 years ago, and it was an awesome time—lots of new movies, TV shows, comic books, and music! Back then, there were a few good NZB indexers, and I used AltBinz to fetch files from Usenet.</p> <p>I’m curious about the current status of Usenet: 1. Do I need to pay for access to NZB indexers? 2. Which Usenet provider would you recommend, especially in terms of retention? 3. What kind of content is typically available on Usenet these days?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pTomic"> /u/pTomic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hujgfu/what_can_be_found_on_usenet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hujgfu/what_can_be_found_on_usenet/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wanted to get some feedback on which providers to add. I currently have Frugal Usenet and Eweka (Netnews, <a href="http://Usenet.Farm">Usenet.Farm</a>, Omnicron), but I&#39;m thinking of not renewing Eweka b/c of how little it&#39;s grabbing compared to Frugal.</p> <p>Option 1: Add NewsgroupDirect (UsenetExpress, Uzo Reto, Usenet.Farm) and gain UsenetExpress and Uzo Reto.</p> <p>Option 2: Add TheCubeNet and Usenight and gain UsenetExpress and Abavia.</p> <p>So the way I see it (backbone wise) the main questions are which is better, Abavia or Uzo Reto? And is the UsenetExpress better retention in <a href="http://Usenet.Farm">Usenet.Farm</a> and UsenetExpress really beneficial?</p> <p>Thank you for any input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nnyan"> /u/Nnyan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hue6i7/provider_mix_recommendation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a
