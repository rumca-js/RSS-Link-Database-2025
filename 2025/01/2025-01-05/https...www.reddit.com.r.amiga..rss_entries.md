<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the proud owner of an A500 with a GVP Impact 40Mb hard drive with 2Mb of RAM in it. An extra 0.5 Mb in the trap door. My question is, is it possible to accelerate this while still using the 2Mb RAM in the GVP? What are the best solutions? I remember GVP did one of these with a 68030 in it but I&#39;d guess they can&#39;t be converted one to the other. I&#39;m digging playing original Civilization and messing around on Workbench but by Christ it doesn&#39;t run fast.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Deep-Capital-9308"> /u/Deep-Capital-9308 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hu0hhx/a500gvp_impactaccelerator/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hu0hhx/a500gvp_impactaccelerator/">[comments]</a></span>
