Some of them are by design like the Ferengi are obviously a caricature of conservative ideology from the perspective of Roddenberry who was of course making Star Trek to have the future of humanity be this communist utopia so he was trying to make them his contemptible image of villainy (but unintentionally made the most charismatic and interesting bunch of the whole franchise, when watching old ds9 episodes I usually just focus on the ones where quark and nog were the main characters). But what about other things like ogres and goblins and witches and wizards and vampires and werewolves and dragons and leprechauns? Well no doubt leprechauns and dragons would be libertarians because they&#39;re gold nuts.

I thought Szeth and Kaladin&#39;s scenes were particularly interesting, as well as learning more about the history of Roshar in the Spiritual Realm.</p> <p>However, Sanderson&#39;s worst tendencies are also on display here in a larger way than in previous books. The modern, YA casual language the characters use is becoming more and more prevalent. There are jokes about poop, about a sprens (nonexistent) genitals, and cringey dialogue and banter that will make your eyes roll out of their sockets.

I&#39;d love to revisit it after this time, especially since I only remember fragments and can&#39;t quite remember the title. </p> <p>What I know is that at the start there is a protagonist boy, who lives in a village that gets attacked or burned and he has to escape. I seem to remember there was a girl he knew in the village and some sort of mysterious house at the beginning. Eventually he went on to look for some mythical sword/weapon. I think he got progressively more powerful with time and in the second book he went or was sent to another desolate desert realm, there were also some dragons later on.</p> <p>AI suggested me it might be the Belgariad but I&#39;ve read the first half and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.</p> <p>I&#39;d be very grateful for any suggestions or help from you guys!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",

It was fine - I did not thing it was as amazing as a lot of people think, but I enjoyed it overall. There were some great characters and interesting worldbuilding (I liked the insect-people and some of the descriptions of rituals especially), alongside some one-dimensional villains and worldbuilding I thought was a bit poorly thought out. I was intrigued enough to pick up the next book in the series.</p> <p>Enter Kevin. I hate Kevin with a passion. And his appearance kicked the Orientalism in the story into overdrive. The first book had a little in it - the people are a bit too obsessed with honour and follow the rules and hierarchies of their society a bit too unquestioningly to really make sens",

Loth says \u201cI hope you are not suggesting that Queen Rosarian was ever unfaithful to Prince Wilstan.\u201d - referencing Sabran&#39;s mother and father. </p> <p>This is the first mention of Sabran&#39;s father&#39;s name. And then a little while later, Kit says &quot;I say we weather the next few weeks, find poor old Prince Wilstan if we can possibly manage it.&quot; </p> <p>I scoured everything up to this point and there is no mention that I can find that Sabran&#39;s father, Prince Wilstan, is missing??? </p> <p>Is this just the first mention of it? Entirely without context? Is he in Yscalin? Since when? Literally nothing has been mentioned about him thus far and n",

I&#39;m back with another review, and this time, I\u2019m diving into a genre I haven\u2019t explored much since childhood: urban fantasy. It\u2019s a realm of fiction I\u2019ve often struggled to connect with, though I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why. But hey, it\u2019s always good to try something new! </p> <p>Today, I\u2019m sharing my thoughts on <em>The Sanhedrin Chronicles</em>, a fresh urban fantasy novel that hit the shelves this past November. I was fortunate enough to receive an ARC (Advanced Reader Copy) around its release, but between the whirlwind of the holidays, battling a nasty bout of illness, and juggling work, I haven\u2019t had a chance to put pen to paper\u2014until now. Better late than never, right? So, how does <em>The Sanhedrin Chronicles</em> measure up? Let\u2019s dive into the blurb and find out!
