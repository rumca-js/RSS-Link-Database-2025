The curtains don\u2019t fully block out all sunlight and it was left near a window so i\u2019m paranoid it might have inflicted some damage to my quest 3, but due to my inexperience with VR headsets I really can\u2019t tell if its degraded or not. Could some help me out identifying if there\u2019s anything wrong with my headset? I know is a bit of a silly question since if there\u2019s anything wrong with it i\u2019d be able to tell right away but it still bothers me knowing I left it near a window.

I own a gaming laptop, and have tried playing games like Half Life Alyx on it, and believe it or not, it worked fine. My Quest 2 used Virtual Desktop air link, NOT with cable, and I played the game, nearly finished it, and it runs smoothly. There are 2 second jitters every 10 minutes or so, but other than that, the graphics, the FPS: is fine. I wanted to buy a new game, Contractors Showdown, which I have on my Quest, but I want to see the better graphics, and since Half Life Alyx worked perfectly fine, I wanted to know if this game would work. I use ethernet for my laptop, and air link Virtual Desktop, will playing it work?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Otherwise-Fall-4227\"> /u/Otherwise-Fall-4227 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hu8a5e/is_my_pc_ready/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",

It\u2019s game changing. When I used it years ago it was on a much older system that was barely capable of anything and I put it aside and forgot about it. My only problem is that it\u2019s quite blurry/pixelated and I can\u2019t read any of the dials or any other text unless it\u2019s massive. I was thinking of upgrading the headset to suit the new system and did look at the vive pro 2 and some others, but I\u2019ve come across the quest 3 and it looks like it fits all the boxes, plus I can use it away from the PC etc. Plus the price tag is great. </p> <p>I guess my question is, will I notice a big jump between (what I think is) the original HTC Vive and the quest 3 in terms of picture quality, readability, immersion ect. </p> <p>If the tech hasn\u2019t come that far and it\u2019s still blurry and illegible I won\u2019t bother. </p> <p>I\u2019m happy to take adv",
