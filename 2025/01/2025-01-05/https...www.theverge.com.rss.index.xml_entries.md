  <p id="yhCugB">Targus-owned Hyper introduced the HyperSpace Trackpad Pro, a premium haptic trackpad for Windows, on Sunday. The company plans to add basic compatibility with macOS via a firmware update later this year.</p>
<p id="2jfiTQ">Like the Magic Trackpad does on a Mac and other precision trackpads do on Windows laptops, the wireless HyperSpace Trackpad Pro supports multitouch gestures. However, Hyper’s trackpad software grants Windows users an advanced level of customizability, with the ability to set up shortcuts in the trackpad’s corners. That includes general functions like copying and pasting but also specific actions within apps like Adobe Suite, Figma, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. </p>

  <p id="fv84qb">At least when it comes to making TVs, LG can seemingly do no wrong. Year after year, the company’s OLED sets are at the top of most reviewers’ recommendation lists. They’ve overcome the Achilles heel of older models — brightness — thanks to clever innovations like Micro Lens Array, which made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/2/23535050/lg-2023-oled-evo-g3-c3-tvs-announced-features">the G3</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24023584/lg-2024-oled-tv-lineup-m4-g4-c4-b4-features-specs">last year’s G4</a> bright enough to make HDR shine in any viewing environment.</p>
<p id="z4KAm7">So it should come as no surprise that LG’s 2025 lineup of OLED TVs ra

  <p id="GIPN2g">Belkin has announced the Stage PowerGrip, a magnetic battery pack that doubles as a DSLR-style ergonomic grip for iPhone photography, a phone stand, and a spare wired charger for your other devices. It’ll be available in May, with pricing info coming later on. </p>
<p id="KYodFm">The PowerGrip is an odd-looking accessory until you see it attached to a phone. It’s clearly designed to evoke the look and feel of a traditional camera. It features Bluetooth pairing to enable the “shutter button” on the top of the grip to let you take pictures with the iOS camera app.</p>
