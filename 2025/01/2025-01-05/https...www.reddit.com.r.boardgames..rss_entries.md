I love that game, although crap at it. Is there such a thing as a boardgame version of that?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This can be a general Kemet discussion thread, though I really wanted to ask the community&#39;s opinion on three things.</p> <p>1) How long does the game tend to last for you guys? The box says 90 minutes, which is of course a total lie, but it seems like many groups online can easily knock it out in two to three hours even at the full 5 players. I am wondering if my groups are doing something wrong because it takes easily four hours if not up to five, and that&#39;s playing with multiple different groups. Granted, there are usually at least one or two new people who need a teach and time to get acclimated, but this still seems like a pretty egregious time compared to what I am seeing online.</p> <p>2) How do you guys feel about the endgame? Kemet is a stellar experience in my opinion, but the endgame is pretty weak due to a pretty extensive session of bash the leader that seems to happen at the end of most games. After someone hits 9 points, there

As I understand it, the three “flavor effects” are Concentration (also called “body,” red tokens), Preservation (also called “acidity,” green tokens), and Dispersion (also called “aroma,” blue tokens). These effects are activated, and must be carried out, any time you play one of the colored tokens into the “cup effects” section of the board. My question, do you have to carry out a flavor effect when you play a colored token into the “immediate effects” section? For example, the immediate effect at the top of the board is “two additional tokens,” and it takes one red token to activate. Does that also mean that I have to carry out “concen

I am interested in getting the expansions for added replayability and so that I can save on shipping costs but am just worried about how well-integrated they are considering they were developed with base Nemesis in mind.</p> <p>I’ve played base Nemesis quite a lot online and enjoyed it, however, it’s quite difficult to find a copy of it that isn’t outrageously priced from where I’m from. I heard that Lockdown follows a very similar play pattern as base Nemesis and I can get it for basically half the cost so I decided to pursue that instead.</p> <p>Lastly, how would you rate the expansions in terms of importance, Voidseeders, Carnomorphs, Lockdown Stretch Goals, and the others?

Anyway, Tried to play it a handful of times now, 2 player, and I feel like we just must be misunderstanding something. The time clock is so punishing, and we don&#39;t know how you can possibly win all 3 fights in the beginner scenario before time runs out, little lone how you are expected to get through what I can only assume are longer scenarios later in the campaign.</p> <p>Is this a common feeling people have with the game, or are we probably missing something drastic here? Sometimes you draw &quot;time goes forward 2 squares and another 3 unless both players discard or bury most of the cards they have left&quot; and its just over, but even drawing favourable time cards it feels like a bit much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ulong2
