I have been doing some research and it seems like bazzite OS would be the one for me but I think it&#39;s much better with AMD hardware? My main goal for the device would be setting up emudeck/emulation station so I can take it out and about and play classic couch co op games with mates. I would need it to be able to run run up to PS2/Gamecube games well but I am not bothered about upscaling. I am hoping to find a preowned or refurb one relatively cheap, if anyone can give me any pointers that would be much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MFDennis12"> /u/MFDennis12 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hublnq/what_to_look_for_in_a_laptop_to_use_bazzite_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.re

When I was still using Windows, I had the setting set to Auto, and when I started a game, the TV would automatically switch to Game Mode (it didn&#39;t work 100% of the time, but about 90% of the time).<br/> However, on Linux, the auto-switch feature doesn&#39;t work. I have to manually enable Game Mode. My assumption is that there might be some information in the HDMI signal that tells the TV a game is being displayed, prompting it to switch to Game Mode. I don&#39;t own a console, but based on my research, it seems that consoles also trigger this automatic switch to Game Mode.<br/> I have been searching for possible solutions or ways to address this problem, but I haven&#39;t found anything so far.<br/> Perhaps someone could point me in the right direction.

I&#39;ve tried multiple times but to no avail. I found out that Proton Experimental restores the cutscenes, but they made it sound like they were all fully repaired when instead of that there is audio crackling, out of sync audio, missing music, and some cutscenes were also very slow. I don&#39;t remember this being like that when I tried the command process mentioned in the link I provided, and I want to try and make that happen again despite it looking unlikely to do unless I reimage SteamOS, and I don&#39;t wanna do that again, man.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently upgraded from a 1080ti to a 7900xtx. I have two monitors (one 1080p and the other 4k) that go through two HDMI switches, which plug into a laptop and a PC. Since both the 1080ti and the 7900xtx only had 1 HDMI port, I make the 1080p monitor go through the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09X9ZN3LR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1">Display Port adapter</a>. This set up worked fine for the 1080ti, but now with the 7900xtx the monitor that gets plugged in through the adapter flickers and has weird artifacting. I tried removing the HDMI switch and just having the monitor plug into the PC with the adapter to remove one layer of indirection, but there is still flicker. </p> <p>Is there anything I can do to fix this that doesn&#39;t involve buying an expensive dock? </p> <p><code>Linux Mint Wilma</code><br/> <code>OpenGL version string: 4.6 (Compatibility Profile) Mesa 24.0.9-0ubuntu0.3</code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &

## After switching to Linux Mint, games have a strange red ghosting/tearing effect when it gets dark.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title suggests, whenever a game with a night cycle gets darker, the screen seems to have more red pixelation than usual and when something is animated on screen (such as player movement, npc movement, etc) there is a strong ghosting effect (not sure if I&#39;m using that term right- basically, there is an after-image that fades behind whatever has moved, making gaming extremely nauseating at times).</p> <p>This problem was happening to my boyfriend a while back but I was able to fix it on his computer by changing his graphics driver&#39;s color format to limited RGB.
