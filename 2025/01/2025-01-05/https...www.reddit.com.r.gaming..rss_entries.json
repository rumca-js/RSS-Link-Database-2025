Something like SD Gundam Battle Alliance, but not chibi and with more in depth story, weather the story is unique or not. I&#39;ve always thought if they could make an Amored Core style game, but with Gundam, it would be amazing. The AC games scratch the itch a little, but not entirely. I&#39;ve played lots of older Gundam games but none really stood out to me, let alone anyone else enough to make it a bigger video game franchise. </p> <p>The same could be said for Zoids.

I&#39;d be looking at the Steam Page of something the like of EUIV or CK3, and immediately be thinking &#39;holy shit, I&#39;d take decades to learn this&#39; and while the thought of that is actually kinda cool, I feel like those two examples specifically, make Civ 6 look like childs play.
