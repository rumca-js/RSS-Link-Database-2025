<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m having trouble getting home assistant OS going on my raspi5 using the 52pi ssd adapter(m.2 nvme ssd adapter- bottom n07) When I load raspbian os on the SD card and boot the pi my network sees the pi and I can ssh into it and use vnc to work with it. With the ssd installed and lsblk command I cannot see any additional drives besides the SD 32gig. I’m using the official pi5 power supply. When I added a second ssd to try another ssd, I got a light to come ON on the 52pi adapter. But no light with the first drive. Regardless I cannot see either ssd. Is this a power issue, driver issue, or 52pi adapter issue? Any ideas or commands I can try to get more info on what is going on? Appreciate any support. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FLEAL76"> /u/FLEAL76 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hufc55/pi5_with_52pi_ssd_adapter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>

Additionally I tried installing steam through wine64 and the same issue occurs. Through both processes it stops when there&#39;s 100mb left of the update and gives that error. </p> <p>Additionally, I tried getting doom 3 from pi apps and when I run the app nothing happens. </p> <p>I would appreciate your advice with any of these issues.
