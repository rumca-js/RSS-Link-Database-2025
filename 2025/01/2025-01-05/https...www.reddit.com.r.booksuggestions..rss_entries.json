        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>Pretty much what the title says. Several years ago I discovered Matthew Reilly and his Scarecrow series. He was the first author where I absolutely couldn\u2019t put the book down. It seemed like every chapter ended in a cliff hanger, and I found my self so hooked into what was happening that on multiple occasions I broke my promise to \u201cread just one more chapter\u201d. I\u2019m not someone that goes through books quickly or just depends an afternoon reading so this was a new experience for me. I haven\u2019t really for anyone like that since, but I\u2019m a big fan of writers like Michael Crichton and David Baldacci. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated </p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/V1p3r7\"> /u/V1p3r7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1huf2bs/suggestions_for_booksauthors_where_you_just_cant/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ww",

Looking to stock up my TBR pile, and since I started using StoryGraph last year, I\u2019ve noticed i like the books that are rated that \u201cflaws of characters a main focus\u201d as \u201cNO\u201d significantly more than when it is the main focus of the book. I haven\u2019t found a way to find books by this feature, and simply using the filters of \u201cplot driven\u201d and trying to find similar books to those I\u2019ve like has not been fruitful. Tbh, I love StoryGraph, but I don\u2019t feel like their personalized recommendations are very good. I\u2019ve also tried using Libby and Goodreads to find \u201csimilar\u201d without much luck too. Sometimes I find one or two, but not enough to really build a good TBR. </p> <p>To highlight, I was browsing this sub/reddit for books, and Red Rising is one I see consistently recommended, so I read the preview on Libby. The plot was interesting and makes me want to read it, but I already couldn\u2019t stand the main character and could tell his flaws were going to be",

But I was reading a single mom book with the FMC reconciling with her child&#39;s dad and it triggered me a lot. I both hate and love single mom recs. Because I&#39;m the child in the scenario as I was raised by one and it&#39;s always a trigger for me but since I&#39;m a masochist I end up reading it again and again. This time the trigger was really bad. So basically I need a little reverse of the single mom trope to sooth my bruised heart and my abandonment issues. </p> <p>Basically what I want is for the FMC to be raised by her single mom growing up angry and resenting her dad. Only for her dad to find her years later and she learns from him he never knew of her existence until a now. Her mother always taught her lover knew but left them but the dad never knew and now that he does he starts doing everything he can to reconcile with the FMC and her mom. The MMCs can be anyone but bonus if he is close to FMC&#39;s",

I highly recommend it, as it distills important nuggets of information from the books into digestible summaries.</p> <p>Especially if you&#39;re a book lover and do not find time for paperback reading; this is an excellent alternative, it can eliminate the unnecessary fluff.

I have loved watching Strike and Robin&#39;s relationship grow and the thrill of fighting for what is good and right. I devoured the audiobooks for all of them and began desperately searching for this thing I&#39;ve been missing so much in my life - literary escape. </p> <p>But I can&#39;t seem to find something to move on to and I fear my momentum will die. </p> <p>I&#39;ve historically loved fantasy, sci fi, historical fiction.

But I want to try books that are like suspenseful and full of twists.

For reference i could not get through many very popular series but just finished a 26 vol light novel. Im looking for a high fantasy setting with romance mixed in. I would prefer the whole series to be no longer than 1200 pages with fast pacing in the start. The whole series does not have to be fast paced but I need to be invested before I can enjoy the slower parts. I hate slow-burn romance that is constantly interrupted but i really value good realistic dialogue. 2 really big pluses for me is an immersive world and good good character development (even if that does not make them better people, i just like to see change). I also love a deep plot but i hate when things get out of hand and they just keep adding mysteries without solving the old ones. Finally i dont mind a cliche ending but if it\u2019s a bad ending i dont even want to waste my time. </p> </d",

The issue is, I struggle to finish series because I can\u2019t linger on something that long! I prefer stand alone books so I can love the book and move on instead of dreading reading; essentially because I know there\u2019s more I should read and the guilt of bouncing to other books when I still want to finish the series but just can\u2019t get myself to do it, really bugs me. If this makes sense, is there recs for books similar to the acotr series but just stand alones?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bubbasheep\"> /u/bubbasheep </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1htsz1n/stand_alone_standin/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1htsz1n/stand_alone_standin/\">[comments]</a></span>",
