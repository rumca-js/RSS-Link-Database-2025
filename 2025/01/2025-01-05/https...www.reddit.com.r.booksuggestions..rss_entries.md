<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found this quote on a Instagram post writing on a book but I couldn&#39;t find where it&#39;s from :</p> <p>You can&#39;t skip chapters, that&#39;s not how life works. You have to read every line, meet every character. You won&#39;t enjoy all of it.Hell, some chapters will make you cry for weeks. You will read things you don&#39;t want to read, you will have moments when you don&#39;t want the pages to end. But you have to keep going.Stories keep the world revolving. Live yours, don&#39;t miss out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Addendum434"> /u/No-Addendum434 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1huk8jt/where_is_this_quote_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1huk8jt/where_is_this_quote_from/">[comments]</a></span>

One book has been on my mind lately, though I don’t remember much of it, nor whether it was good. Here’s what I do remember: </p> <p>There was a kid who had a power that they couldn’t control. The power was that anything that made them angry had something bad happen to it - like an instant bout of bad luck for that person or thing when the main character expressed negative feelings for that thing. I believe that the main character was trying to fight it and not cause any harm, but I’m not sure. The scene that sticks in my mind was (I think) towards the end of the book, when his family forced him or her to go somewhere against his will, and while he was in the back seat, he looked at the hat the mom was wearing and thought, “I always hated that hat.” The next thing that happened was a car crash, and I believe the mother was killed O

I want a book I can finish, set down, and be unable to talk or form any thoughts for the next few minutes. A book that can <strong>make me laugh, tear up, and look at life a little differently</strong>. </p> <p>For reference, these are some books I&#39;ve read and feel like hit this category:</p> <ul> <li><em>A Man Called Ove</em> by Fredrik Backman</li> <li><em>Britt-Marie Was Here</em> by Fredrik Backman</li> <li><em>Everything I Never Told You</em> by Celeste Ng</li> <li><em>When Breath Becomes Air</em> by Paul Kalanithi</li> <li><em>Rise and Shine, Benedict Stone</em> by Phaedra Patrick</li> <li><em>How High We Go in the Dark</em> by Sequoia

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>Pretty much what the title says. Several years ago I discovered Matthew Reilly and his Scarecrow series. He was the first author where I absolutely couldn’t put the book down. It seemed like every chapter ended in a cliff hanger, and I found my self so hooked into what was happening that on multiple occasions I broke my promise to “read just one more chapter”. I’m not someone that goes through books quickly or just depends an afternoon reading so this was a new experience for me. I haven’t really for anyone like that since, but I’m a big fan of writers like Michael Crichton and David Baldacci. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated </p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/V1p3r7"> /u/V1p3r7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1huf2bs/suggestions_for_booksauthors_where_you_just_cant/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://ww

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! Looking to stock up my TBR pile, and since I started using StoryGraph last year, I’ve noticed i like the books that are rated that “flaws of characters a main focus” as “NO” significantly more than when it is the main focus of the book. I haven’t found a way to find books by this feature, and simply using the filters of “plot driven” and trying to find similar books to those I’ve like has not been fruitful. Tbh, I love StoryGraph, but I don’t feel like their personalized recommendations are very good. I’ve also tried using Libby and Goodreads to find “similar” without much luck too. Sometimes I find one or two, but not enough to really build a good TBR. </p> <p>To highlight, I was browsing this sub/reddit for books, and Red Rising is one I see consistently recommended, so I read the preview on Libby. The plot was interesting and makes me want to read it, but I already couldn’t stand the main character and could tell his flaws were going to be

It doesn’t have to have a happy ending or sugarcoat things, but I want there to be at least some display of hope or happiness. I really liked Station Eleven, and A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet.

I both hate and love single mom recs. Because I&#39;m the child in the scenario as I was raised by one and it&#39;s always a trigger for me but since I&#39;m a masochist I end up reading it again and again. This time the trigger was really bad. So basically I need a little reverse of the single mom trope to sooth my bruised heart and my abandonment issues. </p> <p>Basically what I want is for the FMC to be raised by her single mom growing up angry and resenting her dad. Only for her dad to find her years later and she learns from him he never knew of her existence until a now. Her mother always taught her lover knew but left them but the dad never knew and now that he does he starts doing everything he can to reconcile with the FMC and her mom. The MMCs can be anyone but bonus if he is close to FMC&#39;s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been getting into Headway apps lately, and I can confidently say that this has been one of my best decisions for book reading.</p> <p>It provides a 15-minute summary of the nonfiction and self-help books. I highly recommend it, as it distills important nuggets of information from the books into digestible summaries.</p> <p>Especially if you&#39;re a book lover and do not find time for paperback reading; this is an excellent alternative, it can eliminate the unnecessary fluff. But sometimes some crucial bigger part of the book might be missing. The major drawback, I feel, is there isn&#39;t much variety in the books, and should introduce fictional ones too. And also should tailor books based on our ratings and preferences.</p> <p>My only question here is - Does anyone have any suggestions for reading specific sections of books in Headway that could provide a greater advantage compared to the usual paperback?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im very picky with my books and don’t read often but if i like a book enough i can read it forever. For reference i could not get through many very popular series but just finished a 26 vol light novel. Im looking for a high fantasy setting with romance mixed in. I would prefer the whole series to be no longer than 1200 pages with fast pacing in the start. The whole series does not have to be fast paced but I need to be invested before I can enjoy the slower parts. I hate slow-burn romance that is constantly interrupted but i really value good realistic dialogue. 2 really big pluses for me is an immersive world and good good character development (even if that does not make them better people, i just like to see change). I also love a deep plot but i hate when things get out of hand and they just keep adding mysteries without solving the old ones. Finally i dont mind a cliche ending but if it’s a bad ending i dont even want to waste my time. </p> </d

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, ACOTR series. I very much like the books, especially the second one. The issue is, I struggle to finish series because I can’t linger on something that long! I prefer stand alone books so I can love the book and move on instead of dreading reading; essentially because I know there’s more I should read and the guilt of bouncing to other books when I still want to finish the series but just can’t get myself to do it, really bugs me. If this makes sense, is there recs for books similar to the acotr series but just stand alones?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bubbasheep"> /u/bubbasheep </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1htsz1n/stand_alone_standin/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1htsz1n/stand_alone_standin/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So over the past year as I have become more independent in life (22/M), I think ive fallen into the productivity hole on social media.
