The Orchard Keeper I didn\u2019t read, but listened to it as it was included in my Audible subscription. Really because I figured if I was going to sacrifice one of his books to an audiobook experience I might as well choose the least regarded of his bibliography. I\u2019ve read Blood Meridian and and listened to it many times through. </p> <p>The first important thing that I learned was from Blood Meridian. I was reading through getting frustrated with the vocabulary, at having to stop and look up so many words, mostly geographical terms, and it dawned on me that I was racing. I just wanted the book under my belt. So, I slowed down and made sure I got it, his rhythm, his vocabulary, and once I did this the book became very visual and beautiful, even with its graphic nature. So I learned to read slow from that book. Lesson: It\u2019s not a race. </p> ",

I lived in that world and knew it&#39;s geography better than my own countrys. But going back to them as an adult they are awful. The writing is pretty poor, they are soooo repetitive, and there&#39;s no escaping that book 1 was obviously a huge LOTR ripoff. But maybe the worst thing is that every single novel follows the same damn formula. Band of scrappy heroes tasked with a quest to travel some geographic distance to fight the new big bad or retrieve the new macguffin. Rinse and repeat for twenty books. </p> <p>Brandon Sanderson isn&#39;t perfect but reading him lately has helped me get back into fantasy that actually has other plot structures. Or reading Monk and Robot series which doesn&#39;t even HAVE a plot hardly but was a delightful little slice of life novella pair. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/diceblue\"> /u/diceblue </a",
