It has certain &quot;cartoonishly macabre&quot; tone to it and &quot;the snobbish high society is dumb&quot; social commentary, both of which are pretty typical in Burton&#39;s movies. It helps that the movie to this day stands-out from the rest of Zemeckis&#39; filmography, which is more known for fun adventures and grounded dramas, so it never comes to my mind first, when thinking about his movies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CrazyFinnishdude"> /u/CrazyFinnishdude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hu9mqt/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_best_a_wellknown/">[link]</a></span> &

Here are some of the elements I love about it, to help with matching:</p> <p>-The atmosphere of like 1930s mob gangsters, jazz music, big city, almost noir-like feel to it.</p> <p>-Pulling off a great balance of being both fun and sincere (Stanley Ipkiss is the best of both worlds Jim Carrey).</p> <p>-Good believable performances by side characters like Cameron Diaz, whoever plays Dorian Tyrell, and even the annoying detective character.</p> <p>Anyway, I could keep rambling on, but hopefully you get the idea. I&#39;m sure theres nothing quite the same, but if anything comes to mind that matches this style that I could enjoy as an adult, I&#39;d love to hear it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FloridaMan_90"> /u/FloridaMan_90 </a> <br

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We often talk about localization of movies in foreign markets when it comes to weird title changes, but that&#39;s only the most visible form of localization when translating movies to other languages. The whole point of localization isn&#39;t to just translate everything, it&#39;s to make the product understandable, non-controversial, and entertaining to foreign cultures, which doesn&#39;t always work with a purely faithful translation, so changes are often made to the dialogue and plot.</p> <p>For example, in Inside Out Riley doesn&#39;t like broccoli, a common trope with Western children, but in Japan this was changed to bell peppers, which is a more common disliked food trope in Japan. They even changed the animation for those particular scenes.</p> <p>A common one we often hear about is when a movie has gay characters. Foreign markets will often change the dialogue where it is stated that a character is gay, and if there&#39;s a scene of them ki

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Background : I understand many people are not fans of her work (I’d say a third just aren’t interested, another third think it’s all style and no substance, and the final third dislikes her because of her Twitter presence, therefore has no interest in her work)</p> <p>I find her directive eye beautiful and the cringe, stilted dialogue in her movies seemed purposeful to me - reminiscent of similar movies of the 60s and 70s her two most prominent films set out to embody. But now that I’m a few chapters into her book… I’m questioning things. </p> <p>I’d just like to say that there are times STYLE BUT NO SUBSTANCE works with movies but I cant say there is zero substance to her movies, the feminist messaging being pretty straight forward to me. </p> <p>But this book though….Im sorry but its so poorly written, and now its making me question if the stilted dialogue I enjoy so much in her films wasn’t purposeful, and is actually just .. her being a bad write

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Name the best lesser-known/lesser-discussed twist ending movie (or a common one just left off the list below). The general &quot;best twist&quot; question has been asked several times I know, so what&#39;s out there that hasn&#39;t been named a hundred times. And yes, before someone says it, I know being told a movie has a twist ending kind of ruins the surprise of twist ending. I get it. Anyway. What are some that are not on the list below. Debatable if some of these count as twist endings, just listing the ones people name a lot. Post edited cause the list below was originally covered as spoilers but it&#39;s annoying to click them all individually in a list this long, so if you don&#39;t want to know what movies have twist endings you should probably stop reading:</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <p>.</p> <ul> <li>Shutter Island</li> <li>The sixth sense</li> <li>the others</li> <li>fight club</li> <li>oldboy</li> <li>No way out</li> <li>the
