A recent Chromium patch hints at a standalone floating panel, offering seamless integration with Windows 10 and 11. This could position Gemini Live as a serious competitor to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot.</p> <p>Gemini Live is built for real-time, natural conversations, providing context-aware answers. While currently limited to Android and iOS, this development suggests a broader rollout is on the horizon. The floating interface could make Gemini Live a more flexible and accessible tool, untethered from browser windows.</p> <p>The integration of Gemini Live into Chrome for desktop aligns with Google\u2019s broader vision of making AI a central part of our lives. Expect tight connections to Gmail, Android, and other Google services, ensuring a cohesive experience for users.</p> <p>However, this leap isn\u2019t without challenges. Concerns",

Google should offer a subscription plan where users can access specific features at a lower cost. Why should I pay for their 2TB storage plan when I don\u2019t need it? On mobile too, I only like the advanced deep research feature. Google should create options where users can subscribe to individual services instead of forcing them to buy an expensive bundle.
