<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m super new to using an RSS feed reader and it&#39;s been a huge boost in my ability to read full articles and remain organized. </p> <p>I have started following some friends&#39; substacks (etc) through the reader, but I don&#39;t subscribe because I don&#39;t want to receive emails. Would they receive more support somehow (like more accurate analytics I guess for potential freelance or jobs I guess IDK) if I was actually subscribed even under a free plan? </p> <p>Same for independent journalists etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ConcreteForms"> /u/ConcreteForms </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1htvt8e/is_it_more_supportive_of_writersjournalists_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1htvt8e/is_it_more_supportive_of_writersjournalists_to/">[comments]</a></span>
