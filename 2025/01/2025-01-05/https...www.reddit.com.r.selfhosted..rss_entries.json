Ideally it should be lightweight, support the usual necessary things like DKIM, authenticate clients either via LDAP (I use lldap as a server) or have its user entries in a file format I can easily generate through automation (like nix).<br/> I don&#39;t need to receive emails, have a web interface or anything. Supporting multiple email domains would be nice, but not really necessary.</p> <p>Maybe anyone here has a nice idea how to solve that.

I have an Unraid home server and I want a solution to easily store files that I can access from my PC, my laptop (on any network), and my phone (on any network), not require a VPN to access files, be able to share files with others, organize photos in a photos folder but have them all viewable through Immich, and have all the photos I take on my phone instantly backed up to the photos folder.</p> <p>Initially I figured the solution was NextCloud with Immich. I loved the customizability of NextCloud, I connected it to my own domain via a Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel and branded it with my own logo and everything, and I figured I&#39;d host my photos in NextCloud and use the external directories feature of Immich. I actually used the external sites app to add an Immich link in NextCloud, and I love the easy and streamlined mobile and desktop apps, it seemed like the perfect solution.</p> <p",
