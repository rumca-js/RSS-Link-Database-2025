With the ssd installed and lsblk command I cannot see any additional drives besides the SD 32gig. I\u2019m using the official pi5 power supply. When I added a second ssd to try another ssd, I got a light to come ON on the 52pi adapter. But no light with the first drive. Regardless I cannot see either ssd. Is this a power issue, driver issue, or 52pi adapter issue? Any ideas or commands I can try to get more info on what is going on? Appreciate any support.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, im facing with an issue with old sharp lcd 55&#39; (6 years old tv) and latest libreelec, osmc (i&#39;ve tried both - neither worked) on rpi4. The problem is if i use the latest version of this distro&#39;s i don&#39;t have a signal on TV. If i use older version (osmc 2021.08-1) everything works fine, so i digged some little and i think I&#39;ve managed to locate an issue - it&#39;s kernel. Newest versions are using kernel above 5.10.32-1 (that kernel works on my TV). Everything above this version = no signal. </p> <p>tried using many video modes like this: vc4-fkms-v3d : i have picture, but no sound and CEC;</p> <p>vc4-kms-v3d : completely no signal</p> <p>I dont want to change a TV...

I&#39;m not familiar with Linux much so I apologize for any rookie mistakes. </p> <p>I installed pi apps to install box 86, box 64, and wine64 to help install some apps. Steam unfortunately opens up and when downloading a mandatory update it stops mid way and says I&#39;m not connected to the Internet (I&#39;ve tried multiple networks). Additionally I tried installing steam through wine64 and the same issue occurs. Through both processes it stops when there&#39;s 100mb left of the update and gives that error. </p> <p>Additionally, I tried getting doom 3 from pi apps and when I run the app nothing happens. </p> <p>I would appreciate your advice with any of these issues. If there&#39;s a more appropriate place to submit this question please let me know. </p> <p>Thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/toxic_cloud\"> /u/toxic_cloud </a> <br/> <",
