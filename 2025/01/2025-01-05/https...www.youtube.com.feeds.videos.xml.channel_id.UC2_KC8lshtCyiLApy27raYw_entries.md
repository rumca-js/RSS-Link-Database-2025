About 2 years ago, I made this video about AI art and how I felt it was on the verge of destroying art itself or something. Very existential, very somber. But in the time since I’ve made that video, I’ve realized that maybe I was duped.

Maybe this technology isn’t all powerful, all capable, and maybe there are limitations that technological progress can’t solve.

Maybe this is destined to just make funny clips on the internet.

So today, I’m gonna take a look back at what’s happened, what I think will happen, and why ultimately AI art isn’t going to replace humans.
