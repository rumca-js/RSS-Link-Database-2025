<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to have a really good book light that I had gotten from Barnes &amp; Noble. But, it unfortunately broke/quit working. I went back to my local store and they don&#39;t sell that model anymore. I tried getting a different one, but I don&#39;t like it. The style I had before had one of the clips that&#39;s like a bag clip and the new one is like a paperclip style. I read a lot of paperbacks and the paperclip style is crumpling the pages.</p> <p>What book light would you recommend? I&#39;m looking for one that has more of a yellowish light as well and not a led white light.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/panthersrule1"> /u/panthersrule1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hugfsu/what_book_light_would_you_reommend/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hugfsu/what_book_light_would_you_reommend/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In my readings of Cormac MacCarthy the two books I learned the most from are The Orchard Keeper and Blood Meridian. The Orchard Keeper I didn’t read, but listened to it as it was included in my Audible subscription. Really because I figured if I was going to sacrifice one of his books to an audiobook experience I might as well choose the least regarded of his bibliography. I’ve read Blood Meridian and and listened to it many times through. </p> <p>The first important thing that I learned was from Blood Meridian. I was reading through getting frustrated with the vocabulary, at having to stop and look up so many words, mostly geographical terms, and it dawned on me that I was racing. I just wanted the book under my belt. So, I slowed down and made sure I got it, his rhythm, his vocabulary, and once I did this the book became very visual and beautiful, even with its graphic nature. So I learned to read slow from that book. Lesson: It’s not a race. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished this and it’s the first book I’ve ever thrown across the room after finishing. It’s so bad. Is it just because it was published in the late 90s? I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt because of that but the fatphobia and faux feminism was awful. And don’t even get me started on the weird writing about Ireland. His accent was as creamy as the head of a pint of Guinness? Appalling. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Proud-Clock8454"> /u/Proud-Clock8454 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hudamp/venus_envy_by_louise_bagshawemensch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hudamp/venus_envy_by_louise_bagshawemensch/">[comments]</a></span>

## Books that you loved as a kid but hate as an adult?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I was a kid I devoured Terry Brooks whole Shanara series. I lived in that world and knew it&#39;s geography better than my own countrys. But going back to them as an adult they are awful. The writing is pretty poor, they are soooo repetitive, and there&#39;s no escaping that book 1 was obviously a huge LOTR ripoff. But maybe the worst thing is that every single novel follows the same damn formula. Band of scrappy heroes tasked with a quest to travel some geographic distance to fight the new big bad or retrieve the new macguffin. Rinse and repeat for twenty books. </p> <p>Brandon Sanderson isn&#39;t perfect but reading him lately has helped me get back into fantasy that actually has other plot structures. Or reading Monk and Robot series which doesn&#39;t even HAVE a plot hardly but was a delightful little slice of life novella pair. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/diceblue"> /u/diceblue </a

I’m pretty sure I really need to at least be FAR more open to being ok with the idea of “cheating” (with audiobooks).

## The Fall of Gondolin by J.R.R. Tolkien & Christopher Tolkien.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Finally excited to be here after a long break. Never read any books as well.</p> <p>The Fall of Gondolin is a pretty neat book. Christopher has done his best conveying what his father wanted. But, the problem I had was that it never felt like reading the books wrote by the OG Tolkien. There is something lacking in this and The Children of Húrin, that I can’t really point it out. Maybe, it’s just me because I know these books were released posthumously after Tolkien’s death.</p> <p>The book was pretty captivating and gives us some ideas of how Christopher came into bringing these draft works of Tolkien into full fledged novels. Wish J.R.R. Tolkien lived long enough to write to complete all the Middle-Earth books and lore. I am not complaining about Christopher though. Anything is better than nothing.</p> <p>I wish I knew I had to read The Silmarillion and the other predecessors of this book in its order. That way I wouldn’t be confused about some part

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don’t think this book is that amazing on its own. I haven’t read the second book but I feel like depending on how good that book is, it will change my opinion on the first. </p> <p>Everyone compares the book to dune and the name of the wind. But I think it’s really similar to Cormac McCarthy’s style. They both are written in a really similar style as if trying to paint a picture in your head instead of describing a scene as accurately as possible. </p> <p>But the issue I had, was that McCarthy’s prose are poetic while this book’s were purple. In blood meridian, (the only McCarthy book I read so far) the descriptions were genuinely stunning. I never felt as if I was reading the author write but as if some god of art was painting a picture in my mind with words. Empire of silence’s prose, while beautiful, feel forced and heavy handed at times. </p> <p>And I feel like the author keeps trying to give excuses for this by making the main character consta

## Let's talk about utopias

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s talk about utopias! I have read several utopias and rated them on two five-point scales. The first of them evaluates the quality of the book (plot, characters, etc.), the second – the difference of opinion between the characters. I believe that difference of opinion is a key quality for a good utopia. If all the characters are similar, it is much easier for them to avoid any conflicts. And if all of them are ideal (which happens in several utopias that I’ve read), then it is unclear what’s the point of the utopia at all. Ideal people would live in happiness, peace and harmony under a lot of regimes.</p> <p>(I&#39;m sorry for any mistakes – I’m not a native English speaker).</p> <p>Let&#39;s go!</p> <p> </p> <p>Edward Bellamy – Looking Backward: 2000–1887</p> <p>Book: 3.
