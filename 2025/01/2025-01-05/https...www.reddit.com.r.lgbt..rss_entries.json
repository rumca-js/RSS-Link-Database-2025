I keep hearing gay men use the exact same bigoted talking points that have been used against gay men for decades and they just don\u2019t get how ridiculous that is.</p> <p>I just want to live in a world where people live and let live. Why is that basic human principle so hard for humans? I don\u2019t have to understand other beliefs to accept them so long as they\u2019re not hurting anyone. </p> <p>Anyways, I just wanted to let people know that they\u2019re seen and loved. I want to sit at a table in life where there\u2019s a seat for everyone. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BennyTheWiseGuy\"> /u/BennyTheWiseGuy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1htvau1/i_will_always_support_my_trans_and_non_binary/",

It recently came to my attention that she is literally being cyberstalked by this disgusting bigot on YouTube. She is a good person and doesn&#39;t even have any personal ties to this guy, but he is harassing her and others and even talking about her children. I&#39;m going to post his YouTube channel link and am asking all of my sisters here to please support her by reporting as many of this guy&#39;s community posts and videos as possible, please. It&#39;s been over two years. YouTube has reinstated his page several times. I know this can\u2019t be good for her mental health, and she recently said her oldest daughter stumbled on his page because he constantly tags her.</p> <p>youtube.com/@1upunderground</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/P2R2DoX\"> /u/P2R2DoX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
