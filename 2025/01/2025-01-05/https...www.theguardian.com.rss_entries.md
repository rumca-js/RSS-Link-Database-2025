<p>Coiling ridiculous plot around a nauseating premise – babies swapped at birth, one of the parents is a hellish sociopath – makes for a hollow and unpleasant watch. This is the very worst of modern television</p><p>The brazenly ludicrous TV thriller has its place. Sometimes it’s fun to throw all logic and sense to the wind and surrender to a bananas plot whose twists and turns – which play out amid huge, aspirationally spotless homes and gorgeous vistas – are so entertaining and hilariously camp that you end up glued to the screen. Unfortunately, Playing Nice does not fit this mould. Yes, it’s a frantically tense drama, set in a beautiful location, that teems with preposterous coincidences and plot developments. But it is also a story about forcibly removing preschoolers from their parents and exposing them to potentially mortal danger at the hands of a disturbed sociopath. Which, you know, isn’t really my idea of a laugh.</p><p>Playing Nice – adapted by Grace Ofori-Attah (<a href=

<p>This distressing documentary looks back at the terrorist attacks of 7 July 2005 through the eyes of victims and first responders. Two decades on, they remain visibly traumatised</p><p>There was a lovely mood in London on the evening of 6 July 2005: like the heady fizz of a midsummer glass of champagne. The sun was out and the news was good. Earlier that day, the city had been announced as host of the 2012 Olympic Games. The streets and bars were buzzing. Martine Wright was among the people out celebrating. Accordingly, on the morning of 7 July, she was mildly hungover and making her way to work slightly later than usual.</p><p>She jumped on to a Circle Line train and remembers being surprised and delighted to get a seat. And then everything changed for ever. She has very few memories of the minutes and hours that followed the initial blast although she was, apparently, conscious for most of it. She seems to have blanked it out. She can only speculate: “Maybe my brain just decided

<p>An evening of some redemption for Manchester United was not without its customary agony at Anfield. Seconds remained of a gripping battle between the two old rivals when Joshua Zirkzee, taunted mercilessly by the Old Trafford faithful on Monday, found himself staring down at Alisson’s goal.</p><p>He spurned the shot at glory in favour of teeing up Harry Maguire, another maligned figure during United’s long fall from grace. He found Row Z of the Anfield Road Stand, and United’s wait for a first win at Liverpool in nine years goes on.

<p>Hamza Igamane’s hat-trick was not enough to secure victory for Rangers as Rocky Bushiri’s late header earned a dramatic 3-3 draw for in-form Hibernian. Gers looked on course to follow up their 3-0 demolition of Glasgow rivals Celtic on Thursday when Igamane put them 2-0 up early on.</p><p>But Hibs – who had lost just one of their previous eight matches – regained their composure after a fraught start and got themselves level with a double from Martin Boyle.

I take a picture of this, because it’s never happened before. When she was born, our initial concern was that he would be the one to act out, suspicious of a new interloper into the family unit. These fears were unfounded, as he immediately took to his little sister with delight, awed by her cuteness, treating her like a living doll he’d been given as a present.</p><p>She arrived bearing gifts, too, a brand new Lego fire station for him to play with. To this day, I don’t know what possessed her, at just a few hours old, to be so generous, nor how she had the faculties to source and pay for such an elaborate playset.

It didn’t deliver and they were punished accordingly. The Labour party, on the other hand, ran an election campaign designed to translate widespread disaffection with the Conservatives into the maximum number of votes by saying very little about what they would do about the pressing problems that would face them in government.

<p>A no-holds-barred account of the Vatican’s covert operations – from escape routes for Nazi war criminals to money laundering for the mafia<em> </em>– is revelatory but sometimes too dense for its own good</p><p>Popes used to control vast areas of Italy – the so-called “papal states”. But when the unification of Italy was finally completed after the capture of Rome in 1870, only about 120 acres of central Rome were left in papal possession. Popes railed against the Italian state until the Lateran Pacts were signed with Benito Mussolini in 1929, when each side recognised the other and the theocratic Vatican City was created.</p><p>With a population of 764, it’s the smallest sovereign state in the world. But its reach is global, guiding the lives of more than a billion Catholics. “The Vatican is one of a kind,” Yvonnick Denoël writes in this dense study, “because of its hybrid status: it is a micro-state and, at the same time, a worldwide spiritual authority.”</p> <a href="https://ww

<p>These innovative products, adding both moisture and colour, are here to save the day</p><p>When it comes to makeup, lip colour is key to completing any look. But let’s face it, traditional lipsticks often come with downsides, such as drying out lips and leaving them chapped. (And there’s nothing worse than a lipstick-chapped pout… except maybe lipstick on your teeth.) Thankfully, hydrating lipsticks are here to save the day. These innovative products are gamechangers, combining rich colour with nourishing ingredients to keep lips soft and moisturised. Not all lipsticks are created equal, though. The secret to hydration lies in the formula. Look for ingredients such as shea butter, vitamin E and natural oils for a smooth, vibrant finish. If your lips are especially dryand in need of extra moisture, go for products with hyaluronic acid and peptides – like Charlotte Tilbury’s Hyaluronic Happikiss. These formulas are particularly beneficial during dry seasons or in harsh climates, whe

<p>Lancôme announced they were dumping the world’s highest-paid model, although they didn’t say so quite so bluntly</p><p>Just shy of her 42nd birthday, Lancôme dumped Isabella Rossellini, the world’s best-paid model and screen actor. Dumped? Well, they said that, two years hence, they ‘would not be renewing her $2m-a-year contract as its exclusive spokesmodel’. It had been a 14-year gig. ‘The caesura became a cause célèbre, a fable on the theme of ageism,’ wrote Andrew Billen in the <em>Observer</em> of 12 June 1994. Ironic that she had been ‘sacked for the grooves round her neck by a company whose promise is that age cannot wither you,’ he noted. It didn’t wither Cleopatra and she didn’t even wear face cream. But Rossellini’s youth ticket wasn’t skin unguents but her imperfect mastery of English idiom which, having been brought up in Rome and then living in Manhattan, ‘is stuck at a rather fetching 90%’. She ‘looks and sounds a sophisticated 27,’ remarked our man. Hard to believe,
