Very existential, very somber. But in the time since I\u2019ve made that video, I\u2019ve realized that maybe I was duped.\n\nMaybe this technology isn\u2019t all powerful, all capable, and maybe there are limitations that technological progress can\u2019t solve.\n\nMaybe this is destined to just make funny clips on the internet.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m gonna take a look back at what\u2019s happened, what I think will happen, and why ultimately AI art isn\u2019t going to replace humans.",
