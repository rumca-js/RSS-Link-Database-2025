Firearms Factory is about your candy factory being forcibly converted into a weapons factory during World War II.

Producing weapons for your country and winning the war is your main objective.</p> <p>Firearms Factory is a mix of Tycoon, Strategy, and Simulation genres. My biggest inspirations are Game Dev Tycoon, This War of Mine, and Hearts of Iron IV. For now, I plan to include a campaign mode where you\u2019ll play through a story about discovering fission, but I also really want to create a sandbox version in the future.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Firearms Factory doesn\u2019t have a demo yet, but one will be available in a few months. If the theme interests you, I\u2019d be very happy if you could add it to your wishlist!</p> <p>Steam Page: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered",

Alongside making the gameplay fun, we&#39;re also putting a lot of effort into the story. We decided to go with a somewhat cartoonish graphic style for the theme.

At the moment, our game features single-player mode, but we also plan to add multiplayer in the future. We don&#39;t have a specific release date yet, but we\u2019ll be finalizing those plans soon.

The reason we describe it this way is that during the day, you\u2019ll be trying to gather votes in your country, while at night, you\u2019ll be battling crime. The concept revolves around using the powers of a cute creature named Fluffy to take the place of a corrupt president.</p> <p>The game will feature a bit of base building, some mini-games, and plenty of action.

Often releasing to overly negative or at best mixed reviews. Some closing quite quickly. Now to determine if this game is a true success, like every mmorpg, well have to see what it looks like in a year. But the initial response of the public at large has been surprisingly positive. With it seeing consecutive growth for 3 weeks in a row now. Peaking at about 5,300 so far today. Which again for a crowd funded, niche indie mmorpg?
