<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i will be saving money, it really doesnt matter how much money my headset will cost. keeping that in mind, should i get the quest 3 or valve index? only thing that matters are the lenses, because with the quest 2 i get very bad (VERY BAD) eye strain, making it pretty much unplayable, as i get physically and mentally tired from it. ( i even have the night mode on, and brightness at the lowest. i even tried playing vrchat with the brightness at the lowest to no avail. even tried each ipd mode) big question is, <strong>what are the lenses like on the valve index,</strong> compared to the quest 3? i know they are very good on the quest 3.</p> <p>im leaning towards the valve index, as the controllers are preferable, but i do not want to deal with eye strain.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/smallterkey"> /u/smallterkey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1huioke/q

Strolling along a forest trail, which he used to love... </p> <p>I&#39;m a total noob so i&#39;m not even sure if people can &quot;move&quot; in virtual realities if they can&#39;t stand up IRL and walk?</p> <p>We do not have a gaming PC, nor could i get his regular PC into the living room, so this would have to be a laptop situation or standalone system i can set up by his recliner...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently I&#39;ve gotten more into VR fitness, and some of these workouts can get very intense. For example, on Thrill of the Fight 2, I am sweating like an altar boy at a priest convention after just 15 minutes, it&#39;s very intense! </p> <p>The problem is the sweat can accumulate and cause visibility problems and even brick your headset. What I ended up doing is buying a &quot;VR Sweat Mask Foam Band&quot; (you can search Amazon, I didn&#39;t want to provide direct links to advertise any specific product). This mask fits on your face separate from the headset, and then you put the headset on top, it works remarkably well.</p> <p>Other accessories I strongly recommend (coming from a Quest 3 perspective):</p> <p>- Controller grips, the ones that have a band going across the back of your hand, will also protect from sweat and allow you to hold it more securely</p> <p>- Facial interface, the default Quest 3 one will get very stinky and full of dead sk

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi All, I’ve just pulled my old HTC Vive out of storage and used in with flight sim on my new PC and have been absolutely blown away. It’s game changing. When I used it years ago it was on a much older system that was barely capable of anything and I put it aside and forgot about it. My only problem is that it’s quite blurry/pixelated and I can’t read any of the dials or any other text unless it’s massive. I was thinking of upgrading the headset to suit the new system and did look at the vive pro 2 and some others, but I’ve come across the quest 3 and it looks like it fits all the boxes, plus I can use it away from the PC etc. Plus the price tag is great. </p> <p>I guess my question is, will I notice a big jump between (what I think is) the original HTC Vive and the quest 3 in terms of picture quality, readability, immersion ect. </p> <p>If the tech hasn’t come that far and it’s still blurry and illegible I won’t bother. </p> <p>I’m happy to take adv

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have had the Bobovr S3 Pro for around six months, and I only have a few complaints such as if you are not almost completely bald, the knob will twist your hair, and if you have longer hair the battery hop-swappable design may catch into it. Also, even if you use as little force as possible, if you&#39;re turning on the headset the force of you mashing the power button will move the headset and off-center the sweetspot. </p> <p>I bought the Globular Cluster F3 facial interface and it&#39;s completely lifechanging when used with the S3 Pro. It&#39;s soft, integrates well with the aforementioned headstrap, and they are quite a few different materials to choose from if one isn&#39;t comfortable for you.</p> <p>I have also tried the Maecker Rechargeable Controller Grips and they were pretty good.

I connected it to my PC through air link, without issues, and the games ran pretty smoothly. </p> <p>About 15 minutes in though I started getting issues. I got 3-5 minute periods of intense lagging, with very low fps, game running in slow motion, crazy high latency, audio lagging and my surroundings not rendering.
