In hardware news this week, we cover some law firms looking at Class Action possibilities with NZXT, a round-up of the final RTX 50-series GPU specs leaks before NVIDIA's formal announcement (likely tomorrow), AMD 9070 leaks, a new OneXPlayer G1 convertible handheld gaming PC, and more. Meta's dystopian AI "friends" get a mini-rant about the death of the internet as we know it, plus we get another AI supercut of CEO obsession.
