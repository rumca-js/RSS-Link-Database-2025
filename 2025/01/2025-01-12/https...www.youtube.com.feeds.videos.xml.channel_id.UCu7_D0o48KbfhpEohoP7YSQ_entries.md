Artificial Intelligence offers a lot of chances for microcontrollers! As always, around this time of the year, I will look at this topic from a broader angle to see the implications of this technology on our hobby and professional lives. It extends the video on “rules” and shows how they are interwoven with Artificial Intelligence. As usual, I will stick to the implications on sensors and microcontrollers, and I hope you will get some useful insights for your decisions in 2025. And the project I will build will be “for the cat”, as we say in German.
