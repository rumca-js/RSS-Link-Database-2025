<b>Honorable Mention: Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</b>
<br></br>
Despite it partly being a Hawaiian getaway for the crew from RGG Studio’s RPG debut Yakuza: Like A Dragon in 2020, the follow-up Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth was rather heavy. It’s an examination of family, legacy, and what you do with the time you have left. Series-long protagonist Kazuma Kiryu teaming up with his successor in Kasuga Ichiban made for a beautiful passing of the torch. I came for the detailed and nuanced recreation of Waikiki, but it’s the bittersweet and inspiring moments in Infinite Wealth that reminded us why there’s just nothing like the Yakuza franchise.
