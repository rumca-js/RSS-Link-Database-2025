Maybe? Than again, it may require a semi-free-floating aim crosshair (I can only imagine the nausea if gryo controls move your entire field of view) but it may still be better than gaze aim.

It constantly slips down my face and the Velcro to make it tighter is tearing away from the headset.

But suddenly, they decided to start drifting today. It isn&#39;t an issue with reflective objects in my room because I removed all of them and was working fine. I tried uninstalling steam vr, deleting the drivers folder, BUT STILL they keep drifting! What do I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GoodPlagueDoctor"> /u/GoodPlagueDoctor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hzcq6l/vive_30_trackers_now_drift_after_use_for_about_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hzcq6l/vive_30_trackers_now_drift_after_use_for_about_a/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking about getting a Meta Quest 3. Will I have a good gaming experience with a RTX 3060 Ti + R5 3600? I&#39;m sticking to 1080p resolution and 60fps, if that’s sufficient for VR, I didn&#39;t find a benchmark with that GPU so I have no idea how many fps it can get. If you have a similar spec, please share that info.</p> <p>I won’t be playing performance-heavy games, just titles like Phasmophobia, Minecraft (with VR mod), Elite Dangerous, and HL Alyx. </p> <p>Will using 1080p resolution with Quest 3 be a bad experience because of the resolution I&#39;ll be playing? Like blurry, choppy, idk. I&#39;ll upgrade my PC in the future. Or should I upgrade my PC first before getting that VR headset? Would you recommend any other VR headset based on my PC specs?</p> <p>Thanks!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pixel_Nuts"> /u/Pixel_Nuts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com
