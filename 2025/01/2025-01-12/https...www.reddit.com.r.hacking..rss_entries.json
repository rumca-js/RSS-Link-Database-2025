Burp suite is a more powerful tool which helps users control the network requests etc. All this allows the user better control over the client-side of what they interact with on computer networks/internet. </p> <p>What I am looking for is something that allows me to have similar level of control over apps. Most of the apps these days are basically just front-ends for the Android/iOS surface, but these don&#39;t let users have nearly the same level of control on the client-side. If the app is completely/mostly on-device, then something that allows tinkering with the client-side Android application",

But I&#39;m a little confused on when you would use the -u flag to test a URL, versus capturing a request in Burp Suite, then sending it to SQLmap. </p> <p>Are the requests only for login forms? That&#39;s the only time I see them come up when finding YT vids/blogs on the topic. </p> <p>Would appreciate the clarification.
