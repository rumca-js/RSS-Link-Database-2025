A movie isn’t automatically bad just because it didn’t keep you awake while you were already running on fumes.

I found the overlapping and simultaneous images in Megalopolis to be genuinely incredible and a spectacle to watch. Same goes for Speed Racer where it breaks down the traditional style of storytelling with its whacky style and beautiful sequences of overlapping settings and characters. </p> <p>Looking online I’ve seen recommendations like Southland Tales, Under the Silver Lake and The Fountain.

## Gaston has eaten at least 534,360 eggs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came to that conclusion because he says that “When I was a lad, I ate four dozen eggs, ev’ry morning to help me get large. And now that I&#39;m grown, I eat five dozen eggs, so I&#39;m roughly the size of a barge!” So with this knowledge, we now need to approximate when Gaston would have started eating four dozen eggs, and when he started eating five dozen eggs. For when he started eating four dozen eggs, let’s say three. Now thanks MatPat for figuring out that beauty and the beast happens sometime between 1730 and 1789. So this means Gaston would probably stop being considered a lad at 16. So therefore you need to multiply the amount of days in a year by 13, which is the amount of years that Gaston was eating four dozen eggs, by four dozen. 227,760. Multiply 365 with 60 and 14 you get 306,600. Add 227,760 and 306,000 and you get 534,360. What small provincial town is producing 534,000 eggs in 27 years????</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty clear to me that Driver&#39;s philosophy is that if he works with amazing directors, he&#39;s going to improve his chances of being in great movies and improve his craft. While it doesn&#39;t always work out and he sometimes has small roles, for the most part it does seem to pay off. Driver&#39;s average movie score on Metacritic is 70/100 with movies like Baumbach&#39;s &quot;Marriage Story&quot; (94/100), Coen Brothers&#39; &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (93/100), Jarmush&#39;s &quot;Paterson&quot; (90/100) and Spielberg&#39;s &quot;Lincoln&quot; (87/100) at the top.</p> <p>Other than Daniel Day Lewis (76/100), you&#39;d struggle to find other actors with average metacritic scores as high as Driver. For example, Dicaprio (64/100), Cruise (62/100), Frances McDormand (67/100), Joaquin Phoenix (63/100), Denzel (64/100), Hanks (62/100).</p> <p>Driver seems to seek out roles like he&#39;s adding great directors to his Pokédex.</p> <p><s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Written by Dr. Seuss The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T tells a story of a young boy who detests taking piano lessons, Bart Collins (Tommy Rettig) has developed a deep suspicion of his strict instructor, Dr. Terwilliker (Hans Conried). Raised by his single mother, Heloise (Mary Healy), Bart looks up to the local plumber August Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes). When Bart ends up in a Seussian dreamworld, he must join with Zabladowski to rescue his mom from Dr. T&#39;s clutches and stop his plan to force 500 boys to play a massive piano in perpetuity.

Bender was my favorite after watching the movie for the first few times, but I think Andy is the best character because of how he is the only one in the film to defend almost everyone at some point in the movie. He defends Claire from Bender, Brian from Bender, and Allison from Claire. He liked Allison for who she was before the makeover scene and was the only one who actually checked in on her. He also did the worst thing out of the group to earn him detention, yet was the most remorseful about what he did. Andy was a well balanced character in the movie, being somewhat of a coward by ironically trying to put on a tough guy act for his father and friends for their approval. He also liked to think that he would be the one brave enough to be cool with the others when they wen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve noticed I’m fallen back to genuinely rooting for good guys over ‘cool anti-heroes’ from the 90’s I used to pull for.</p> <p>I noticed first when I was watching Point Break, one of my favorite action-flicks from back in the day. In the 90’s I thought Bodi was such a bad ass dude-against-the-system spiritualist rebel. Now I watch it and think he’s a self-serving prick that got a lot of people killed, and set in motion a situation where he could have gotten an ex-girlfriend tortured to death.</p> <p>Today when I watch it I wonder WTF Utah is doing just letting Bodi go surfing after he caused the deaths of undercover officers, his crew, and legit got Utah’s partner shotgun blasted in the back. “And you’re just gonna’ let him go surfing, bro?”</p> <p>Kind of amazing what I was cool with as a 90’s teenager. Then Bodi seemed to have some sort of noble cause and I forgave him for a helluva lot of bad. Now I’m like “Yooooo that dude belongs in a cage, ma

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished Lawrence Of Arabia I personally loved it It took my dad and me a few nights to finish watching this film. At first, he didn’t see what all the hype was about, joking, “This is a masterpiece? It’s just people walking around in the desert me and your mom used to do this all the time what is the difference between a white men does it and us Arabs .” But by the time we finished, we couldn’t stop talking about it about T. E. Lawrence as a person, the complexity of his choices, and the layers of morality and politics that shape the story. It’s a film that lingers in your mind, sparking conversation long after it’s over.</p> <p>The movie, based on the life of T. E. Lawrence, follows his efforts to unite Arabian tribes and lead them in a military campaign against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. As an Arab that has bedu ancestry it is amazing how this film played out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://ww

## How refreshing it is to go in to films completely blind; never seeing a trailer or reading about the film itself. This way, even bad films don't tend to disappoint.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been getting through a few films that came out in the past couple of years, knowing absolutely nothing about them (except for, say, the genre of film) and ultimately being thrilled with what I just watched. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It wont work for everyone but I personally enjoy sitting to watch a film with zero expectations or notions of what it will be about, that way the whole screening usually ends up being a positive affair. Yesterday I watched The Menu for the first time and the only assumption I had of it was that it was maybe about food. Totally blown away by how good it was and ultimately what it was about. Such a great mix of black comedy with weird tense moments. If I had read a brief synopsis or watched the trailer, the unexpectedness of what takes place would have been ruined.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t always work out where I can avoid things like this; I saw the trailer for Companion and then read a comment about Jack Qua

Don’t expect a masterpiece because it’s not, it copies elements from way better movies (Friday for example). The chemistry between the actresses was great. The comedy and humor it’s not all that. It’s kinda dumb comedy. Still people that want something light after spending their money on Christmas should go and watch it and maybe even feel identified with the characters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rican1093"> /u/Rican1093 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hzc93z/one_of_them_days_early_screening/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hzc93z/one_of_them_days_early_screening/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ok I know this movie is not at all recent, but I just got around to it and love it. I’m a big time loop fan.</p> <p>My first thought after seeing the ending was, what if the “real world” we were watching was also an alternate timeline, or not the first time the source code was used. </p> <p>If this captain stopped this crisis, were there previous crises on different timelines that were stopped by the captain, therefore making a new timeline where he hasn’t been activated yet? So the next crisis that comes up, then creates another timeline and the process repeats?</p> <p>Hopefully this makes sense, loved the movie.
