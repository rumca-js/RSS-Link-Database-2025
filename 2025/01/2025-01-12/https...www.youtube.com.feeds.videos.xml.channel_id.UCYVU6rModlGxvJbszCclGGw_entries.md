We take a break from tech to show you a close up view of the burnt out husk of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles. Wiped out by the fire that started on January 7, 2025. This was recorded on Saturday Jan 12. By this time, the Palisades fire took this neighborhood from the map. Wiped it out. And now has spread to the opposite direction and going to more populated areas. By this time the fire was at Mandeville Canyon in Brentwood. And the areas near the I-405 Freeway including Brentwood, and Bel-Air have been evacuated.
