<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for suggestions about a tool for Android similar to browsers, or proxy (like Burp), etc. The idea is that a person can view and edit the html on a page when they are using a browser, they can even open a console and run jacascript commands and scripts in it, they can go to the network tab and see the network requests and responses. Burp suite is a more powerful tool which helps users control the network requests etc. All this allows the user better control over the client-side of what they interact with on computer networks/internet. </p> <p>What I am looking for is something that allows me to have similar level of control over apps. Most of the apps these days are basically just front-ends for the Android/iOS surface, but these don&#39;t let users have nearly the same level of control on the client-side. If the app is completely/mostly on-device, then something that allows tinkering with the client-side Android application

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m learning SQL injections in the PNPT course. I understand how to use SQLmap just fine. But I&#39;m a little confused on when you would use the -u flag to test a URL, versus capturing a request in Burp Suite, then sending it to SQLmap. </p> <p>Are the requests only for login forms? That&#39;s the only time I see them come up when finding YT vids/blogs on the topic. </p> <p>Would appreciate the clarification.
