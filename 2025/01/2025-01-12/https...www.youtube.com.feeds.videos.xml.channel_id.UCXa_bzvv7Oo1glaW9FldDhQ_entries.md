Sony, its raft of first-party studios, and a host of third parties all have a ton of enticing PlayStation 5 exclusives in the works for us this year. In terms of games that are announced, there’s eleven we can look forward to, and although only four of these titles are all-but confirmed for a 2025 release we can feel safe in assuming there’s at least a handful more that’ll see the light of day before the year is out. 

Sony’s first-party studios have new games in the pipeline but even if these games get released next year or not, we’re still looking at 2025 being a banner year for Sony’s current-gen console. It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that 2025 will be remembered as the biggest year for PS5 exclusives.

Assetto Corsa EVO is the hotly anticipated follow-up to 2014’s long-standing racing simulation Assetto Corsa. In-between these two titles however is the GT3 focused Assetto Corsa Competizione, with this feature aiming to unpack all that differentiates the 2018 spin-off from the upcoming EVO. 

As it happens, there’s a ton of difference centring on everything from track detail and car physics to vehicle rosters, career modes, and opponent AI. 

Should Assetto Corsa EVO deliver on the promise of its innovations, then we could be looking at a landmark title in simulation racing. The only caveat is all the features discussed here won’t be available at launch – Assetto Corsa EVO is releasing initially via early access on January 16th, 2025.
