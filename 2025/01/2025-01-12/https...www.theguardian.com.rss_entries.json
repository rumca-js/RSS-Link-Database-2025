Usually, speeches about ingredients and the best way to eat your lunch, feel like a nail puncture purposefully engineered to let all the air out of any fun you were hoping to have. Lunch becomes an exam to be passed. Am I doing this right? Will the staff approve? Oh, the social anxiety. Today, however, there is an enthusiasm to the tableside chat and an engrossing level of detail. I\u2019m all in, at least for now.

But I would like to put in a word for another kind of self-care, one that is rooted in pure escapism and the healing power of the sun. It works best, in my experience, if you first find a diverting but not too taxing book (pioneering British food writer Elizabeth David\u2019s Mediterranean Food from 1950 is my nostalgic choice) to set the imaginative scene; then it\u2019s just a question of finding the right wine to p",
