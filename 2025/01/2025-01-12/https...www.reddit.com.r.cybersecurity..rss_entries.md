<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Letâ€™s jump letâ€™s say 10 years ahead in time. Companies are now using ASI agents deployed in their infrastructure that is able to patch zero day vulnerabilities. Obviously agents being a new vector, threat actors will also be using ASI to try to infiltrate the defensive ASI agent to gain access. We can even make the argument that the offensive side of ASI will be more powerful because it wonâ€™t have any guardrails built into it to be ethical.</p> <p>What is a human security engineers doing now to keep the ASI agent secure? Not only from i filtration, data poisoning, but also from potentially going rogue, or just simply having too strict security measures that disrupt business operations. My guess would be that we would still have to have configurations, fail safe, patching vulnerabilities in the model itself if it isnâ€™t already able to patch itself, ethics, etc.</p> <p>Opinions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.re

But I haven&#39;t seen anyone mentioning this simple fact: If you don&#39;t apply within the first two weeks of a job posting, your chances of getting an interview are extremely slim. I&#39;ll explain why.</p> <p>So in most medium to enterprise-sized companies, recruiters are the first person to meet with an applicant. Usually there will be one recruiter assigned to look after your role. But in the background they&#39;ll actually be handling more than one role, so in practice they can spend only a portion of their capacity for your role. This means that they can interview like 3-5 candidates in a round. And each round takes somewhere between 1-3 weeks due to candidate&#39;s availability.</p> <p>Let&#39;s assume that you need to sift
