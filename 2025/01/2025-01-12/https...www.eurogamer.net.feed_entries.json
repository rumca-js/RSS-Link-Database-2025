As a result, many games - both announced and unannounced - were abruptly cancelled and as new games arrived on other platforms, many often wondered, would these titles have been possible on Dreamcast? Well, with an unofficial homebrew release of Grand Theft Auto 3 on the classic Sega machine, we finally have an answer for at least one of those questions.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-new-grand-theft-auto-3-dreamcast-port-is-an-astonishing-achievement\">Read more</a></p>",

Trust me, I've been there. For the last few weeks, I've been replaying Arkane Austin's Prey, an immersive sim in which you explore a space station orbiting the moon. You're trying to find out what went wrong - and why the whole place is overrun by hostile aliens. It's an interesting tone, though. Despite the space station being hectic with nasty life, you spend a lot of time on your own - and yet that doesn't mean there's no sense of humanity to the game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/arkanes-prey-built-a-world-where-i-really-cared-about-the-choices-i-made\">Read more</a></p>",
