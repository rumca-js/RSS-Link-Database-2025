I already use RTSS with it limited to 96Hz and V-Sync off but still often I&#39;d get stuttering. But I&#39;ve found a fix that works for me across games (Witcher, Cyberpunk, Doom etc...) and that is to press Win + G and turn on the performance overlay. You can just select only fps and make the box super small and put it in the corner and voila, smooth gameplay. I&#39;m not sure why this works, but it does for me. I&#39;m on Windows 11 and have an AMD CPU + GPU. I thought I&#39;d share this with you all.

## Why do devs still fail to make Healers and Tanks fun to play?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t get it. We have decades worth of data and player interaction and yet developers still fail to make Halers and Tanks as fun to play as the DPS characters.</p> <p>You know that people want to dish out damage, so make Healers and Tanks that can dish out damage and that can engage in the battle, instead of being pure heal and shield bots.</p> <p>And the crazy thing is, the issue is already solved. Take Heroes of the Storm for example. Before Blizzard nerfed the Healer class into the ground, they were genuinly fun to play. They weren&#39;t pure heal bots, but could farm Creeps and hold their own in a fight as well. And if you were in a 1v1 fight with another character, there was a good chance that the Healer would come out victorious.</p> <p>And other games did it as well. Battlefield has a fun healer class. Rainbow Six Siege has a fun healer class, Apex Legends has healers and tanks that are fun to play, so does Pokemon Unite.</p> <p>And

I’ve tried with multiple cords, plugging into my case and my motherboard. Please help I have no idea what could be wrong, especially since my controller is fairly new and has no issues on an xbox.
