<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The most obvious parallel lies in the central conceit of both books: the perpetuation of a major lie by powerful religious institutions. In <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, the Catholic Church suppresses the truth about Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, while in <em>The Priory of the Orange Tree</em>, Virtudom maintains a false history started by Galian Berethnet. There&#39;s also Jacques Saunière&#39;s (member of the Priory) protection of Sophie Neveu, a descendant of the Merovingian bloodline, being similar to Ead Duryan&#39;s (member of the Priory) protection of Sabran, descendant of who people believe was Cleolind Onjenyu.</p> <p>In both novels, the Priory represents a secret society with a feminine association. In <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, the Priory of Sion is linked to the veneration of the Divine Feminine and protecting a secret, while in <em>The Priory of the Orange Tree</em>, the Priory of the Orange Tree is itself led by women and has secrets

That’s why Court of Silver Flames is the best ACOTAR installment (and also the spiciest.)</p> <p>The TV show will be much improved if it weaves in Nesta as a central heroine from the beginning.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><blockquote> <p>But this time I am asking for op mc who is in charge. Like legend of arch magus.</p> <p>where is mc isn&#39;t the most powerful but he is respected and I mean let&#39;s be honest he is powerful.</p> <p>Or system universe. Where they make mc a threat and do not undermine him. What I didn&#39;t like was dotf where I mean it was enjoyable but whole Zac saw a c class person and I became disinterested and sad that he has such hurdle to pass. And I didn&#39;t like the primal hunter I just didn&#39;t</p> <p>And I also didn&#39;t like Kieran the eternal mage. I have read book 1 and I hate he struggles. I wish mc who is actually in charge or respected. </p> <p>That is probably why I love kingdom building novell with op mc. </p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pevergonnagiveyouup"> /u/Pevergonnagiveyouup </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hza4w2/i_am
