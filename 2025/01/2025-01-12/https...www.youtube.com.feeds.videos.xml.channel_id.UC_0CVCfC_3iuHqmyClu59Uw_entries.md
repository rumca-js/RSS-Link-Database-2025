2025 is shaping up to be a landmark year for handheld gaming, and we got a glimpse of the exciting future at CES 2025. Two standout devices stole the show: the Tencent Sunday Dragon 3D and the Zotac ZOTAC ZONE.
The Tencent Sunday Dragon #D boasts an incredible 11-inch glassless 3D display, immersing you in games like never before. This innovative technology eliminates the need for special glasses, making it more accessible and comfortable for gamers. Zotac upgraded its popular ZOTAC ZONE with the powerful AMD Ryzen AI 8 HX370 APU. This powerful processor ensures smooth and responsive gameplay, even for the most demanding titles.
