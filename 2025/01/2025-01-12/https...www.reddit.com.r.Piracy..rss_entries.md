<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, as the title says, I would like to know if there is an app for music streaming in high quality. I&#39;m currently using spotify, but lyrics works on only some songs for me, and I find it a bit too glitchy for what it once was. I was searching out of curiosity for streaming apps like Apple Music or Tidal, but I learned that the first one is server based and the second one is patched. Anyone has apps that DON&#39;T rely/are based on YouTube Music like RiMusic ecc...? I tried them, didn&#39;t like them at all.

I can stream on my home connection using my phone on the same site.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried using a VPN, and that sometimes works but still has most of the same issues. I&#39;ve also disabled my adblock to no avail. I&#39;m in the UK using Virgin Media, and have the issue on all web browsers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You know back in the old days you had a CD. You put it in the computer and got to the installation wizard. There you had to enter the secret KEY (that you would get printed on your pirated cd case, or which was in a text file in the crack folder), and you would install the game.</p> <p>HOWEVER, you were then required to also copy and paste the cracked .exe of the game from the crack folder and replace the .exe that was just generated by your installation.</p> <p>So why was this necessary? Since you had already entered the secret key? Did the installation make some kind of secret hash with an identifier from your computer so you couldn&#39;t just copy paste the game files once you had installed them?</p> <p>How did this evolve? In later years you needed more and more files for cracking, and sometimes run fishy scripts. I remember GTA IV installation being pretty involved. They had the Social Club established by then and the internet. Yea, I guess once

But after every module theres this unskippable ad telling you to donate. Any way around this? i&#39;ve tried ublock origin and other adblockers, and i&#39;ve tried removing some code in inspect element but to no avail.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got an older phone and Amazon TV and both often struggle to keep up with streams without getting laggy. Internet connection is very good 100+ mbs, devices are just showing thier age. Stream work fine on my laptop which leads me to believe it&#39;s the devices themselves. Stream doesn&#39;t need to be HD, I&#39;m okay with accepting some drawbacks to quality just for a smooth stream. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Titandog21"> /u/Titandog21 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hza7h8/looking_for_a_sports_streaming_site_that_can_run/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hza7h8/looking_for_a_sports_streaming_site_that_can_run/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I had been watching all old WWE from 93, I made it to like 97.</p> <p>I am in aus so was able to do this through Binge but now it is on netflix and they have basically no older episodes. I talked to support who said they wouldn&#39;t be getting it and all I could is request it.</p> <p>What is best way for me to continue doing old wwe? Is it VPN for wwe network or a way to download all old episode&#39;s?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoOneImportantOCE"> /u/NoOneImportantOCE </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hz9p4l/wwe_netflix_moved_has_ruined_my_plans/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hz9p4l/wwe_netflix_moved_has_ruined_my_plans/">[comments]</a></span>
