I have many hours on Slay the Spire and want to get any recommendations for similar board games. I&#39;ve had a hard time finding similar things. </p> <p>I know there is a board game for slay the spire, but I&#39;m keen on some different things that I can play with people who are unfamiliar with deck builders. A flashy art style is important for this too. </p> <p>I&#39;d appreciate any recommendations at all!</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adriananan_\"> /u/adriananan_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hzknmt/games_similar_to_slay_the_spire/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hzknmt/games_similar_to_slay_the_spire/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I wasn\u2019t sure how it\u2019d be received or if they would get overwhelmed with the different card scoring modes (the only board games they\u2019d played before this one are Ludo and Uno). But it was a great success and begged to keep on playing. </p> <p>What\u2019s the X-factor? The bright illustrations? The way the cards rotate between players? </p> <p>If you know any other games that would be good if they like Sushi Go please recommend! (We were thinking Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza, is it any good?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Intrepid_Beginning\"> /u/Intrepid_Beginning </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hza2dp/what_makes_sushi_go_so_fun_for_little_ones/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hza2dp/what_makes_sushi_go_so_fun_for_little_ones/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>On Christmas, ny adult nephew gave me Pagan: the Fate of Roanoke as a gift. He knows I like asymmetric games, but he gave me the game mostly because of the name. It turns out to be a good game. Not my usual style (I favor games that can be taught in 15 minutes because I belong to a ski club and I am responsible for \u201ckeeping teenagers off their screens\u201d). This game is a bit fiddly &amp; compkex in the rules for my taste, but\u2026</p> <p>I have been playing the game every day with my daughter (a college junior) who is home for winter break. It has been a nice way for us to hang out and come together over a shared interest.</p> <p>Yay, boardgaming!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mykepagan\"> /u/mykepagan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hz9rzw/praise_for_boardgaming/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hz9rzw/praise",
