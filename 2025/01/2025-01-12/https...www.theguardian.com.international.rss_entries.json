Sam &amp; Dave\u2019s biggest hit was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ONNSlk--tE\">Soul Man</a> (1967), which topped the US R&amp;B chart and reached No 2 on the pop chart. Its funky, driving beat, powerful horns and vocal interplay between Moore\u2019s high tenor voice and Prater\u2019s gritty baritone made it a soul and gospel classic.</p><p>Its writers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/12/popandrock.jazz\">Isaac Hayes</a> and David Porter, had drawn inspiration from the US civil rights movement, seeing the song as \u201ca story about one man\u2019s struggle to rise above his present conditions\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/12/sam-moore-obituary\">Continue reading...</a>",
