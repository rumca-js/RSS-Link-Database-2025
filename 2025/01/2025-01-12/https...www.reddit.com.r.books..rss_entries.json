I&#39;ve followed the youtuber for a couple of years and though I agree with some of his critiques, other times I find him biased and polarizing. I also watched his recent short film &quot;Rogue Elements&quot; which is based on the Ryan Drake series. The film was merely FINE in my opinion; it doesn&#39;t really add anything new to the genre or show off his movie making chops. Of course, there are those who decry the film&#39;s quality thus discrediting him as a critic. I&#39;m more concerned on the Ryan Drake books. To be honest, the books get the job done. They are entertaining and serve justice to the action thriller genre; of course one can&#39;t help but notice his possible self-insert in the Ryan Drake character and his opinionated descriptions of certain female characters though I wouldn&#39;t go as far as call it degrading or consider certain characters a &quot;Mary Sue.",

I may be biased because I was into the show &quot;24&quot; at the time so the parallels of terrorism and torture were intriguing. Not to mention that it took place in the Bay Area, where I&#39;m from, so I was able to relate a little bit in that aspect. In the sequel &quot;Homeland&quot;, the book introduced me to the Burning Man festival (I don&#39;t intend to go, but I learned how intriguing it was) and covered how a political candidate may use advanced technology for a political campaign and even addressed how far the government may go to reign in free speech, protest, and freedom of assembly.

What I liked about TikTok was that the algorithm kinda recommended books that I would like based on what it previously showed me. </p> <p>But once TikTok gets banned, I\u2019m wondering where to get recommendations. I feel like with the ban, coming across new authors will also be very hard. </p> <p>Reddit is too broad and open ended to get any personalized recommendations, unless it\u2019s very specific. Twitter is twitter. So no. And instagram feels more about the aesthetics of reading rather than about reading/discussions about it. </p> <p>My main issue is that even if I use these platforms, 90% of the time, I can only get recommendations from the authors I\u2019ve already read.

The stories are provocative, the characters struggle with their loneliness and social standing, navigating love interests as well as friendships in true millennial manner and turning into the complete opposite of their beliefs! It\u2019s so fascinating to read. The prose is intelligent, sharp.

All the brutalities done by Japanese reminded me that I need to read more about Asia&#39;s history. </p> <p>Anyway, what I wanted to know was, if you&#39;ve read it, what did you think about Endo San&#39;s and Philip&#39;s relationship?

Many of these authors write young girls (boys too but it tends to be women) as very adult-like and it\u2019s not very often to read about a child who actually seems like a child.</p> <p>The most common argument I see about this subject is that that\u2019s how it happened in the real world throughout history. I think that argument is a load of crap. In books with dragons and magic, historical accuracy seems to be thrown out the window until it comes to relationships. </p> <p>If you can have a fantasy world you can make that world have less creepy age gaps. Nobody is going to be taken out of a fantastical story by including actual adults being sexualized instead of young teenage children lol.</p> <p>Has anyone else noticed this? Do you think I\u2019m reaching here? </p> <p>Edit",
