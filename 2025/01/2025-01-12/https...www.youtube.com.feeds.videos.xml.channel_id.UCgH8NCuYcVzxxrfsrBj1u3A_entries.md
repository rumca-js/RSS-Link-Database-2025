Mixed Up Everything are an Australian band of brothers. They've been in the public eye since going viral as kids - which led to comparisons with Hanson. They're not Hanson, they have more hair and recently supported The Offspring. I'm reviewing "Normality" because I was asked to many times and frankly, it needs to stop.

You can find "Normality" here:  https://youtu.be/FEhSzms6bGE?si=Bm4Dmh8SwGCIC_Od
