<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s possible to create or buy a radio frequency jammer. I have a person living with me who plays his radio at full volume all day and it&#39;s very annoying. Anyway, if someone has the knowledge of how to make this device, I would appreciate it if you could share it or if it&#39;s possible to buy it in the same way. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HighCherry22"> /u/HighCherry22 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hzxi9v/radio_jammer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hzxi9v/radio_jammer/">[comments]</a></span>
