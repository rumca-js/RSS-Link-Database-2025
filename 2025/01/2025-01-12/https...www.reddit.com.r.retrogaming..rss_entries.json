It was kind of in the same vein as angry birds where you launched things from your platform to the other opponent&#39;s side. There was some levels with a blimp in the center that could be taken down after several shots. You had a few types of ammunition like a mortar, bazooka, a ray gun... I remember this was the game that popularized ASL. You say ASL at the beginning of every match to ask your opponents generic information. Do you remember what it was called?
