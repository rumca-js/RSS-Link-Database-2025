<ul><li>Manchester United beat Arsenal on penalties in FA Cup</li><li>‘I felt since the first minute that today was our day’</li></ul><p>A jubilant Ruben Amorim said he had sensed his Manchester United side would beat Arsenal at the outset of a controversial third round tie at the Emirates. Amorim’s side rode out a storm with 10 men to force penalties, sealing the win through Joshua Zirkzee’s clinical strike, and he claimed the outcome had been clear in his mind as soon as proceedings began.</p><p>“The players were really tired but I felt since the first minute that today was our day,” Amorim said. “I also felt a connection with our fans, our staff. It was a very good day for us in that aspect.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/12/we-are-improving-in-the-way-we-suffer-amorim-delighted-by-shootout-success">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Place, London<br></strong>Youthful ambition and vision always charge the atmosphere with optimism at this festival of future dance talent</p><p>For 35 years The Place has been offering up an abundance of brand new choreography at its annual Resolution festival, over 2,000 artists so far. You get three pieces a night from newbie choreographers, some just out of training, some clearly going places. The output and quality varies wildly, but it’s thrown up some real talents over the years.</p><p>It’s an event where you can feel the optimism and the youthful ambition and vision. Where a choreographer’s blurb for their piece says it’s going to “transport the audience into a journey of spiritual and artistic evolution”. Yes please! Maybe the reality isn’t as transformational as it hopes, but the piece in question – Anima, by Duran ‘Dee Dee’ Abdullah – does showcase Abdullah as a performer who can hold the stage, with an ancient-ritualistic-drum’n’bass rave mood.</p> <a href="

It opens at the funeral of her father, Bill, on his home island of Shetland, a place she knows only in glimpses; her parents separated when she was two, and her relationship with her father was characterised by absence, “always promising something it would never deliver”. But her connection with the islands and her late father is forced into an accelerated intimacy; the funeral takes place in February 2020 as the pandemic spreads, and Brown finds herself unexpectedly spending the months of lockdown with her partner and young daughter in Shetland: “Confinement in a land that claimed half my genealogy, a history and culture of which I knew next to nothing about.”</p><p>They stay in th

<p><strong>Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon<br></strong>Shakespeare’s fleet-footed romance is somewhat constrained by Prasanna Puwanarajah’s direction, yet there are memorable moments</p><p>Life and death; joy and sorrow, riches and poverty – Shakespeare’s comedy plays on opposites associated with the feast for which it is named. At <em><a href="https://www.rsc.org.uk/twelfth-night/">Twelfth Night</a></em>, kings do reverence to a carpenter’s child, born to suffer, die and rise again. Like Nick Park, creator of Wallace and Gromit, Shakespeare knows how to cram contemporary cultural references into a popular entertainment, packing added pleasure for those who spot them, without clogging up the plot, however complicated.</p><p>Shipwrecked twins, Viola and Sebastian, each believes the other drowned. Stranded, penniless, Viola, dressed as a boy, is employed by Duke Orsino to woo Olivia, a lady mourning her own dead brother. Viola falls in love with Orsino; Olivia falls in l

<p>Two kinds of zesty citrus celebration to brighten any winter’s day</p><p>The kitchen is aglow with citrus fruit. The lemons came with their wide, glossy leaves intact. Oranges, their skin flashed with viridian at the stem and sporting thin, pointed leaves, smelled of their own blossom. A box of wrinkled green makrut limes, warty and beautiful, now sit waiting to be grated into a green curry sauce. There is even a handful of bergamots, the yellow-green lemons whose tantalisingly perfumed zest I will use in a pot of citrine yellow curd.</p><p>The tight-skinned citrus varieties, such as the neat clementines and larger, almost perfectly round Valencias, are inevitably the juiciest and a world away from the watery flavour of the easypeel varieties with baggy skins.

<p>Looking at a sepia-tinged picture of my grandmother, she has the kind of face you don’t see any more </p><p>The photo shows my grandmother. She’s among the adults at the back, fourth from right, peeping out from a row of old-timey faces. The kind of faces you don’t see any more, faces that could only come from the past. Even without the sepia tint and the period clothing, you know you’d have a hard time showing them an iPhone or talking to them about AI. Frankly, you’d have a hard time explaining ITV4.</p><p>But it <em>is</em> sepia-tinted, this photo, almost artificially so; its stock-still adults and fidgety kids captured in eerie permanence, so perfectly composed as to recall the cover of a stirring Irish childhood memoir. Judging by the boys and girls in their little suits and sparkling white dresses, it’s from a first holy communion ceremony, presumably one with pupils from the small primary school in Mulleek, Fermanagh, where she taught for 30 years.</p> <a href="https://www

<p>The stars play Jewish American cousins touring Poland in honour of their grandmother in Eisenberg’s sharp, highly personal comedy boasting an Oscar-tipped performance from Culkin</p><p>It’s a slip of a thing, clocking in at a tight 90 minutes; a deft, light-footed amalgamation of two potentially formulaic comedy genres: the road movie and the mismatched buddy flick. But the second directorial venture from actor Jesse Eisenberg, which he also wrote and stars in, is considerably more than the seemingly slight sum of its parts. <em>A Real Pain</em> is a whip-sharp comedy driven by the rattling verbal sparring between uptight, neurotic David (Eisenberg) and his outgoing, unpredictable cousin Benji (Kieran Culkin). It’s also a profound character study – a substantial and emotionally nourishing journey that contains, courtesy of Culkin, perhaps the most devastating final shot of any film you will see this year.</p><p>It’s a notable step up for Eisenberg as a writer-director.

<p>Fashions shift and now ‘too perfect’ white teeth risk wiping the smile off your face</p><p>Last summer, I fell and cracked four of my front teeth. Pieces chipped off at unhelpful times, I spat small shards politely into the sink and cursed every uneven paving stone and every apple, too. The dentist told me we wouldn’t know whether root canals or similar would be necessary for about six months and, as that six months rolls around, I find myself snarling into the mirror and thinking about teeth far more than is right.</p><p>Teeth are, I’d always thought, like deep sea creatures or details of my screen time, really none of my business. Their job is to gnaw, gnash, slice and grind as effectively and quietly as possible. My job is to keep them clean. That’s it. <em>Fin</em>. Beyond the brushing, none of my business. Cracking the front ones, however, has also opened a crack in my relationship with teeth, and now I am suddenly aware, not just of their precarious vulnerability, but of the

<p>Writers, therapists and academics give advice on how to make, and strengthen, meaningful bonds with mates and friends</p><p><strong>Emma Reed Turrell</strong><strong>, psychotherapist, author and host of the podcast Friendship Therapy</strong></p><p>You can keep balance in friendship by showing your working out, rather than making assumptions and mind-reading. This might sound like: “I’d like to invite you to a party but I’m wondering if it might not be your thing and I want you to know that you can absolutely say no, or just come for an hour.” That way you get to express your wish and your friend gets to be honest in their choices, rather than people-please you or dodge the question. Look for the ‘both/and’ of a balanced friendship, rather than an ‘either/or’ situation, and negotiate how to both get what you need from your communication styles or time together, rather than create a one-way street in which one of you is always keeping the other happy. Not everyone wants a two-way

<p>In this sequel to his bestseller, Critical, the intensive care doctor draws lessons on the joys of a ‘second life’ from the experiences of patients who have flatlined and been revived</p><p>“We have two lives,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matt-morgan">Dr Matt Morgan</a> writes, before clarifying: “The second begins when you realise you have [only] one.” Sometimes, as the case studies in this book detail, this realisation comes more suddenly and profoundly than most of us can imagine. For more than 20 years, Morgan has been a specialist doctor in intensive care, labouring at the extreme margins of life. Just occasionally, in his day-to-day education in human mortality, he has witnessed what might, in other traditions, be thought of as supernatural events: people whose vital signs have flatlined, but who have returned to tell the tale. The stories in this book – a sequel to his bestselling <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/critical-9781471173066/">Critical</

Usually, speeches about ingredients and the best way to eat your lunch, feel like a nail puncture purposefully engineered to let all the air out of any fun you were hoping to have. Lunch becomes an exam to be passed. Am I doing this right? Will the staff approve? Oh, the social anxiety. Today, however, there is an enthusiasm to the tableside chat and an engrossing level of detail. I’m all in, at least for now.

<p>Escape the gloom with these big red wines bursting with the flavours of warm countries</p><p><strong>Cuevas de Arom Altas Parcelas, Calatayud, Spain 2021 (£18.99, <a href="http://shelvedwine.com/">shelvedwine.com</a>) </strong>I’m open to almost any of the many suggestions for lifting the bleak, wintry post-Christmas mood proffered in columns like this at this time of the year. Whether it’s a matter of taking up running or cold swimming, practising yoga or meditation, or joining the abstinence anti-party of Veganuary or Dry January, it’s each to their own as far I’m concerned. But I would like to put in a word for another kind of self-care, one that is rooted in pure escapism and the healing power of the sun. It works best, in my experience, if you first find a diverting but not too taxing book (pioneering British food writer Elizabeth David’s Mediterranean Food from 1950 is my nostalgic choice) to set the imaginative scene; then it’s just a question of finding the right wine to p
