I have a 4060ti and Ryzen 7 7800x3d running Nobara 41 with KDE Plasma 6.2.4 with my valve index. This computer had handled everything else I&#39;ve thrown at it with ease but runs into issues with VR. In vr there is a significant and consistent amount of frame loss at all times and steamVR reports them as displaying errors, and it&#39;s only the vr display hitching like this, if I display vr view on my monitor everything looks smooth as butter. </p> <p>Any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/acruzjumper"> /u/acruzjumper </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hz

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, </p> <p>I&#39;m pretty new to Linux, I switched from Windows about 8 months ago and overall it&#39;s been a great experience. I&#39;ve had a consistent problem while playing The Finals though (other than updates breaking the game every once in a while). I can play through 3-4 matches and not have any issues, but when I hit my 4th or 5th match in a row I lose a significant amount of frames such that the game becomes unplayable. While watching btop in the terminal I see a slight dip in CPU use, but I rarely go above 30gb of RAM use while playing. </p> <p>What steps in troubleshooting should I take? Is there any info I can add that will help with diagnosing? </p> <p>I had the thought that it may be a mouse polling rate issue, I had a previous issue in Windows where my polling rate was too high and I lost significant frames while looking around in a FPS game. </p> <p>System info: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS Kernel: 6.9.3-76060903-generic AMD Ryzen

Concept of desktop agents starts around Win98 and peaks interest on WinXP (Clippy, BonziBuddy, SAM speech synthesis...).

I&#39;m not sure how to describe it but it happens when I play games sometimes while listening to podcasts and audiobooks. I don&#39;t notice it when listening to music, which is odd. Also not quite as noticable, if at all, while watching Youtube or Plex. I&#39;ve also had it happen while scrolling thru pics while listening to stuff. One time, I tried playing a game from my pc on the tv via a hdmi cable and had it happen there.</p> <p>Research tells me it has something to do with the AMD Infinity Fabric.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, guys. It&#39;s been the second day I&#39;m trying to get this game to work on Pop!_Os. I tried most of the commands from ProtonDB, but still same issue - after 2-5 mins of gameplay (pretty smooth gameplay I must say) it just hangs and I can&#39;t do anything until I get its process killed in system monitor. Anyone with the same issue? Is it maybe specifically nVidia related problem maybe?</p> <p>P.S: by the way, do I need to turn off auto cpufreq if I&#39;m launching this game with &#39;gamemoderun&#39; command? Do these 2 apps conflict with each other? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dvorakovsky"> /u/Dvorakovsky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hzgnks/stalker_2_on_pop_os_acer_nitro_v15/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hzgnks/stalker_2_on_pop_os_acer_nitro_v15/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So.. I&#39;ve been a PC gamer for decades, I gamed both on windows and linux, I remember when the only games available on linux were tux racer, battle for wesnoth, and a bunch of broken wine games with buggy text rendering. This is to say, I love PC gaming. But also I&#39;ve been a console gamer for almost as much time, I owned many consoles all my life and now I own a PS5, a switch, and even a steam deck (which I consider a console for the purpose of this post). </p> <p>On top of that, I&#39;m also a parent with a very active toddler. Most of my gaming time happens on the downtime, when my son is sleeping, or when I get 10 minutes breaks here and there throughout the day. This brings me to the main issue of this post: I really really really value the ability to jump in and out of games quickly as I often need to pause/suspend a game to go look after my son, and come back to it later to continue where I left off.</p> <p>This is a solved problem on co
