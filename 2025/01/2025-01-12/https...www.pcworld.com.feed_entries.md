<p>One of my favorite trends in desktop PC design for the last couple of years has been what we call “<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937700/2023s-biggest-desktop-pc-trend-the-war-on-cables.html">The War on Cables</a>,” wherein all the interior power and data cables are hidden on the backside of a case.
