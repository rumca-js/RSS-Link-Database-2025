For ex. studying math under the models or methods like backpropagation, word2vec or anything like these. In my path I&#39;m planning to do projects also. And I reckon I&#39;ll finish some important topics in 6months according to my plan. So if anyone interested pls dm me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I mostly run AI training and experiments on my PC and these experiments sometimes last multiple days non-stop and this machine keeps running 24/7. Do you think overclocking is required for my use case to get better performance? I don&#39;t want to end up bricking the GPU or end up reducing its lifespan as well. Can OC affect that? The reason Im asking this is because my GPU is ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 4090 Trinity and it has 3 fans on it. Ive noticed that for all my AI experiments the fans never go above 30% and the GPU temperature is also around 50 - 55°C. Since the GPU can handle higher temperatures and also there is the possibility of the fan going above 30%, I feel like I can possibly get more juice from GPU? What do you recommend, will it be a good idea?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTechVirgin"> /u/TheTechVirgin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteli

When machines automate a task that labor used to do, labor becomes less valuable.</p> <p>2.) AI will make machines that automate all tasks</p> <p>3.) Therefore, labor will lose all value.</p> <p>There are two good reasons to doubt this story:</p> <p>1.) 200+ years of automation hasn&#39;t reduced labor&#39;s value</p> <p>2.) Perfect substitutes for human intelligence aren’t new - we already trade with people far smarter than us.
