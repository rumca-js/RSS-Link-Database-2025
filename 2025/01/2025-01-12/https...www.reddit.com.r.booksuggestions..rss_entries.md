I’m curious about what books folks recommend that never get traction. </p> <p>Personally, I often find myself recommending Ginn Hale’s The Rifter. It’s an awesome fantasy epic spanning three books. It has an well developed fantasy world that doesn’t rely on medieval Europe as its foundation. The love story is very satisfying. And the world is populated with great and realized minor characters. It’s a book I think should be a modern classic, but it essentially unheard of. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hawnty"> /u/hawnty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzgcee/what_book_do_you_want_to_recommend_that_is_rarely/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzgcee/what_book_do_you_want_to_recommend_that_is_rarely/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, despite my age I very much enjoy a good children’s fantasy novel, I remember reading Warriors when the series was first coming out and then rereading in the past five years, I read Wings of Fire, I’ve read Keeper of The Lost cities and I’ve really enjoyed these series. I’ve read some more well known series’s too like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and Dune which I also enjoyed. Recently I’ve read The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, as well as Le Comte de Monte Cristo and I have fallen in love with these two books! The way the characters are written and how the story is paced in older books is just amazing. I figured if these books have existed for over a century and I haven’t found them to this point, I’m definitely missing something and there are probably so many more amazing books that will peak my interest, so please suggest some books to me! I think the only books that I don’t always enjoy are the ones with a heavy theme of roma

My new job has cemented this fear due to working with a lot of younger people, feeling socially out of place, and also just feeling a bit slower to pick things up and understand things in my new job. My low confidence and self esteem has now made me question my identity, style and path in life.</p> <p>I don’t mind self help or fiction or anything really about accepting growing older, or navigating significant changes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,<br/> I published my first eBooks a few days ago, but unfortunately, sales haven’t been going well. I was wondering if you have any ideas on how I can best promote them. The genre is Dark Fantasy, but since I haven’t been writing for very long, I’m starting to feel unsure if maybe it’s just not good enough, even though I find it exciting and really enjoyed writing it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Community_2454"> /u/No_Community_2454 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzbeg0/my_first_ebooks_are_not_selling_well_pls_help_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzbeg0/my_first_ebooks_are_not_selling_well_pls_help_i/">[comments]</a></span>

## Needing some help finding fantasy series that will keep me busy for some time

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Context - Hoping there’s no judgement here but I have gone most of my adult life without reading a single book (31M). I have always found myself too easily distracted and getting frustrated with myself for not retaining anything that was read, even when the topic was interesting. More recently it came to me while commuting to work that I’m just really tired of the literal brain rot that is currently most of the social media we consume.</p> <p>This lead me to giving reading a real honest try and I have been thoroughly enjoying it. I started with the Dune series solely off of enjoying the movies and I’m just about through the first book. Now I do know there are 5 more books in this series, I’m thinking I want to break up the stories and add other series in there as well. </p> <p>Realizing this is likely not too helpful, all that said I’m looking for really any series that has a very immersive world with great character building/arcs within this fiction

The book can be non-linear but doesn’t necessarily have to be. </p> <p>I am especially looking for episodic memoirs written by authors who are one or more of the following: BIPOC, LGBT+, disabled, neurodivergent, not a big celebrity. </p> <p>Thank you in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GrouchyCrow"> /u/GrouchyCrow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzbdde/looking_for_episodic_memoirs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzbdde/looking_for_episodic_memoirs/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Howdy, Reddit. I work at a school in Pacific Palisades, and my school burned down in the fire. About 50% of my students lost their homes. We are transitioning to distance learning and possibly a temporary rental space, but needless to say, everyone has been through a lot. </p> <p>I was planning to read the book, A Long Walk to Water with them for our next novel study, but if you’re unfamiliar, it’s a story about the Sudanese civil war and water issues. I feel it’s a little too heavy and grounded in real world trauma for my students at the moment. I’m looking for recommendations for books. </p> <p>I tend to like teaching books that have deeper philosophical ideas or literary qualities that make them stand out. The reading level of my students is roughly grade level and above. </p> <p>I’m open to any and all suggestions. Although I like teaching this age group, I don’t tend to read books leveled for them. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help! </p> <

## Subtle, slow-burn horror like Walter de la Mare, and E. Nesbit’s creepy short stories?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for the psychological kind you can solve like a puzzle, where you go back and put together little details that form a picture. “Hurst of Hurstcote” by Nesbit is a good example. I would rather analyze a narrative and figure out who the villain is, or who was murdered and is haunting the house, and so on. Being told directly takes the fun away, IMO.</p> <p>I greatly enjoyed “Your Tiny Hand is Frozen” by Robert Aickman; the second to last paragraph is about as chilling as it gets. Although I’m not sure there’s a solid answer to what was going on there with characters and events. The most I can find is reviewers who keep saying <span class="md-spoiler-text">it means Aickman hated telephones????
