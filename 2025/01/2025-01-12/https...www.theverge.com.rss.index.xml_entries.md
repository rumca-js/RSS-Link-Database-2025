  <p id="20iHfy">Apple may have settled on iPhone 17 Air as the name for the rumored skinny iPhone that’s expected this fall, reports <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Mark Gurman in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5?srnd=undefined">today’s <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>. He writes that the phone will be “a testing ground for future technologies,” including the tech that leads to the company’s first foldables.</p>

  <p id="QJbI79">It’s getting increasingly difficult to avoid AI when you open up your phone or laptop — as soon as I started this article in Google Docs, I was immediately offered some AI assistance to write it (which I didn’t take). And with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24272995/apple-intelligence-now-available-ios-18-1-mac-ipad">the rollout of Apple Intelligence</a>, that now applies to iPhones, iPads, and Macs, too.</p>

  <p id="fdUbE5">Las Vegas is punishingly dry. The arid winter air means I woke up on Day 3 of CES 2025 with a nosebleed, chapped lips, and ashy legs. This in spite of the fact I slathered myself with two pumps of a fermented bean essence, eye cream, moisturizer, and a lip mask. Staring at my face in the hotel mirror, I wonder if any of those products were doing what they’re supposed to — and if maybe, I should try something different.</p>
