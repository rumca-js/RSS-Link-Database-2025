For ex. studying math under the models or methods like backpropagation, word2vec or anything like these. In my path I&#39;m planning to do projects also.

Do you think overclocking is required for my use case to get better performance? I don&#39;t want to end up bricking the GPU or end up reducing its lifespan as well. Can OC affect that? The reason Im asking this is because my GPU is ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 4090 Trinity and it has 3 fans on it. Ive noticed that for all my AI experiments the fans never go above 30% and the GPU temperature is also around 50 - 55\u00b0C. Since the GPU can handle higher temperatures and also there is the possibility of the fan going above 30%, I feel like I can possibly get more juice from GPU? What do you recommend, will it be a good idea?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTechVirgin\"> /u/TheTechVirgin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteli",

Therefore, labor will lose all value.</p> <p>There are two good reasons to doubt this story:</p> <p>1.) 200+ years of automation hasn&#39;t reduced labor&#39;s value</p> <p>2.)

As some of you might already know I run a small, tiny, YouTube channel where I experiment with AI in a way that is supposed to simulate a future setting where we as humans/transhumans use it to create software and content for immediate use/consumption. Last week I took it upon myself to purchase all of the paid for tiers for the top three video services Hailuo, Haiper and Vidu in order to make initially a music video but it later became a trailer for a classic 90s anime film. I had seen other anime AI stuff on YT and was totally inspired to do but after a week of solidly burning through credits I wasn&#39;t getting what I really wanted. I managed with the help of a few videos to get something made. It&#39;s cool, there is a story but it was so hard to do and the end result isn&#39;t anywhere near as stunning as the other stuff I&#39;ve seen. So what&#39;s the secret?
