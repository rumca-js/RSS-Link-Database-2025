Something almost Pirates of a Caribbean, but it doesn\u2019t have to be exclusive to pirates! I\u2019m fine with anything fantasy, but I\u2019m looking more towards heist, mission, spy stuff even if it means it\u2019s taking place in a fantasy setting. </p> <p>Another thing that I\u2019m looking for on top of the adventure genre are WLW characters and WLW plots within the adventure book. </p> <p>Please let me know if any of you have any great recs that fit the description.

It\u2019s an awesome fantasy epic spanning three books. It has an well developed fantasy world that doesn\u2019t rely on medieval Europe as its foundation. The love story is very satisfying. And the world is populated with great and realized minor characters. It\u2019s a book I think should be a modern classic, but it essentially unheard of. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hawnty\"> /u/hawnty </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzgcee/what_book_do_you_want_to_recommend_that_is_rarely/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hzgcee/what_book_do_you_want_to_recommend_that_is_rarely/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve read some more well known series\u2019s too like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and Dune which I also enjoyed. Recently I\u2019ve read The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, as well as Le Comte de Monte Cristo and I have fallen in love with these two books! The way the characters are written and how the story is paced in older books is just amazing. I figured if these books have existed for over a century and I haven\u2019t found them to this point, I\u2019m definitely missing something and there are probably so many more amazing books that will peak my interest, so please suggest some books to me! I think the only books that I don\u2019t always enjoy are the ones with a heavy theme of roma",

When I was 14/15 so more or less 10 years ago I read this book or series about this really really cool assassin/female character who was very good at hiding and killing and basically was a force to be reckoned with. She has some adventures, one in the desert or in a forest, and then gets married with this pretty useless (elf? Hobbit) with curly hair and pretty short. I remember there were no sex scenes and i cant seem to find the title or anything. I think at the end of the book/series she passes or something bad happens to her. Any suggestions??
