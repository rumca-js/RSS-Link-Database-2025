I only downloaded about 5-7 plugins, and one of them was certainly a Trojan. While no one logged into my Steam account directly, it was still accessed by someone in Ukraine, who wrote dozens of spam messages to all my Steam friends. This all happened after I downloaded a VST called Modo Bass.</p> <p>Another important note: not only was my Steam account remotely accessed, but also my Reddit, email, and eBay accounts. Someone even attempted to purchase a gift card, which would have gone through if I had my bank account connected to eBay.</p> <p>I had to fully wipe my laptop multiple times to stop people from remotely accessing it, all of this happened after I downloaded Modo Bass from G-Meh by the way.</p> <p><strong>Another important note:</strong> I obviously don\u2019t have any substantial evidence to prove that G-Meh is a malicious and unsafe website.
