As always, around this time of the year, I will look at this topic from a broader angle to see the implications of this technology on our hobby and professional lives. It extends the video on \u201crules\u201d and shows how they are interwoven with Artificial Intelligence. As usual, I will stick to the implications on sensors and microcontrollers, and I hope you will get some useful insights for your decisions in 2025. And the project I will build will be \u201cfor the cat\u201d, as we say in German.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nSmokey's fountain: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oE0FU6V\nESP32-CAM: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_om7ZxIp\n\nCode: https://github.com/SensorsIot/Cat-Detector-with-ChatGPT-and-ESP32\nPlaylist with some wisdom: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3XBzmAj53RlUee7ikCs3NxUXuTkRRq02\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually af",
