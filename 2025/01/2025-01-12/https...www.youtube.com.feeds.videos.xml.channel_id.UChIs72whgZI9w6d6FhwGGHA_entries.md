The video card partners went off the rails last generation, and with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 Blackwell GPUs, they've continued the spiral of marketing inanity. Even still, in between all the marketing text, we can find some useful specs and information about upcoming GPU partner models. This video follows-up our series from the RTX 4090 launch by going over not only the entertaining absurdity of the partner video cards for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, but also some of the hard specs. We'll have our work cut out for us in January and February of 2025 -- lots of GPU benchmarking and reviews to do!
