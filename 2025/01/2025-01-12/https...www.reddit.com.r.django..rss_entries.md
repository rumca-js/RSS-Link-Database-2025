<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, For the past few days, I have been feeling unmotivated and unsure about what to build or how to develop my Django and programming skills. To address this issue, I have been spending my time researching challenges and contests. I came across a list of projects shared by Roadmap to help improve my backend skills. I have decided to start building an e-commerce website using the Django REST framework, and I would like to get positive reviews and votes for my project. Here is the <a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/ecommerce-api/solutions?u=6783ba4b70129741a83e8a22">link</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Garlic2165"> /u/Ok_Garlic2165 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hzza6s/seeking_feedback_and_support_for_my_django_rest/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hzza6s/seeking_feedback_and_support_for_my_django_rest/

Although that was c programming, but it give me a taste of joy. then through out my 1-4th sem, i choose Python, AI/ML as my generic elective subjects and build some good experience in it too.</p> <p>but that was not enough for me, so as i that time don&#39;t have any access to cs classes ( as i am in physics hons) i started taking youtube courses ( a free university ).<br/> i learn html, css, django, spend my time in building projects, got in touch with API&#39;s integrate my projects with Gemini API , that was the first time when i read any kind of documentation, i did projects on rendering out

Then when the post is saved it will look for images with that particular temporary id and assign the instance to them.</p> <p>I just want to know if this is the best solution as I don&#39;t like to blindly follow AI suggestions
