I already use RTSS with it limited to 96Hz and V-Sync off but still often I&#39;d get stuttering. But I&#39;ve found a fix that works for me across games (Witcher, Cyberpunk, Doom etc...) and that is to press Win + G and turn on the performance overlay. You can just select only fps and make the box super small and put it in the corner and voila, smooth gameplay. I&#39;m not sure why this works, but it does for me. I&#39;m on Windows 11 and have an AMD CPU + GPU. I thought I&#39;d share this with you all.

So i was curious if there is a game out there where you either ascend, descend or just move room to room killing enemies. I&#39;ve played Vampire Survivors and idk if that counts and i enjoyed it but i was more thinking about a game where you maybe play as a person who must rid some &#39;future companies mine shaft of native creatures, rioters, gangs and possibly other bad stuff&#39; and the entirety of the game is just picking and choosing weapons and you just kill stuff in a fiery passion. It doesn&#39;t require levels or upgrades or anything. I want a game where i don&#39;t have to follow a whole written out story or have to worry about special moves and equipment and so on.

First game in a decade that got me to play on PC - Dragon Age Veilguard/Hogwarts Legacy: solid games, but the combat was way too timing based for what I enjoy. I&#39;m not a Souls type or games that require specific timing on blocks/parrys/dodges. I prefer slower play such as... - Dragon Age Inquisition: lots of RPG elements and immersiveness, but not as much as Origins which was amazing. The combat and gameplay felt very natural and fluid on console however and the slower combat is much more what I&#39;m looking for than DAV or Hogwarts or Souls - Elder Scrolls games (recently ESO): again good mix of RPG elements and smoothness, though a bit light on RPG recently.
