<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember maybe 15 or 20 years ago there was a fun little game which was two player competitive multiplayer. It was kind of in the same vein as angry birds where you launched things from your platform to the other opponent&#39;s side. There was some levels with a blimp in the center that could be taken down after several shots. You had a few types of ammunition like a mortar, bazooka, a ray gun... I remember this was the game that popularized ASL. You say ASL at the beginning of every match to ask your opponents generic information. Do you remember what it was called? I&#39;m pretty sure it was a browser-based game at the time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RyderDraconis"> /u/RyderDraconis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hzxz5z/help_me_remember_a_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hzxz5z/help_me_

Any input on where to start with some of these would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Here’s my list so far:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Resident Evil / Silent Hill</strong> - Dead Space 2 got me excited to try some more horror combat games. I’m going to try the OGs before trying the remakes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mech games</strong> - Similarly, Titanfall 2 was so good that I feel like I slept on an entire genre that I could love. Maybe the Armored Core series?</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deck building games</strong> - People rave about Balatro and Slay the Spire so I want to see what all the fuss is about. They also look like great games for short play sessions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Real Time Strategy games</strong> -
