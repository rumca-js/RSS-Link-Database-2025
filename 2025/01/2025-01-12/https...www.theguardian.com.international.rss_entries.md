There had been 35 goals in the last ten meetings between these two great rivals and there were seven more in the final of the Spanish Super Cup. The only pity was that it happened in the wrong place. FC Barcelona had put four past Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu in October; now they went one better on their way to an extraordinary 5-2 victory, 5,000km away in Jeddah, a night when they played with two goalkeepers ending with a third, the injured captain Marc Andre ter Stegen, lifting the trophy.</p><p>Barcelona had finished a man down and started a goal down, Wojciech Szczęsny beaten early and sent off later, but ultimately it didn’t matter. Hansi Flick’s side were just too good. Exceptional in fact,

<p>Dreaming is vital to our mental health – and it is possible to use them for our own good</p><p>Dreams are pure emotional and cognitive gold. Those often surreal, fragmented images and plot lines that can instantly evaporate when we open our eyes, allow us not only to explore the themes and challenges of our day, but to step into the what-ifs of tomorrow.</p><p>Whether we remember our dreams or not, our brain and dreams are multi-tasking to the nth degree while we sleep. Together, they are shunting keeper memories into our memory bank, ditching others that don’t make the grade and strengthening positive emotions. They are weakening negative or traumatic ones, bolstering our stress resilience, cognitive function, problem-solving capabilities and our mental health. All of which explains the emotional rollercoaster that can come with sleep deprivation and insomnia (I’ve been there). Because when we’re sleep-deprived, we’re dream-deprived, robbed of those invaluable sleep-dependent per

<p>This provocative novel contains two narratives: the memoir of an activist starting a new life and the violent manifesto of a spy cop who knew her</p><p>Anna McCormick, as many people did, is discovering that the first pandemic lockdown is playing havoc with time. Becalmed in her deliberately fortress-like London home with her young adult son Paul, she is simultaneously under pressure – teaching primary school children on Zoom, maintaining her stockpile of tinned goods, attempting to communicate with her mother’s care home – and forced into unnatural, unwanted inaction. As a survivor of domestic abuse, and several other threats to her safety and sanity, she is aware of the immense prize – a sanctuary, a job, meaningful relationships – she has secured, but also of its precariousness. Amid these conditions of unbidden contemplation, she begins to write a sort of memoir.</p><p>So too does Buster, the shape-shifting, monstrous undercover cop who once infiltrated the OrKestrA, the “merr

<p>Psychologists say that singing, dancing and song preferences play a key role in the viability of romantic relationships</p><p>“What’s the one thing your readers should do to help them use music to find and catch the partner of their dreams?” asks Patrick Savage, a senior research fellow in psychology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. “Go to karaoke and sing a duet. Go and sing A Whole New World with Brad Kane and Lea Salonga. That’s the number one recommendation by science. Well, just by me. I don’t have data on this, but from my personal experience, that’s the best.”</p><p>Given that he is a musicologist, it is perhaps unsurprising that music is a key part of Savage’s relationship with his wife. But his experience with using music as a romantic tool is not unique. Love songs are found across cultures and despite not being a neat category they have historically been most popular – 67% of the top 40 tracks in America between 1960 and 2010 contained love themes.</p> <a h

<p>Kraf’s charming and challenging fourth and final novel, now published in the UK, is narrated by a New Yorker who experiences psychotic episodes</p><p>“I am glad I have the radiance. This time I am wiser,” begins Elaine Kraf’s 1979 novel – now published for the first time in the UK – in irresistibly intriguing style. The narrator is Ellen, an artist living on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where she regularly experiences periods of what she calls radiance, or what the rest of us would call psychosis, mental illness, or detachment from reality.</p><p>And what “the rest of us” think is part of the problem for Ellen, because the radiances make her happy and she is no threat to anybody. “Fools! No one likes anyone for what they really are.” So she becomes Esmeralda, self-styled princess of 72nd Street. “I am not one of those rulers who is never seen on the streets mingling with the common people.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/12/the-princess-of-72nd-street-by-e

It doesn’t take long to see the limits of this notion. It may be droll, for example, to serve strawberries on strawberry-shaped dishes, but they don’t taste better for it. Monet’s <em>Water Lilies</em> wouldn’t be improved by showing them against blotchy wallpaper in bright impressionist colours. You may similarly want architecture to complement rather than compete.</p><p>And so it is with ballet.

<p>‘Sir Queue Jumper’ for Sir Keir Starmer? Even Liz Truss would deserve better puns than this</p><p>The concept of a pun was stretched almost to breaking point a few days ago when a newspaper, on a report that the prime minister had been ushered to the front of a long line of people waiting for a toboggan ride, put the headline: “<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14245205/Sir-Queue-jumper-Keir-Starmer-booed-tourists-skips-three-hour-line-toboggan-ride-family-holiday-Madeira.html">Sir Queue Jumper</a>!” It’s really only the “Sir” that lets us know a pun is even being attempted. But, since the current prime minister is also a knight, it seems that “Sir Queue Jumper” is a humorous play on the phrase “Sir Keir Starmer”.</p><p>The urgent question we need to ask ourselves is: will this do? The newspaper wishes to say that he’s a queue jumper and hasn’t, for some reason, gone with the phrase “Keir Starmer is a queue jumper”. Perhaps the editorial team thinks it would be bet

<p><strong>British Library, London</strong><br>A letter from the French saint and a lethal shopping list are among the stars of a mind-bending show of the words, mystical visions and everyday lives of women from 1100 to 1500</p><p>What does hell smell like? At the British Library last week, I opened a small wooden door and inhaled a scent that was bitter and vegetal: a combination of sulphur and something that I didn’t dare to think about for too long so soon after breakfast. Ugh. To spend eternity breathing in this! Happily, though, a counter-stink was on hand. Before the devil had a chance to appear, I closed the door and opened another next to it. This time, my nose filled with the sweetness of honey. It wasn’t precisely heavenly; to be worldly just for a moment, I think you need Chanel or Guerlain for truly celestial perfumes. But it did make me smile. The things museum curators get up to when they’re trying to encourage time travel.</p><p>The horrible smell was inspired by the s

<p>Amid deepening debt and an onslaught by the president-elect, Labour must  calm the markets, then think big economically</p><p>It’s certainly not 2008, nor even Truss 2022, but the men and women who move the financial markets are suddenly darkly pessimistic. Some of the private emails and WhatsApp messages circulating last week matched any efforts by Cassandra. The mood has turned against Britain.</p><p>It is not one single thing, but a toxic mix. There is the prospect of a long period of stagflation, the consequence, as even the markets recognise, of 14 years of epic misgovernment. The problem now is partly that Labour does not have a plausible growth story, partly that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is painted as having an economic tin ear that douses capitalist animal spirits, and partly because Trump’s arrival has exposed just how dependent an indebted, economically wounded Britain is on the kindness of strangers.

But the real blame lay with the England batters, who played in classic “Jonball” fashion (the aggressive style to which coach Jon Lewis lends his name), lacking the patience required to see off Australia’s world-class attack.
