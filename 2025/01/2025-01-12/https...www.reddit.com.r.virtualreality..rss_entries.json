As far as I&#39;m aware Cyberpunk can accept multiple control inputs at the same time, and I&#39;ve seen people talk about mapping mouse controls to their gyro, so I figure it may be possible to combine head tracking via the Luke Ross mod with gyro... Maybe? Than again, it may require a semi-free-floating aim crosshair (I can only imagine the nausea if gryo controls move your entire field of view) but it may still be better than gaze aim.

And it\u2019s pretty good, but I haven\u2019t been playing vr much lately and I\u2019ve been thinking of getting back into it and playing some games for fitness this year. Is it worth the price tag to upgrade to the 3S?</p> <p>Edit: thank you everyone for all the input, I will instead save up for the 3, instead of \u201cupgrading\u201d to the 3S.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Phony-Phoenix\"> /u/Phony-Phoenix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hzicaz/is_it_worth_it_to_upgrade_to_the_3s/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hzicaz/is_it_worth_it_to_upgrade_to_the_3s/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;m currently using my brothers original HTC vive - it&#39;s quite old, one of the first vr headsets to come out - the screen quality isn&#39;t the greatest and it&#39;s too bulky for my head. It constantly slips down my face and the Velcro to make it tighter is tearing away from the headset. It also commonly disconnects because the wires are bent in some places - So I was wondering if yall had any recommendations for a new VR Headset I really want to have leg tracking and something not super expensive. But if there&#39;s also a way to upgrade my brothers VR set let me know. Is there a way to get a new headset but still be able to use the old base stations so it&#39;s less expensive? he has recently new hand controllers I believe so I would only need the headset if I&#39;m able to use the old base stations. I&#39;m new to vr so I would love some recommendations or ideas on how to make my experience better! Thank you all for your time, I gr",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have an opportunity to upgrade my graphics card from a RTX 3060 Ti to higher end card in the next couple of weeks. I&#39;ve been with Nvidia for a long time, but their prices seem out of hand at the moment...for the price of a new RTX 4070 Super I can get a new Radeon 7900XT. I&#39;d kinda rather spend the extra money on upgrading to a decent 1440p monitor to go along with my new card. But 12GB VRAM doesn&#39;t seem like enough when I already need to lower settings to keep within 8GB (especially with VR titles).</p> <p>How much worse is the Quest 3 on Radeon in 2025? I see mixed reviews--some people still swear by Nvidia, some people say its fine now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/generalmx\"> /u/generalmx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hzctky/how_much_worse_is_the_quest_3_on_radeon/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/v",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi!</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking about getting a Meta Quest 3. Will I have a good gaming experience with a RTX 3060 Ti + R5 3600? I&#39;m sticking to 1080p resolution and 60fps, if that\u2019s sufficient for VR, I didn&#39;t find a benchmark with that GPU so I have no idea how many fps it can get. If you have a similar spec, please share that info.</p> <p>I won\u2019t be playing performance-heavy games, just titles like Phasmophobia, Minecraft (with VR mod), Elite Dangerous, and HL Alyx. </p> <p>Will using 1080p resolution with Quest 3 be a bad experience because of the resolution I&#39;ll be playing? Like blurry, choppy, idk. I&#39;ll upgrade my PC in the future. Or should I upgrade my PC first before getting that VR headset? Would you recommend any other VR headset based on my PC specs?</p> <p>Thanks!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pixel_Nuts\"> /u/Pixel_Nuts </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
