Schluter shower pan tips…I have to customize this pan. The first step is to cut the 3/4 inch perimeter off the short side. Then I trim the length. I do the exact same thing for the width. I use KERDI-FIX (an adhesive) to bond the perimeters back to the pan. This gives me a flat perimeter and helps with the wall tile installation. Many thanks to Schluter for providing materials for my client’s custom shower remodel 👍🏽🔥#schlutersystems #showerdesign #diy #diyrenovation #homereno
