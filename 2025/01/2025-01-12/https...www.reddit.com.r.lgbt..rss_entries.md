I&#39;m very introverted while she&#39;s the complete opposite. My mother is very right wing, and I used to see my sister agree a lot with a vast majority of points she was making, even lgbtphobic ones. When I was 15, I came out to her as bi ; I don&#39;t really know why, but I just wanted a family member to know since I would never tell my mom. She told me it&#39;s okay, and responded that she&#39;s bi herself, but &quot;would never date women as they&#39;re way too annoying&quot; ; at that point I assumed she wasn&#39;t really bi and was just saying it for whatever reasons. I never really talked about those topics anymore with her, and we slowly drifted apart as we were no longer living together.</p> <p>Fast forward to now : I got kicked out by my mother in september after a dumb fight, and I&#39;ve been

It&#39;s like I naturally have a tendency to want to avoid them, I guess being around them makes me feel insecure about myself, and scared that other people will associate me with them (maybe because I&#39;m also lgbt).
