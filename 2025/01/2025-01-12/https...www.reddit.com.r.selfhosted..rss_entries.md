<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Specifically, icloudpd (downloads your apple photos as you take them with the photos app, moves them to your immich folder, and deletes them from icloud). It is a CLI tool, so I currently have to create a screen session when the computer boots up, attach to it, run the command, detach, and then do the same for my wife&#39;s icloud in a second screen session. What is the way to do this automatically? Is it docker? Tmux? Making it a &quot;service&quot; that runs with systemctl ? It just needs to run at boot, and be able to &quot;attach&quot; so I can view the logs, pause it, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/devshore"> /u/devshore </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hzz8gd/what_is_the_correct_way_to_run_a_selfhost_service/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hzz8gd/what_is_the_correct_way_to_run_a_selfhost_serv

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;ve kept most of the components of my previous PC (which is reasonably powerful) and I&#39;m thinking of buying a different case and turning it into some kind of living room TV entertainment system both for streaming shows/movies and perhaps for arcade/emulator games. In addition, I&#39;d like to also use it as a home server and make use of the various self hosted apps. Is this feasible, are the computer/OS setups that handle both? Can this be done on a single generic operating system, or does it require virtualisation and separate instances? Of course I&#39;m also concerned about the electricity bill.</p> <p>I currently dabble a bit in self hosted, I have an old DS218j NAS, which I host a few things like Plex (looking to replace with jellyfin) on, but overall it&#39;s a very limited device and not suitable for most self hosted apps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SpaceToad"> /u/Sp

I started the installation process, made a username and password, set my country of origin and language, but then when I get to the Setting up remote access page, it will just load and buffer and not go on to the next page.

So far I have tried both nginx and caddy, and neither have worked, both having issues with getting a certificate. None of the solutions found online worked for either. I have a domain, I have ports 80 and 443 forwarded through my at&amp;t router, and both ports opened on my server&#39;s firewall (firewalld). I have an A record in cloudflare pointing the domain to my external IP with proxy off.</p> <p>When I use <a href="https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/">https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a> to test 80 and 443, both are closed, which I assume is why nothing is working. However I have forwarded both on my router in the exact same way I have forwarded other ports that still work. Could it be that at&amp;t blocks these specific ports? I have tried literally everything and absolutely nothing works. Any help would be greatly appreciated!<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says, if you put expose something like frigate with no auth screen behind a tunnel with access policy for specific email addresses, is there a way for malicious parties to gain access still (without compromising email accounts on the access whitelist). I understand the tunnels basically act as a MITM for cloudflare so let&#39;s assume that isn&#39;t an issue in this instance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HappyXD"> /u/HappyXD </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hzaz8o/is_it_safe_to_not_have_a_login_page_for_a_service/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hzaz8o/is_it_safe_to_not_have_a_login_page_for_a_service/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I decided to switch away from Notion and self-host an <a href="https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync">obsidian-livesync service </a>but I found that the documentation of the project, while pretty comprehensive, is written in pretty bad English and doesn&#39;t provide a ready to use official container. As such and mostly for myself, I created a container which automatically configures CouchDB by downloading and parsing the official install script provided by the obisidian-livesync maintainer and wrote a blog post explaining how to self-host the container.</p> <p>Here is the container source: <a href="https://github.com/oleduc/docker-obsidian-livesync-couchdb">https://github.com/oleduc/docker-obsidian-livesync-couchdb</a></p> <p>Here is the container on hub.docker.io: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/oleduc/docker-obsidian-livesync-couchdb">https://hub.docker.com/r/oleduc/docker-obsidian-livesync-couchdb</a></p> <p>And finall

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I‚Äôm relatively new to the self-hosting space, and I‚Äôm currently using Proxmox on my server where I have five VMs set up: Nextcloud, Nginx Proxy Manager, Gitea, DocMost, and I plan to add a few more in the future.</p> <p>My main concern is securing the entire setup. I initially thought using OPNsense would be a good solution, but I find it quite complicated, and every time I try configuring it, I end up causing issues that require me to remove it. I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to best secure my server, particularly in terms of setting up a firewall and ensuring that everything is as secure as possible.</p> <p>I‚Äôve been struggling with this for a while and haven‚Äôt been able to find a setup that works well. Is there a more straightforward way to secure my Proxmox setup, or should I be relying on its built-in firewall features? Any suggestions or recommended scenarios would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently have frigate setup on my server (running Ubuntu server) along with home assistant. I have a monitor connected to my server, currently it just shows the Ubuntu login screen. Is it possible to utilize the monitor to continuously show the frigate web ui so that I can have a quick glance at all cameras like how all the DVR&#39;s do.</p> <p>I know one way to get this done is to install the desktop ui onto the server version of Ubuntu but I wanted to know if there&#39;s a better way of doing this as I only need it to show the web ui of frigate and nothing else.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/borkode"> /u/borkode </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hz9oo9/show_frigate_ui_on_monitor_connected_to_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hz9oo9/show_frigate_ui_on_monit
