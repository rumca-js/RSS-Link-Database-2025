<p>Colour-coded output from smartwatch device would be easy for public to read</p><p>They remain some of the most complex diagnostic procedures carried out by doctors. To take an electrocardiogram, or ECG, they first have to attach 10 or more electrodes to a patient’s chest, arms and legs to measure the heart’s electrical activity. Then, once these signals have been recorded, a cardiologist has to interpret them to determine if a person has a particular heart ailment.</p><p>It is a life-saving technology – but a complicated, expensive one. However, UK scientists now believe they could soon overcome these limitations by developing devices which will allow patients to take their own detailed ECGs at home and be provided with easily interpreted diagnoses about the state of their hearts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/12/at-home-ecgs-will-detect-early-heart-issues-and-save-thousands-say-doctors">Continue reading...</a>

Her decision to warn Keir Starmer that refusing a fresh inquiry could prompt speculation about a “cover-up” was the kind of political gamble they had expected her to be willing to take.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/tories-back-badenochs-risky-call-
