I&#39;m currently using spotify, but lyrics works on only some songs for me, and I find it a bit too glitchy for what it once was. I was searching out of curiosity for streaming apps like Apple Music or Tidal, but I learned that the first one is server based and the second one is patched. Anyone has apps that DON&#39;T rely/are based on YouTube Music like RiMusic ecc...? I tried them, didn&#39;t like them at all.

I primarily have been using <a href=\"http://viprow.nu\">viprow.nu</a> for streaming and the website loads perfectly fine, but when I go to play the streams, the videos just stay on the loading image and won&#39;t play. I can stream on my home connection using my phone on the same site.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried using a VPN, and that sometimes works but still has most of the same issues.

Internet connection is very good 100+ mbs, devices are just showing thier age. Stream work fine on my laptop which leads me to believe it&#39;s the devices themselves. Stream doesn&#39;t need to be HD, I&#39;m okay with accepting some drawbacks to quality just for a smooth stream.
