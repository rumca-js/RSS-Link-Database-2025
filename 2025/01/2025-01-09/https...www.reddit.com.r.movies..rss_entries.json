This is something I could admittedly do better at. Specifically, there are two monologues in the film that emphasize &quot;you never know this is the last time you&#39;ll do X.&quot; </p> <p>I enjoyed the movie, its themes, and peformances. I was getting ready for bed and thinking about the film in my mind. Maybe 15 minutes after the movie had ended, our baby monitor goes off. I walked into the nursery to replace the pacifier and soothe my kid back to sleep. Then, I connect the dots that this could be the last time I have this kind of moment. I started to weep and really reflect on enjoying these experiences of parenthood. I&#39;m genuinely grateful that the movie made me consider this more closely. </p> <p>Has anyone else watched and not had an outward response to it intially, but late",

It could be a brutal murder, a cold and emotionless decision, or an act so heartless it defies what normal people would find acceptable. For example, Amon Goth constructing the concentration camp and mercilessly killing the engineer who tried to explain an issue is a powerful display of such evil.

Sigourney Weaver was smoking hot in the movie and delivers some phenomenal jokes. Tim Allen is at his peak. Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn\u2019t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he\u2019s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too. </p> <p>What I love about this movie is that it\u2019s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. </p> <p>Some of my favorites lines in this movie:</p> <p><em>lands on ship</em> \u2026\u2026.Aaaahhhhhhhhhh</p> <p>Wait! Don\u2019t open that! It\u2019s an alien planet!!! Is there air?!
