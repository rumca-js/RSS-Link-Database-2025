So I remember the MC was half human and half alien, and his species was kinda intelligent. His friend comes over and presents him with some super impossible video game level but he solves it flawlessly cuz its designed like some telescope his people invented and his uncle finds him to take him to that planet because his alien father went on some mission and is somehow still alive after his entire crew died. Another main detail was that humans weren&#39;t contacted because way back in history humans roamed space and they had crazy super strength and dominated galaxies like gods. But (I don&#39;t quite remember how) they were defeated and banished them to Earth because it rid them of their powers.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys,</p> <p>Does anyone have any fantasy recommendations for books like <strong>The Serpents of Arakesh (or the entire quartet for that matter) by V.M. Jones, Deltora Quest by Emily Rodda, or the Rowan of Rin books</strong>? (I have read <strong>Finders Keepers and The Three Doors</strong> books and own, but am yet to read most of, <strong>Rondo</strong>). I have also read and adore Everworld by K.A. Applegate.</p> <p>I have been hankering for this sort of fantasy and I love those sorts of quest-based books, often with puzzles. I enjoy the sense of wonder and enchantment I get from reading these old books</p> <p>Ideally I would like some newer middle grade or adult books, as older children&#39;s books tend to be out of print. But anything you can recommend is great.</p> <p>Please don&#39;t recommend the <strong>Wayward Children series</strong> - I couldn&#39;t get into them at all.</p> <p>Manga/webcomics are also fine.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</",

However there are some issue with Wind and Truth that stop it from being what could\u2019ve been the best Stormlight book to date. First of all the humor. I know I\u2019ll sound like a stick in the mud but most of the humor in this book is deeply unfunny, and often distracting in my opinion. The mental health stuff is also unfortunately another thing that holds it back. I love that Sanderson talks about mental health in his books but I felt like this book had characters deal with their emotions in a way that",

I came across a saga of, I think I remember, three books; Super similar to Game of Thrones. The protagonist was a girl, I think the daughter of a king; that in true Arya style she liked to go hunting instead of what are assumed to be &quot;women&#39;s things.&quot; The girl was an archer, and in the world where the story takes place there was a wall of fire that separated civilization from monsters. In Spanish they called the wall Las Flames (I always understood that it was a poor translation of Flames, an English word...) </p> <p>If anyone remembers the name of the books or is familiar with what I&#39;m telling you, I would appreciate a response!
