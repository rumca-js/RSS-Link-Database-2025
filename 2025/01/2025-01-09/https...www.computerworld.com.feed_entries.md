<p>Researchers at Google Deepmind and Stanford University have concluded that a two-hour interview is sufficient to create a realistic AI copy with the same personality as the interviewee.</p>



<p>In an experiment, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,052 people were interviewed</a> using a questionnaire that addressed everything from personal life events to opinions about society. A digital AI copy was then created and when a new round of questions was asked, it answered the same as its human counterpart in 85% of cases.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619032/digital-twin-tech-is-twice-as-g

<p>Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vehemently denied</a> that it ever abused recordings of Siri requests by using those records for marketing, ad sales, or any of the other creepy nonsense we’re being forced to tolerate with other connected devices.</p>



<p>The company’s denial follows a recent $95 million settlement concerning a widely reported sequence of events when it became known that the company had <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1671452/apple-s-shock-siri-surveillance-demands-a-swift-response.html">human contractors grading people’s spoken Siri requests</a>.

<p>Recently, I was asked a question I haven’t heard in several years: Can you manage Apple devices without using MDM?</p>



<p>The technical answer is yes. You can use configuration profiles and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1616502/mac-enrollment-simplified-apple-configurator-ios.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1616502/mac-enrollment-simplified-apple-configurator-ios.html">Apple Configurator</a> to do this.</p>



<p>But you really shouldn’t try that approach. With mobile device management (MDM) vendors licensing their software for as little as $1 per device or user per month, MDM should be the go-to option for all but those on the tiniest o

<p>A federal judge in San Francisco has ruled that a privacy lawsuit against Google, alleging the company improperly collected personal data from mobile devices, can proceed.</p>



<p>Chief Judge Richard Seeborg dismissed Google’s argument that it had sufficiently informed users about its Web & App Activity settings and obtained their consent for tracking, paving the way for a possible trial in August.</p>



<p>The lawsuit accuses Google of intercepting and saving browsing histories without user consent, even after tracking settings were disabled.</p>



<p>Judge Seeborg noted that reasonable users could view Google’s data practices as “highly offensive,” given the ambiguity in its disclosures a
