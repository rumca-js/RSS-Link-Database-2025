        "description": "Jimmy Carter's four years in the White House were largely defined by an event that took place halfway through his term.    <br><br>On November 4th, 1979 Iranian college students took over the US Embassy in Tehran, and took 52 Americans hostage.<br><br>For the next 444 days, the Carter administration tried to secure the hostages' release. In April, 1980 they even commissioned a rescue mission that ended in failure. <br><br>While Carter was trying to end the hostage crisis, he was also campaigning for a second term. A year to the day after the Americans were taken hostage, Ronald Reagan beat Carter in a landslide.<br><br>The hostage crisis played a key role in Carter's defeat. <br><br>The Iranian Hostage crisis helped doom Jimmy Carter's presidency, but for some of the people he helped free, he was a hero.  <br><br>For sponsor-free episodes of <em>Consider This,</em> sign up for C<em>onsider This+</em> via Apple Podcasts or at <a href=\"http://plus.npr.org/\">plus.npr.org</a><br><br>Emai",
