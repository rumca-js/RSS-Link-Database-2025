        "description": "Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at the most leaked console of all time, the Nintendo Switch 2. In the last two weeks I've seen so much of this system leaked that I'm confident it can now be manufactured from a third party well before it's official release. In all seriousness it looks like a decent upgrade to the switch and a good showcase for handheld gaming. Thanks for watching!\nLike, Comment and Subscribe for more videos!",
