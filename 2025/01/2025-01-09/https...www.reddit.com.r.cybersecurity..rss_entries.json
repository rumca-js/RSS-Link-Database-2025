I was diagnosed with chrons disease a while back now and I have been toughing it out while I&#39;ve been learning python and general cybersecurity skills. How to use Wireshark, nmap, navigating linux and windows powershell, AD, etc etc. Unfortunately, having chrons means that I&#39;m not really supposed to be in the sun for extended periods. Hence the career pivot. </p> <p>My plan of action as of now is to get Network+, Security+, and CySA+ while continuing to learn scripting in python and also learning ethical hacking and SOC through hackthebox and tryhackme. Tryhackme has definitely been the easier of the two but I feel like it helped me grasp a lot of beginner concepts.</p> <p>So, is all of this effort for nothing? Most of the posts i read about the cybersecurity landscape are bleak at best in terms of finding a job if you&#39;re new to the field. I guess I sh",

My manager has advised me to do the EC-Council CEH but as I checked it would cost a lot for my current state.</p> <p>Now I did a little bit of research (and in this subreddit) and found out that CEH is not greatly recommended and most people advise against it. I wouldn&#39;t mind paying for the training but since it doesn&#39;t have a great reputation I am not so persuaded to do so. I saw some recommendations about Security+ which found interesting.</p> <p>Does anyone know the process for this?(how can I get trained, apply get certified?)
