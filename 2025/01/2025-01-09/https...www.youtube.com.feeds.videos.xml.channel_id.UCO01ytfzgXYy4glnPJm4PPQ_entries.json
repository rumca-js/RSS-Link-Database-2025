        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the city of Los Angeles is going up in flames. The Left claims it\u2019s a product of \u201cclimate change,\u201d but that\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to talk about the real cause, which is incompetence\u2014if not outright sabotage\u2014by the Democratic leaders of LA and California. Also, Joe Biden finally admits that he actually may not have been capable of serving a second term. A new study finds that vegans are often depressed and miserable\u2014I didn\u2019t need a study to tell me that. And, a Hollywood actor goes on Bill Maher\u2019s podcast and tries to defend sex changes for kids. It doesn\u2019t go well.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:30 Opening\n01:52 - 26:02 The Real Reason LA Is Burning \u2014 And It\u2019s Not Climate Change\n27:33 - 28:53 Biden Is Asked If He Would Have The Vigor For Another Term\n28:54 - 38:13 People Are Spending An Increasing Amount Of Time Alone\n38:14 - 45:02 1.2 Million Potentially Unsafe Elderly Drivers Are Still On The Roads\n45:03 - 48:10 Study Shows Vegans Could Be More Depressed",
