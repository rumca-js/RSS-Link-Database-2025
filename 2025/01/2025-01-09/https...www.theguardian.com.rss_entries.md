<p>Five living presidents gathered at the service in Washington. They were a reminder of how much has changed in US politics</p><p>Heavy with honours, attended by all living US presidents, and swathed in public affection, Jimmy&nbsp;Carter received a solemn state funeral on Thursday&nbsp;on the kind of cold and crystalline January&nbsp;day at&nbsp;which Washington DC’s climate can excel. Within hours, though, the 39th US president’s remains were interred&nbsp;in a private ceremony alongside his wife Rosalynn, in the shadow of the modest house they built in 1961 in Plains, Georgia, where Mr Carter was born more than a century ago, and where he died at the&nbsp;end of December.</p><p>This sharp juxtapositions of Mr Carter’s final day in the world’s eye were somehow appropriate. He made his home in Washington for the four years of his presidency, but his roots and heart were always in Georgia. His manifest personal decency and lack of Beltway experience made him the “not-Nixon” that the

This was one evening just before Christmas and I had somewhere to be.

The poor chap with the trolley looked at me and said nothing. His hands had a tremor about them. “Enfield?” I asked. He just stared at me. If he really had wanted to get to Enfield, far north London, by bus, from where we were in far west London, he was in for a very long night indeed.</p><p>Wondering if his English wasn’t good, I tried every other language I could muster.

<p>Today’s rumours have themselves a new spot</p><p>With two left-footed right wingers out in Bukayo Saka and Ethan Nwaneri, Arsenal are in the market for another. Mohamed Salah might be a little too ambitious, even with the Egyptian’s current contract situation but <strong>Bryan Mbeumo</strong> would fit the bill nicely, although Brentford would be loathe to let their talisman go halfway through the season. A summer move might be more likely, with Mbeumo’s contract due to expire at the end of next season in June 2026.</p><p>One of the most predictable things about Nottingham Forest’s unlikely charge up the table is that the big wigs come knocking for their talent, even at this early stage. <strong>Ola Aina</strong>, Forest’s lightning-fast and versatile full-back, is on the hitlist for Manchester City.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/09/football-rumours-arsenal-in-for-mbeumo-everton-target-mourinho">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wayne Rooney’s exit was a reminder of how common the fly-on-the-wall club documentary has become. The age of perpetual content is upon us, and it is viciously uninteresting</p><p>Won’t someone think of the streaming platforms? Wayne Rooney’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/31/wayne-rooney-leaves-plymouth-by-mutual-consent-after-seven-months?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">departure from Plymouth Argyle</a>, after seven months and a winless run that left the club bottom of the Championship, not only suggests the former England star’s managerial career has reached its end – it’s also a signal of how contentious the fly-on-the-wall documentary has become in modern football. Rooney was the driving force behind Plymouth’s announcement last November that it would produce a behind-the-scenes documentary about the club’s battle to stay in the Championship. This was a scheme cooked up in the fires of the post-Welcome to Wrexham content jamboree, which has made seemingly ever

<p>This political satire of insurrection and propaganda during the civil war, which is thought to have cost the author his life, gets an English translation at last</p><p>Oromay begins as it means to go on, at hurtling speed. A television journalist wakes late, with 20 minutes to catch a plane. And not just any plane: a plane carrying most of the leadership of Ethiopia. Tsegaye has hardly rubbed the sleep from his eyes when he finds himself in first class, receiving orders. There is to be an all-out push to bring the northern province of Eritrea into line with the revolution. He is in charge of hearts and minds, which must be changed. At once.</p><p>Oromay is set in the first months of 1982, seven years after emperor Haile Selassie was killed by a military junta led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, who by then had eliminated almost all opposition. A security agent in Oromay describes Eritrea immediately after the coup: beatings, jailings, extra-judicial killings, “corpses in the streets of
