<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>All the sites listed on the megathread have been great, yet recently they all buffer a few minutes into the film. I stream on firefox or google on my Omen 2024 Laptop, with the recommended extensions installed (ublock origin, privacy badger). I have an excellent wired internet connection and all my drivers are updated. </p> <p>Anyone experiencing recent buffing lately or have any solutions I can try? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rexconn"> /u/Rexconn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hwz6xo/buffering/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hwz6xo/buffering/">[comments]</a></span>
