<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently a sample of the “fog” droplets were lab tested. It turns out it contained a gram-negative bacteria, serratia marcescens. It causes the pink mold you find in damp environments. This bacteria can cause urinary tract infections (UTls), respiratory infections, wound infections, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, endocarditis, and ocular infections. That may not be the case in all of the foggy areas, but it&#39;s interesting, just the same.</p> <p><strong><em>This is a developing story, stay tuned for updates while I investigate more</em></strong></p> <p>SOURCE COMING SOON. Right now the person who got it tested is majorly freaked out and wished they never had it tested and posted on the internet. The person is currently not in their usual place. Phone off and went into ghost mode. Told no one they were leaving, NO ONE, not even me. And im not even close to this person, we have a “friend of a friend of a friend”… but it’s a person I trust 100%. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So...this place has been pretty quiet about the recent very globalist messaging coming from Trump and Elon. I know you guys hate Russian conspiracy, but why is no one asking why Putin is surprisingly quiet about America attempting to purchase Greenland and Panama (two very financially lucrative shipping lanes)? He&#39;s at war with Ukraine right now just because they wanted NATO membership, and claimed it was American Imperialism, but the annexation of Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the Panama Canal.....he&#39;s been pretty god damn quiet. Trumps actually shit talked almost all of our allies and threatened them with economic warfare if they don&#39;t submit to us, but has said nothing about Putin in poor light. Russia actually seems to be using Trumps recent globalist turn, to justify the invasion of Ukraine. There&#39;s your psyop.....normalizing a new age of conquering nations through social media, economic warfare, misinformation, rigged elections

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The term &quot;carbon footprint&quot; was popularized in 2005 by BP (British Petroleum).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>1- right before Trump entering office 2- Diddy recently going down/Ellen/all of fucking Hollywood for fucks sake 3- now the the fires are going straight for Hollywood 4- actual conspiracy now - what if there is tons of evidence about the dark dark Hollywood ?? They just straight up manipulate the weather? Drones? and burn it all down. My wife and I literally talked two weeks ago about something “big” coming before Trump takes office. Guarantee many of your guts were the same way. Call me crazy, I don’t really care. I’ve been following this for stuff for years and I call bull shit. </p> <p>There’s so much more I could say, but it’s not even worth it. You either believe it’s all a lie like us or you think we’re fucking coo coo. All love. Stay safe everyone. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GoatyMcGoaterson01"> /u/GoatyMcGoaterson01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comme
