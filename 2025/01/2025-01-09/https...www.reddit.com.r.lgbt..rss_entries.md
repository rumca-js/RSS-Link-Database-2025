## misgendering in the workplace

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I have a transgender coworker who recently came out to everyone a couple months ago.</p> <p>Yesterday, I was having a conversation with said coworker and my boss when my boss misgendered them (it didn’t seem malicious, it seemed like a genuine slip up but they didn’t correct themselves). My coworker didn’t correct my boss either, and in general they are not very outspoken &amp; don’t strike me as the type of person to correct someone during conversation. So, my question is: is it my place to speak up &amp; correct other people when they (accidentally or otherwise) misgender my coworker in front of my coworker? Or should I stay quiet to allow my coworker the space to correct people if they want? I don’t want to stand there &amp; do nothing &amp; have my coworker watch as no one stands up for them if they’re not feeling up to doing it themselves, but I also don’t want to infringe on their empowerment or make them uncomfortable.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay, so I’m a writer. And I am writing a book. I’m not going to go into the minute details of this book, but let’s just say that the protagonist is a lesbian woman and the deuteragonist is a gay man. And they are married</p> <p>Basically, it’s set in a futuristic-feudalistic style kingdom, and the gay man is the current Emperor. Unfortunately, he’s also a “false-blood” - unrelated to the line of the first Emperor - and therefore considered “not a real Emperor”</p> <p>Thus, to legitimize his reign, he needs to marry the last remnant of the first Emperor’s bloodline - the protagonist, a lesbian woman. And that’s the backstory for the plot</p> <p>In the narrative, their relationship is treated more sibling-like than anything else, with them using IVF for their children - bloodline and all that - and staying in separate chambers</p> <p>But when I showed it to one of my friends, he said that it was “too positive” of a depiction of a forced marriage, and
