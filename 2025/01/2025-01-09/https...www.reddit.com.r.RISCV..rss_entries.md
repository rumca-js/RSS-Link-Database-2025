<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow people</p> <p>I have to make a project work (&quot;Maturitätsarbeit&quot;, makes up (a small) part of the evaluation to decide whether one can study at university in Switzerland or not) starting in March that takes roughly 7 months and am now searching for a topic. Always have I been interested in learning how a computer works, and I plan to write a (really) simple OS* for QEMU and the VisionFive2 to get a better overview over the functionality of computers. I am especially interested in RISC-V because it seems to be easier / more intuitive than x86_64 (no weird legacy stuff), RISC-V is relatively new which makes it in itself more interesting to look at, and lastly I like the concept of open source.</p> <p>The problem is that &quot;making an OS&quot; isn&#39;t really a topic. Also, the &quot;Maturitätsarbeit&quot; has to be a written project or an art project. So the OS alone wouldn&#39;t suffice. My tutor advised me to find a topic or q
