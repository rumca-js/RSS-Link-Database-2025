Ngl, it was harder than I thought it would be. Not because it\u2019s a hard game, but bc the pogo mechanic just isn\u2019t consistent enough to guarantee you\u2019re going to hit an enemy or avoid spikes. Maybe it\u2019s much easier on Easy, but on Normal it just felt too wonky to get through levels consistently without taking damage. So it took me a couple hours of attempts haha. Still, it\u2019s def a fun game! Just the right amount of silly, cute, and fun to play. Since I don\u2019t want to spend crazy money on DuckTales 2 for NES, I got a Famicom copy. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t require too much reading lol. Def recommend this one though. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

Instead of replacing it, thinking of buying a Raspberry Pi and adding a bunch of games (SNES and other systems) to that. I remember a co-worker at a previous job had one of these. His Pi had a large number of games, multiple systems, with an easy-to-navigate main menu. What&#39;s a good starting point to building something like this? Would it be better to buy some type of a package or download all of the games myself? Just looking for a general overview or a link that would point me in the right direction, not looking for anything detailed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rick7624\"> /u/rick7624 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hx2zxv/how_to_build_a_raspberry_pi_with_hundreds_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hx2zxv/how_to_build_a_raspb",
