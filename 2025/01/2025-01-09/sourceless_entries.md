## How ancient flying reptiles ruled the skies: Study uncovers pterosaur tail structures that enhanced flight capabilities

Scientists have long puzzled over how pterosaurs became the first vertebrates to master flight. Some pterosaur species, such as the Quetzalcoatlus were the largest known animals to ever take to the skies, with wingspans of over ten meters (on par with military aircraft like the Spitfire). My team's new study may help solve the evolutionary mystery, revealing how a vane on the tip of their tails may have helped these ancient animals fly more efficiently. Our findings are published in the journal eLife.

Like workers at a factory or office, proteins in a cell must be in the right department to do their jobs. But scientists have yet to fully map the cell's organization, much less determine how these cellular "employees" may be reassigned in a time of crisis or change. A hostile takeover by a virus, for example, can send a cell's proteins to new stations, from which they may either serve the pathogen's aims or help the cell as it attempts to resist the infection.
