We are also four brothers who never get to meet up so recently I decided to start a board gaming group so we could all spend a bit of time together / have some fun away from our busy lives. Everyone in the group is fairly board game literate and love all things sci-fi / horror related. </p> <p>The main aim is to find a game that can keep us all interested whilst providing those moments of pain / fun that you only get when something goes wrong for your nearest and dearest :)</p> <p>I&#39;ve narrowed it down to either - Resident Evil: The Board Game (With the Directors Cut Expansion) or should I wait for the Pledge Manager to reopen and get OG Nemesis Core Pledge plus the Medic Character Expansion?</p> <p>Any help would be gratefully appreciated.</p> <p>I&#39;m also open to any better suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

We kinda bypassed this by counting them and putting them back, and adding everything up in the end.</p> <p>After we finished we had a total of ~2000 coins. I have a feeling that&#39;s not supposed to be. You easily rack up 15+ coins with some moves in later rounds. Does anyone else have this issue or did we do something wrong?

We started with the more casual games, but a few months passed and we decided to play Virtù, despite warnings of its complexity. We got the hang of it but my sister kinda gave up on it along the way, which made me sad. Still, I want to continue playing this game, and introduce it to my friends, who I judge are more experienced players. </p> <p>Also, with my birthday coming up soon, I decided to spoil myself and I buy ROOT. I’m currently waiting for shipment and I’m really looking forward to it, but I’m afraid that people get frustrated with the complexity of the game. </p> <p>So I think that’s the main question of this post. How do I introduce these two particular games, and complex games in general, to other people in a way that nobody gets frustrated and everyone has a great time? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the most common critiques of Euro games is that their themes often feel “pasted on” rather than deeply integrated into the mechanics. Whether you’re farming in Agricola, running a vineyard in Viticulture, or building a network in Brass, the mechanics typically take center stage while the theme serves more as a backdrop.</p> <p>But here’s the thing: does it really matter?</p> <p>Thematic Integration Is in the Eye of the Beholder</p> <p>The truth is, thematic integration is often purely a matter of perception. As players, we subconsciously force connections between the theme and mechanics, even when they aren’t inherently tied.</p> <p>That farmer meeple? Sure, it’s just a token moving across a board, but in your mind, he’s toiling in the fields. That trade route you’re building?
