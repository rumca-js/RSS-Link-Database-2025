This is something I could admittedly do better at. Specifically, there are two monologues in the film that emphasize &quot;you never know this is the last time you&#39;ll do X.&quot; </p> <p>I enjoyed the movie, its themes, and peformances. I was getting ready for bed and thinking about the film in my mind. Maybe 15 minutes after the movie had ended, our baby monitor goes off. I walked into the nursery to replace the pacifier and soothe my kid back to sleep. Then, I connect the dots that this could be the last time I have this kind of moment. I started to weep and really reflect on enjoying these experiences of parenthood. I&#39;m genuinely grateful that the movie made me consider this more closely. </p> <p>Has anyone else watched and not had an outward response to it intially, but late

It could be a brutal murder, a cold and emotionless decision, or an act so heartless it defies what normal people would find acceptable. For example, Amon Goth constructing the concentration camp and mercilessly killing the engineer who tried to explain an issue is a powerful display of such evil.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently watched this movie and enjoyed it quite a bit. No, not the American remake, the original 2014 Austrian horror one. It started slow but built up pretty well. And even though I could see the plot twist from a mile away, the way it unravelled was really good. </p> <p>Have you guys watched this movie? If yes, what do you guys think about it? If not, I would suggest to give it a try.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PreparationOver2099"> /u/PreparationOver2099 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxe42x/goodnight_mommy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxe42x/goodnight_mommy/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This movie is something special. The cast meshes extremely well. Sigourney Weaver was smoking hot in the movie and delivers some phenomenal jokes. Tim Allen is at his peak. Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn’t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he’s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too. </p> <p>What I love about this movie is that it’s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. </p> <p>Some of my favorites lines in this movie:</p> <p><em>lands on ship</em> …….Aaaahhhhhhhhhh</p> <p>Wait! Don’t open that! It’s an alien planet!!! Is there air?! You don’t know!!!….sniff sniff…seems like there is air</p> <p>We have to get out of here before they kill guy!!</p> <p>Guy, you have a last name. Do I?!?! Do I?!?!

## Physiological thrillers like The Machinist, Enemy, Identity or Vivarium

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently watched the movies stated above and absolutely loved them. Especially The Machinist. That was a deep movie with an outcome I have never seen before in a movie... Anyone have any recommendations for some psychological thrillers similar to the ones listed. Movies that keep you guessing the whole way through or that have a really good twist at the end. Many thanks in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/x4FRNT"> /u/x4FRNT </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxc9j5/physiological_thrillers_like_the_machinist_enemy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxc9j5/physiological_thrillers_like_the_machinist_enemy/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking at it, I’m pretty pessimistic about this year when it comes to movies. Going to see Nosferatu tonight, which I guess is technically a 2024 film, and I’m excited for Mickey 17 which comes out in march, I believe. Other than that, not really a single film I look forward to seeing. I hope some of them prove me wrong and turn out to be great. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Okunoki"> /u/Okunoki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxbzw3/2025_movies_what_are_you_most_excited_about/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxbzw3/2025_movies_what_are_you_most_excited_about/">[comments]</a></span>

## Movies based off video games

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The new movie on Hulu “Mr. Crockett” is obviously found it’s source material in the video game “Amanda’s Adventure,” feat a demon possessed children’s show on VHS tape and starring a black lead. I also saw an ad for a new horror movie “Wolfman” which seems like an idea similar to the werewolves in the woods that look human in that game “The Quarry,” but with its own mental illness driven narrative. Are there any other examples of movies borrowing from popular video games like this ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Trainn"> /u/No-Trainn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxaz78/movies_based_off_video_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hxaz78/movies_based_off_video_games/">[comments]</a></span>

So I pressed play.</p> <p>About halfway through, I started gaslighting myself, as the entire time leading up I was just like &quot;what the actual fuck is this shit&quot; it was terrible! I googled it and laughed because the reviews and ratings were terrible. </p> <p>It&#39;s pretty interesting how our perspectives and tastes change over time, and what you remember is not always what is true now. </p> <p>What movies do y&#39;all have similar experiences with?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prestigious_Gear_169"> /u/Prestigious_Gear_169 </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I downloaded 1932 Mummy via torrent back in 2016/2017 and it came with what I recall to be documentary about movie production, possibly DVD extra.</p> <p>While randomly clicking through that documentary, I saw a short scene of mummy walking toward a man, while he fires two shots from shotgun into his stomach from around 2 meters distance, while backing away. Scene had a sound and you could hear dog barking in the background. Effect of shot hiting mummy was very impressive for a time. </p> <p>After seeing the film and not seeing that scene, I figured it mist have been cut for being too intense. But recently I heard that not a single cut scene from this movie survived. Now I&#39;m buffled, what have I seen? Was it from some other movie or something?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BilSajks"> /u/BilSajks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hx75dq/deleted_scene_from_19

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished the movie and have never read the book but I am genuinely confused what motivated him to pursue Lara so deeply and completely forget his wife. The adultery is one thing but later on why were Tonya and Sasha just not mentioned in any capacity. The ending to me is a lot less tragic because I just couldn&#39;t skim or get over the fact he doesn&#39;t seem too bothered about the child and wife he lost. Yuri is painted as moral, thoughtful and poetic so his carelessness in losing his first son slightly confused me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SuitNo1243"> /u/SuitNo1243 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hx66e5/doctor_zhivago/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hx66e5/doctor_zhivago/">[comments]</a></span>
