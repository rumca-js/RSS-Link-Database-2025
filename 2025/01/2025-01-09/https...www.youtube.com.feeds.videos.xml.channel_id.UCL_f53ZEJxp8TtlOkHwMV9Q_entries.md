Jordan Peterson sits down with actor, author, and comedian Rob Schneider. They discuss the unpredictable changes to both major political parties during the last presidential election, the fall of Hollywood and celebrity culture (by their own hand), how new and independent media finally broke the machine, and why Rob began speaking politically in spite of personal cost and sacrifice.

Rob Schneider is an accomplished actor, comedian, screenwriter, and director. A stand-up comic and veteran of the award-winning NBC sketch comedy series “Saturday Night Live,” Schneider has gone on to a successful career in films, television, and continues his worldwide stand-up tour.

This episode was filmed on November 25th, 2024.
