One of the few horror games that I&#39;ve ever played and completed was Signalis, which I still think about often because that experience was quite special to me. That got me thinking though, since Signalis, even though it&#39;s a fantastic game on its own, borrows a lot of concepts from both Resident Evil and Silent Hill. The inventory system, save rooms, cryptic puzzles, limited ammunition, enemies come back unless you permanently kill them with a special item etc. These are all &#39;tropes&#39; that RE and SH started, and it has sort of become a genre of its own. </p> <p>What bothers me is that when you go on steam and try to look for games that are similar to these two franchises, your only bet is to go through the survival horror section. It&#39;s the overhauling genre, sure, but that&#39;s like if you&#39;re trying to find games similar to Dark Souls if the term Souls-",
