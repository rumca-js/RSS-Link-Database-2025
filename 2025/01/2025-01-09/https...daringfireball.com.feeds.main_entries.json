Brilliantly\nsimple, and in a way, fun, with its clever \u201cemoji scale\u201d. I\nstarted using it last week after Murray pinged me about it, but\nonly because I was interested in the idea of a widget-only weather\napp\u2009\u2014\u2009Philadelphia generally doesn\u2019t have air quality issues. I\nshould have known better. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1417614057813725185\">Turns out</a>, the whole world now has air\nquality issues.</p>\n\n<p>Breathable costs just $2, and Murray is donating a portion of the\nproceeds to foundations focused on climate change initiatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Breathable is now up to version 3.0, and is better than ever.
