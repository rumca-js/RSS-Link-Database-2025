Moana was a pretty big hit when it came out in 2016, but it became even more popular when it hit Disney Plus, becoming the most streamed movie on their platform. Naturally Disney wanted more- this time in the form of a streaming series. Wait, no– a movie! Yeah, a movie.

Moana 2 does raise some questions. Like why does this feel like it should have been a TV show? Why are there so many new characters that don’t do anything? What’s up with that bat lady just suddenly not being evil? What are Moana’s powers now?

To answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George’s Pitch Meeting for Moana 2!
