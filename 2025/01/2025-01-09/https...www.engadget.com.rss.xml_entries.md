<p>Grok, the AI assistant that's for some reason baked into X, is now available as <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grok/id6670324846" data-original-link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grok/id6670324846">a standalone app</a>. Like the version that exists as a tab on the social media platform, the Grok app can be used to generate images, summarize text and answer questions, with a conversational tone xAI, the AI assistant's creator, calls "humorous and engaging."</p>
<p>The app was first tested with a limited set of users in December 2024, right around the same time X debuted <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/if-youre-really-bored-xs-grok-ai-chatbot-is-now-free-to-use-194715700.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/if-youre-really-bored-xs-grok-ai-chatbot-is-now-free-

<p>CES 2025 is coming to a close, and team Engadget is ready to leave Las Vegas. Our reporters and editors have scoured endless carpeted convention halls, braved lines of chain smokers and fielded thousands of emails a day to find the best and most credible products at the show.</p>
<p>As expected, the vast majority of things we saw this CES had an AI component, with a noticeable uptick in AR glasses, hearing aid earbuds, solar-powered tech, emotional support robots and robot vacuums. Apparently people really like robovacs that can pick up socks. Our team was encouraged to see more growth in tech built to improve the lives of those with disabilities and mobility issues, too.</p>

<p>The long-awaited <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> has been delayed yet again, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/09/3007241/0/en/Strategic-update.html">according to a press release</a>. It was supposed to come out on February 14 but Ubisoft has moved the release date to March 20. This is actually the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-is-delayed-until-february-14-184514006.html">second time it was delayed</a>. It was originally supposed to come out in time for the 2024 holiday season.</p>
<p>The stated reason is the same as the last delay. The developers say they’re using the extra time to continue polishing the game, which has previously been described as &quot;the biggest entry in the franchise.” Ubisoft says it has been continually checking player feedback from the community and making changes accordingly.</p>

<p>CES is a great place to check out all sorts of upcoming tech for the year, but it’s often the wildest gadgets <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-weirdest-tech-and-gadgets-we-saw-at-ces-2024-233003886.html">that steal the show</a>. The conference hosts thousands of exhibitors, all vying for attention, and you really never know what they’re gonna come up with. And this year's show did not let us down. So without further ado, here's the weirdest tech at CES 2025 that we encountered — all of the crazy (and crazy useful) devices we spotted out in the wild of the show floor. Just keep in mind, weird doesn't necessarily mean bad — we actually want to buy some of these! They're just not quite the run-of-the-mill laptop or TV from the big vendors that dominated the show floor.</p>

<p>If you know anything about coffee, and <em>coffee snobs</em>, you’ll know they’re always going on about where their beans are sourced from. The preference for single origin beans is better for traceability, transparency, and when you discover a variety you adore, you can keep going back.

It’s essentially the electronic equivalent to a guide dog, helping users avoid obstacles when walking around. The Romanian company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2025-live-updates-the-best-tech-announcements-and-gadget-news-from-las-vegas-100003597.html">turned up to CES 2025 in Las Vegas</a> armed with prototypes of its headset that it hopes will make blind people’s lives a lot easier.</p>
<p>The headset looks like a chunky piece of VR gear, with a front unit sitting on your forehead just above your eyes. There’s a chunky power and processing pack on the rear that keeps the bulky device&#39;s weight balanced while walking around. In the front, there are six computer vision cameras — three near field and three pointed further away — which Amariei says was inspired by Tesla’s setup.</p>

CES is known for setting the stage for the forthcoming year in tech, with lots of prototypes on display and always a few pieces of vaporware that never materialize. The gear you can actually buy immediately is typically few and far between, but this year there are a number of gadgets on sale (or available for pre-order) right now. Those range from a “smart” baby bouncer and bassinet to smart glasses and Wi-Fi 7 routers. If you’re keen on becoming an early adopter, these are the CES gadgets you can buy right now.</p>

<p>There's more nuance to Doomguy than him just being a fella who eradicates hellspawn with the BFG. He's quite the art connoisseur as well — or at least that's what <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/doom-marine-crashes-art-gallery-politely-sips-wine/">a new <em>Doom</em> mod</a> might have you believe.</p>
<p>Modders Filippo Meozzi and Liam Stone turned E1M1, the first map in the original game, into an interactive art gallery. <em>Doom: The Gallery Experience</em>, which is a free browser game on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://bobatealee.itch.io/doom-the-gallery-experience">Itch.io</a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/960452">Newgrounds</a>, sees Doomguy wielding a glass of wine or can of beer as he peruses classic works of art, collects cash and listens to Johann Sebastian Bach's "Suite No. 1 in G major."</p>

<p>Google knows a lot about you and your interests, and it uses that information to try and get more of your time and attention. A new Search Labs experiment called &quot;Daily Listen,&quot; for instance, can turn your Discover feed into a professional podcast. Google&#39;s Discover is a curated feed on mobile devices filled with articles and videos that the company&#39;s algorithms believe are aligned with your interests based on your search queries and other activities. As <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/08/google-discover-daily-listen/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> notes, this feature is similar to the one Google <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-ai-notebook-can-generate-a-podcast-about-your-notes-140004869.html">released for NotebookLM</a> last year.

<p>When it comes to gaming, laptops have come a long way. Once seen as the lesser cousin to gaming PCs, today’s gaming laptops pack a serious punch, offering remarkable power and portability in sleek packages. Whether you’re exploring open-world RPGs, dominating multiplayer arenas or creating content on the side, modern gaming laptops deliver performance that can rival many desktop rigs, with the added bonus of being able to game wherever you want.<br><br>One of the biggest advantages of a laptop is its flexibility. You don’t need to worry about bulky setups or being tethered to one spot. Plus, with features like displays with high refresh rates, powerful GPUs and cutting-edge processors, these machines are more than capable of handling AAA titles, eSports and even VR gaming. Many laptops now come equipped with RGB-lit keyboards, advanced cooling systems and next-gen SSD storage to keep up with your gaming needs, too. We’ve tested a number of the latest gaming laptops to see which ar

<p>Laptops have long rivaled desktops in terms of power. But those slim and portable machines lack something their tower-shaped cousins tend to have in abundance: ports. Docking stations let you plug in monitors, mice, keyboards, storage devices and more using just a single port on your laptop. And if you're someone who relocates with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html">your laptop</a> often, a docking station makes it easier to get all your accessories connected again when you’re back at your desk. We tested out more than 15 highly rated docking stations and considered monitor support, number and type of ports, design and price to help you determine which one is the best docking station for your home or office setup.</p>
