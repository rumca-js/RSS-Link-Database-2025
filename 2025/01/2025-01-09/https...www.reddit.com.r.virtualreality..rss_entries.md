Basically just took it out of the box, plugged it in, set it up and made sure it was working.</p> <p>Now, about a month later, I&#39;m trying to actually play with it but the damn thing will just not work. When I open a game, I get a huge window blocking the game telling me that it can&#39;t track my headset.</p> <p>I cleared the play area data and tried to set it up again, but it no longer works. I open the app, connect the headset and both controllers, and it detects them just fine. Click the &quot;...&quot; and on Play Area Settings. It opens up a secondary window where it tells me to put on my PSVR 2. On the headset, however, it shows me an icon telling me to remove my headset and look at the screen.</p> <p>I tried restarting Steam VR and Steam, as well as replugging the adapter and the headset.
