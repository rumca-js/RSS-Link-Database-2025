There's a bunch of stuff going on this week, with the latest teaser for Last of Us season 2, the news that Skeleton Crew got even lower viewership than The Acolyte, Sony executives blaming YouTube critics for their failed superhero movies, and that producers for James Bond are currently at war with Amazon over the future of the character. So join me Disparu, Reaper, Metal and MauLer as we get into it.
