<p>He was the brilliant yet alarming writer of the Futurist Manifesto, a bohemian poet jailed with Mussolini who helped forge the modern world. As a new show re-examines his troubling legacy, we explore the Italian troublemaker’s extraordinary life</p><p>Filippo Tommaso Marinetti was the Elon Musk of the early 20th century, combining a joy in technological innovation with an appetite for illiberal politics. Where Musk builds rockets, Marinetti celebrated those shiny new inventions, the aeroplane and the motor car. The Futurist Manifesto, which he wrote when the movement existed only in his head, begins with a rhapsodic account of a fast drive that ends in a crash, which delights him more than the Winged Victory of Samothrace, the famous Greek sculpture in the Louvre. Machines, he believes, make all previous art irrelevant.

<p>A​ Glastonbury duet with Chris Martin shot her skyward​. Now, the self-reflective singer’s debut album is a marvel of candid songwriting​ – too candid for some, she says</p><p>Like many people, Victoria Canal failed to score tickets to last year’s Glastonbury festival. But the singer-songwriter’s solution wasn’t quite so relatable: Coldplay were headlining, so she messaged Chris Martin to ask if he could get her in. It was 1am in London, and Canal was drinking with friends when Martin called to make a better offer: how about she join him on stage?</p><p>The next day, Canal thought she had “hallucinated” the entire conversation. “I have had many dreams like that before,” she says. But no. Come June, there she was: providing vocal and piano accompaniment to Paradise in front of an enraptured 100,000-strong crowd. In the footage, she seems to be in her element, completely unfazed by such a gargantuan gig. In reality, was she nervous? She pauses and gives me a strange look. “Of <em>co

## Rowan Atkinson at 70: his best films – ranked!

<p>To mark his birthday this week, we celebrate his versatility from bumbling Mr Bean to his punctilious headteacher in The Secret Policeman’s Ball</p><p>Atkinson is the bumbling Father Gerald, who praises “the Holy Goat”, invites the happy couple to be “Johned in matrimony” and asks the groom to take his bride to be his “awful wedded wife”. Cutaways to the congregation’s reactions – Hugh Grant snickering, Simon Callow stifling a guffaw – do little to convince us that Richard Curtis’s script is top-tier stuff. At least Atkinson brings some typically subtle modulations, such as the vicar’s premature flickers of smugness when he wrongly believes his worst malapropisms to be behind him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/09/rowan-atkinson-at-70-his-best-films-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>(City Slang)<br></strong>Championed by Iggy Pop and riot grrrl royalty, the Brighton duo pile on the jagged riffs, scabrous humour and swearing for their politically charged debut</p><p>For the most part, Lambrini Girls’ debut album barrels along in roughly the style that’s hoisted the Brighton duo to cult success over the last few years. There are huge, distorted basslines courtesy of Lily Macieira and equally distorted guitar playing from Phoebe Lunny that flits between post-punk angularity and occasional bursts of poppier, Ramones-y chords. The rhythms are frantically paced, and there are lyrics that focus on societal ills, delivered in Lunny’s distinctive vocal style: she sings like someone angrily trying to make their point in a particularly noisy bar, as a bouncer struggles to usher them out of the door.</p><p>Combined, this music has drawn appreciative nods from a range of forebears including Iggy Pop, Kathleen Hanna and Sleater Kinney’s Corin Tucker and Carrie Brow

<p> A powerfully inspiring study of optimism that avoids farcical good cheer</p><p>Humans are unrealistically optimistic about the world and the future; we systematically under­estimate our chances of experiencing unpleasant diseases, going through a divorce, or losing a loved one. About the only people who don’t see the world through the lens of this “optimism bias” are the clinically depressed. Depressive realism – the name given to the relative immunity of the melancholic to this illusion – suggests that we see reality clearly only at the cost of our mental health. This presents psychologists with an interesting dilemma. We are always caught between the delusion of wearing rose-tinted spectacles, and the debilitating affect of taking them off. Should we prioritise accuracy or happiness?</p><p>Sumit Paul-Choudhury comes down firmly on the side of optimism in this lively exploration of glass-half-full thinking and its relationship with social progress.

<p>Like all modern takes on frontier life, this drama focuses on its brutish nature. We’ve seen it all before – even if it is a gripping yarn</p><p>American Primeval opens in Utah Territory, 1857. “Wild and untamed,” says the caption, which is good to know. Furthermore, “the United States army, Mormon militia, Native Americans and pioneers are all locked in a brutal war for survival. Caught in the bloody crossfire are every man, woman and child who dare to enter this American primeval.”</p><p>And there, pretty much, you have it. The six-part series is clearly a prestige project – gorgeously photographed, ably directed (by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/aug/10/painkiller-review-matthew-brodericks-character-is-just-evil">Painkiller</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/06/best-sports-shows-watch-to-watch-friday-night-lights-streaming">Friday Night Lights</a>’ Peter Berg), priding itself on the authenticity of the physical realities o

<p>Victor Pelevin made his name in 90s Russia with scathing satires of authoritarianism. But while his literary peers have faced censorship and fled the country, he still sells millions. Has he become a Kremlin apologist?</p><p>Fiction has a habit of coming to life in Russia. On the evening of 2 April 2023, the military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky appeared at an event in St Petersburg organised by Cyber Front Z, a group of semi-professional keyboard warriors who boost Kremlin war propaganda online. With more than half a million followers, Tatarsky was a mid-tier celebrity on Telegram, the social media app that has become a hub of Russian news and political debate.</p><p>As guests mingled, a young woman with long, salon-waved blond hair approached Tatarsky. She presented him with an unusual gift: a gold-painted statue of himself. About two minutes later, the statue exploded, killing Tatarsky and injuring 42 people. The blond woman – 26-year-old St Petersburg native Darya Trepova – was ar

<p>Whether it’s oat, bone, sand or fawn, this colour palette has a strong anaesthetising effect – and it has become the leading fashion and interiors style of our era</p><p>It’s not that 39-year-old Mina Tran wants a life completely devoid of bright colours. She just doesn’t want them anywhere near her home or her children’s wardrobes. “You can’t avoid them,” says the doctor and mother of three from Texas. “They creep into areas of my life that I can’t control. You go outside and the grass is green.”</p><p>Nor can she prevent her children from growing up and developing their own taste, or family members buying things for them in brash reds and blues, or her husband dressing them – and it gives her no pleasure to recount this – “in colourful stuff from Amazon without me knowing”. But for now, in the small areas of her life that she has sway over, Tran dreams in taupe and fawn, parchment and bisque.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/09/the-sad-beige-aesthet

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary announced its word of the year at the end of 2024: brain rot. The term relates to the supposedly negative effects of consuming social media content, but it struck a chord more widely with many of us who feel we just don’t have the mental capacity we once did. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, has been studying our waning attention spans for 20 years.
