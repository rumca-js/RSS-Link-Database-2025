Of course, we knew we\u2019d hear a lot about AI \u2014 <em>check</em> \u2014 and that there\u2019d be announcements of new CPUs and GPUs \u2014<em> also check</em>. But you just never know how the all the pomp and hoo-ha of this annual mega tech event is going to pay off in the real-world, for regular consumers. Does the average PC user have something to be excited about now that the veil has come off of this year\u2019s product launches? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the PCWorld staff is any indication, the answer is <em>yes</em>! We found plenty of cool products, innovations, and advances at this year\u2019s show that are currently available or promise exciting things ahead. Our picks don\u2019t stop at PC hardware, either. What\u2019s CES without an array of goods for the tech-loving lifestyle? We note a few of our favorite home-tech products, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 cl",
