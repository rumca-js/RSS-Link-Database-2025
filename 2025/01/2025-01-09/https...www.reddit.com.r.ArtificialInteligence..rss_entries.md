And it’s beginning to happen. Scientists are now designing computer programs that may unlock the ability to simulate human cells, giving researchers the ability to predict the effect of a drug, mutation, virus, or any other change in the body, and in turn making physical experiments more targeted and likelier to succeed. Inspired by large language models such as ChatGPT, the hope is that generative AI can ‘decode the language of biology and then speak the language of biology,’ Eric Xing, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and the president of Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, in the United Arab Emirates, told me. <a href="https://theatln.tc/NUbo5zTi">https://theatln.tc/NUbo5zTi</a></p> <p>“Much as a

Ashqar, Omar Darwish, and Eman Hammad.</p> <p>The paper addresses a significant challenge in the identification of text origins, distinguishing between human-authored pieces and those generated by various Large Language Models (LLMs). It illuminates the pressing need to discern and attribute content with the rise of AI-generated texts, which have implications for academic integrity and content originality.</p> <p>Key highlights include:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Dual-Phase Classification</strong>: The methodology involves a binary classification to differentiate human-written from AI-generated text, followed by a multi-class classification to distinguish

But is this truly intelligence?</p> <p>These models don’t inherently understand anything. They take inputs, identify patterns, and produce outputs that most closely resemble scenarios they’ve seen during training. This doesn’t align with my understanding of intelligence—it feels more like sophisticated pattern matching.</p> <p>I’ve explored many rabbit holes, from building trading bots using traditional AI to mapping predefined relational schemas in datasets to derive true Business Intelligence (BI for those in the industry).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Unfortunately I am rather new to learning about how machine learning works in the back-end. I am looking to learn about LLMs as quickly and efficiently as possible. My plan was to go through these few courses/books: </p> <p>Coursera - AI For Everyone<br/> Coursera - Machine Learning<br/> The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book (Burkov)<br/> Andrew Ng - Machine Learning Yearning<br/> Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop)<br/> Coursera - Deep Learning<br/> Stanford – Natural language processing with deep learning</p> <p>Is there anything I should change? Anything I&#39;m missing? Order in reading/watching is from top down.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>P.S., I have taken engineering math courses (calc 1-3, discrete math, linear alg, diff eq, etc) so I am fine with those pre-requisites.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Life-Cockroach-8156"> /u/Life-Cockroach-8156 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://
