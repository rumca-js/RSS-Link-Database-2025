While doing this course I have found out that it’s not really for me and i’d like to change the direction of my future career. My question to you guys is what would be the best first step to get into programming/cybersecurity? It might be impossible to get into masters without prior experience or any knowledge so that I was debating Coursera courses in programming languages, cybersecurity etc but I genuinely don’t know if that’s the correct route. As you’re already experienced what would you do to get a good start in that field? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Willymonk"> /u/Willymonk </a> <br/> <span><a href="http://coursera.org">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hxd1m0/how_to_start_that_is_the_question
