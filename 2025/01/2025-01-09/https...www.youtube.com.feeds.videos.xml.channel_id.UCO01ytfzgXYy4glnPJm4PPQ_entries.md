Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the city of Los Angeles is going up in flames. The Left claims it’s a product of “climate change,” but that’s because they don’t want to talk about the real cause, which is incompetence—if not outright sabotage—by the Democratic leaders of LA and California. Also, Joe Biden finally admits that he actually may not have been capable of serving a second term. A new study finds that vegans are often depressed and miserable—I didn’t need a study to tell me that. And, a Hollywood actor goes on Bill Maher’s podcast and tries to defend sex changes for kids. It doesn’t go well.

Trump appears to be taking the idea of purchasing Greenland and taking control of the Panama Canal very seriously. Is that a good idea? And should we just conquer Canada while we’re at it?
