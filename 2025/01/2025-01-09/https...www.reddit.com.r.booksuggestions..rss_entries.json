I would like for it to be mainly adventure but I don\u2019t mind romance or spice. I love a strong lead that\u2019s sarcastic w attitude and has a humorous inner dialogue. All of these are pretty loose parameters I mainly want an alternative/emo/goth mc! Bonus points if it\u2019s not abt vampires!! Don\u2019t get me wrong I love a good vampire storyline but it\u2019s a bit cliche especially for non-traditional mcs. </p> <p>Some of my fav books for context: -Throne of glass (ALL TIME FAV SO GOOD)</p> <p>-Dealing with Dragons (v young, but nostalgic I love Cimorene it\u2019s my comfort book)</p> <p>-The Alchemist: The Secrets of Immortality by Nicholas Flamel (a bit ya but I love love love the whole series) </p> <p>-The Night Huntress Series (Cat and Bones relationship&gt;&gt;.

I want something with action, a super good story, and a likable main character. If physical copies are available, that&#39;s a bonus, but it&#39;s not a dealbreaker. I&#39;ve heard Lord of the Mysteries is one of the best, so l&#39;m guessing that&#39;s on the list. I don&#39;t care if it starts slow, as long as the story is amazing. If there&#39;s a manhwa version of the web novel, that would be even better, but it&#39;s not a must. Also, I&#39;m willing to try light novels, but is it really worth it? I don&#39;t like having to read so much without pictures. I do like some illustrations, though. I haven&#39;t tried light novels yet, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t judge too quickly. This keeps everything clear and organized.

Ive been super interested in the &quot;incomprehensible&quot; for awhile now and would love more similar books. Havnt finished the series yet, but i plan to. Book one, despite its flaws, was very fulfilling to me and i really enjoyed it. A lot of the issues other people had with it werent an issue with me, and in fact were what i was looking for.

Here\u2019s a bit of context to help you get a sense of her preferences:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Background:</strong> She speaks multiple languages but always reads in English. Her studies and work are related to business, accounting, and finance. We\u2019re based in Singapore and have a Southeast Asian background.</li> <li><strong>Reading Habits:</strong> She mostly reads on her Kindle during commutes or free time. She doesn\u2019t have a strong preference for a specific genre and enjoys exploring a wide range of books. Her reading journey began with fantasy classics like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>Harry Potter</em>. Over time, ",

My girlfriend loves fantasy as well, but a lot of what she reads has female MCs and has romance/smut which I really dislike. She recommended A Court of Thorns and Roses, which I read, but the fact that half of the plot is a female lead in a love triangle with two men turned me off. I normally read manga but there&#39;s really only a few I can get truly invested in at any given moment and the slow dripfeed of chapters drives me crazy. </p> <p>So really, either a non-female MC or an omniscient third person narrator (or several narrators), no smut (but I like romance), and fantasy settings.
