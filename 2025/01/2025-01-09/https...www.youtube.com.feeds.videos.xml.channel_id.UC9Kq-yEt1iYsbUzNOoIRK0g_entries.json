Naturally Disney wanted more- this time in the form of a streaming series. Wait, no\u2013 a movie! Yeah, a movie.\n\nMoana 2 does raise some questions. Like why does this feel like it should have been a TV show? Why are there so many new characters that don\u2019t do anything? What\u2019s up with that bat lady just suddenly not being evil? What are Moana\u2019s powers now?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George\u2019s Pitch Meeting for Moana 2!\n\n\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThe Acolyte Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqwEE6G6zaU\n\nElf Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g79QPlipXzs",
