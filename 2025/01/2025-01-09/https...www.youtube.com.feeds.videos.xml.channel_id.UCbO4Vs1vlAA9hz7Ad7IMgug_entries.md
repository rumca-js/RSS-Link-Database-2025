The Grand Narrative for Warhammer 40,000 was a seven game LARP using the results of games of 40k an Kill Team to tell a larger story amongst three major facts! The Imperials, Orks and Chaos all vied for a series of ancient relics. In this first Mission, teams are sent as pathfinders to guide in the mass assault of troops in Pathfinders!

Jay and I are both using custom forces as a fun excuse to build an emerging narrative, with the Scouts of the Dark Angels taking on my Rogue Trader Inquisitorial Agents!
