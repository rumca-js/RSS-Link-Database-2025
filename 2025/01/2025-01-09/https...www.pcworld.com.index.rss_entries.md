<p>CES 2025 was a good one for gamers, who were treated to <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2569484/surprise-nvidias-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-cost-less-than-you-thought.html">Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs</a> and hints of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568373/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-rdna-4-embrace-the-ai-revolution.html">AMD’s next-gen Radeon RX 9070 GPUs</a>.</p>



<p>We also saw the unveiling of the laptop variants of the GeForce RTX 50 Series, with a range of products starting with the RTX 5070. Next in the series would be the RTX 5070 Ti, then RTX 5080, then RTX 5090 variants, with escalating price points for each.</p>

<p>When gaming mice don’t fit your hand or fail to perform as well as you hope, there’s one possible solution to try: personalization!</p>



<p>Of course, different gaming mice support different levels of personalization. There’s the crazy kind we saw in the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2308835/swiftpoint-z2-review.html">Swiftpoint Z2</a>, which goes as far as having buttons with multiple levels of actuation and haptic feedback, not to mention a chassis that converts into a joystick. Most mice, however, just let you do things like set DPI stages and assign commands. None of these are quite as good as a mouse that lets you 3D print and install your own parts, though.</p>



<p>HP has heard this call to the right kind of customization this year with its HyperX Pulsefire Saga branded gaming mice that, yes, let you download and print your own 3D part

<p>A top-notch streaming box with over-the-air antenna integration has always seemed like a slam-dunk idea to me. Now, an upstart device brand called <a href="https://myvelotv.com">MyVelo TV</a> is actually making it happen.</p>



<p>For $100, the MyVelo TV Premiere box runs Android TV and includes a USB dongle with a single ATSC 3.0 tuner. A built-in MyVelo TV app will let users watch free local channels from the antenna without having to switch inputs or remotes. The device should be available on Amazon in the spring.</p>



<p>Mark Jensen, CEO and co-founder of Shift2Stream, which owns the MyVelo brand, said the streaming box will support 4K video, Dolby Vision HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio, both for streaming content and ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. Support for encrypted ATSC 3.0 channels should also be available at launch, though it wasn’t yet working during a dem
