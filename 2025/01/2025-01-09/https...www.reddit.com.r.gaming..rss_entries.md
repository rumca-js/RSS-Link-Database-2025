<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not into online shooters. But I like a good single player shooter on occasion. Loved control as well. But I’m enjoying this game because 1) fun exploration and traversal mechanics. 2) doesn’t take itself too seriously. 3) de-emphasizes ammo scarcity. 4) Not too difficult. Any recommendations y’all can make to help with next game choices? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hyrulianpokemaster"> /u/hyrulianpokemaster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hx3eeg/other_games_like_high_on_life/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hx3eeg/other_games_like_high_on_life/">[comments]</a></span>
