Good Ranchers - Exclusive offer for my listeners with promo code BEN: https://www.goodranchers.com

The left is FRUSTRATED with Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg and Facebook have completely rewritten the censorship rules and are restoring free expression on their platforms. Ben discusses the media‚Äôs frustration with Meta for claiming fact-checkers were the problem. These ‚Äúfact-checkers‚Äù are mad because Zuckerberg said he would no longer be using their fact-checking resources because they‚Äôre too politicized. Because of this, Meta‚Äôs fact-checkers are being replaced with a form of community notes.
