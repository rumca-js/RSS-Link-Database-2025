        "description": "Based on everything that the developer has said of Avowed so far, it looks like the upcoming fantasy action RPG is going to feature one unique mechanic. \n\nFrom large-scale decisions that will impact the larger world to more intimate choices that will allow for deeper role playing, the developer says Avowed will allow players to tailor the experience to themselves in many different ways. There\u2019s every reason to be optimistic that the developer will make good on those promises. Or so we hope, at least.",

        "description": "Measuring a game's graphical prowess can be tricky. Is it the best execution of the developer's aesthetic vision with the highest fidelity? The most photorealistic visuals truest to real life? Or some combination of the two?\n\nBeauty is often skin deep, but there's no denying that some of the best-looking games of 2025 also potentially classify as must-play titles. We're talking about the likes of Grand Theft Auto 6, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Fable, and much more. The Alters, The Sinking City 2, and Where Winds Meet have also garnered their fair share of interest.\n\nHowever, that's only the tip of the iceberg for games whose graphical fidelity has wowed us before launch. Check out 30 of the most graphically intense titles of 2025 and what makes them worth looking forward to.",
