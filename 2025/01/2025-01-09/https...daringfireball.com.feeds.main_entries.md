<p>I first linked to Breathable back in 2021 when Murray released the first version, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/21/breathable">writing then</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The entire point of Breathable is to offer widgets — the app
itself just lets you configure how the widgets look. Brilliantly
simple, and in a way, fun, with its clever “emoji scale”. I
started using it last week after Murray pinged me about it, but
only because I was interested in the idea of a widget-only weather
app — Philadelphia generally doesn’t have air quality issues. I
should have known better. <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1417614057813725185">Turns out</a>, the whole world now has air
quality issues.</p>

<p>Breathable costs just $2, and Murray is donating a portion of the
proceeds to foundations focused on climate change initiatives.</p>

<p>Breathable is now up to version 3.0, and is better than ever. Today, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@garrettmurray

<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/08/bing-google-masquerade">yesterday’s item regarding Bing masquerading as Google</a> to trick Edge users into searching with it, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@krinkle/113795844747185778">this Mastodon post from Timo Tijhof</a> lists a few other such subterfuge tactics they’ve pulled recently. My favorite was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/28/23702274/microsoft-edge-developer-bing-ai-chatbot-advertisement-google-bard">this one</a> from last year: when users opened a tab for “bard.google.com”, Edge inserted an ad <em>in the tab bar</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/28/23702274/microsoft-edge-developer-bing-ai-chatbot-advertisement-google-bard">encouraging the user to “Compare answers with the AI-powered new Bing”</a>. Ads in the tab bar, jeebus.</p>

<p>There’s also a longstanding practice where if you search for “Chrome” or “Chrome download”, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813
