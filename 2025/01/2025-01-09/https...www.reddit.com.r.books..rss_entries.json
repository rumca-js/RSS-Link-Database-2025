I just finished a book where I was constantly struggling to imagine anything in the room with the characters, what the characters were wearing, and even what time of day it was. And while it seems like this was meant to make it easier to get to the meat of the story/action, in reality, it made it <em>much</em> harder to focus on the story because I couldn&#39;t see anything at all with my mind&#39;s eye. I had to keep making up the setting myself if I wanted to &quot;see&quot; the story like a movie, which actually took way more work than if the author had described it in expanded detail.</p> <p>After finally finishing that book, I switched to an older novel that was extremely descriptive, which made it longer than it would have been without those deta",

It is the closest representation of how I think an apocalyptic scenario would unfold in the US and that&#39;s an opinion which has only been strengthened by the wildfire situation currently unfolding.

A diary-style novel, it is so prescient I couldn&#39;t believe it.

I read a few posts analyzing the obvious shot at the beauty industry, connections between the book-world and real-world cults (specifically Tom Cruise and Scientology), and about various symbols Awad employs. I also read <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1cl8h7m/unsolicited_analysis_of_mona_awads_rouge/\">this excellent post</a> from u/<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/New-Falcon-9850/\">New-Falcon-9850</a> which I thought was exactly right and really well written. </span></p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">What I want to dig in to is the messaging that Belle&#39;s mother passes on to her about relationships, sex, and trusting your own judgement. Belle&#39;s mother repeatedly chooses men over her daughter or listens to men over her daughter. There are many examples, but I&#39;m thinking of the scene where young Belle wants to watch Tom Cruise movies",

If nothing else, Heart of Darkness is incredibly honest and paints an authentic picture of how some white people critical of colonialism felt about the practice. I particularly love how otherworldly the horror Marlowe felt was at his own doubts and the &quot;new world&#39; h",

Many people didn&#39;t like that I had expectations for this book, and I can appreciate how that may seem unfair. I still stand that this book was a huge disappointment. However, I took what I loved most: the Pioneers chapter. I loved the actual game roleplay and realized this is what I was truly looking for in the book in regards to a kind of expectation. So from here, I found a category of books that I had no clue existed: litRPG.</p> <p>There, I discovered Dungeon Crawler Carl and it&#39;s everything I ever wanted in a cheesy game book. I understand it&#39;s not a Pulitzer Prize caliber book, but it just absolutely scratches that itch I couldn&#39;t reach.</p> <p>So I make this post for anyone who commented or may have agreed that they felt lost in this book. As an 18 year WoW player and dungeon crawler myself, I definitely found joy in this series.</p> </div><!-- S",
