I bought my rig in 2020 and it&#39;s served me well, but since I&#39;ve been getting back into gaming recently I&#39;m getting an itch to upgrade</p> <p>I always thought my setup should be fine, but even things like watching youtube videos and noticing weird frame drops/slight stuttering, or generally dragging / resizing windows around. I crave smoothness. I upgraded what I thought was my weak point and got an AMD 7 5800x3d, but games like Kingdom Come: Deliverance felt a little sluggish, and it seems to run super hot - my fans getting loud stresses me out.

Additionally, if the same person is found to have created a new account to get past the ban, on their new account, $1000 will be taken from their chosen payment method when it is cancelled.</p> <p>And for games without paid subscriptions, simply require a card to be on file for identity and micro-transaction payments, plus to be used to fine them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GhostInThePudding"> /u/GhostInThePudding </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.red

Following the configuration guides on the Arch wiki and the Hyprland wiki xcom 2 and a couple of other games worked perfectly by just forcing Proton 9 in the game preferences, no additional configuration needed. </p> <p>Then I remembered that I had The Witcher 3 Complete Edition on GoG, googled a bit and figured Lutris might be a good thing to try. I had to google a lot and install wine and a whole swarm of lib32 and vulkan packages, but with more luck than actual comprehension I managed to get The Witcher running perfectly and Starsector runs well through Lutris, too.</p> <p>Problem is, once I returned to Steam after a bit to continue my xcom campaign for a bit of variety, the resolution was off and the menu screen as well as the splash screens preceding it were running at &lt;1FPS. Problem is that I didn&#39;t need to configure Proton at all in the first place to get it to work so I don&#39;t know

You can click the add button and search for &quot;EA app&quot;, then click &quot;EA App&quot; with the subtitle &quot;2022, Windows&quot;. Alternatively if you have a Lutris account you can add it to your library <a href="https://lutris.net/games/ea-app/">here</a>. The default options during install should be fine. Installation may take a while. Once EA is successfully installed and launched, you can safely close both EA and Lutris.</p> <p>For the next step, open Heroic and click on the EA game you want to play. Click install, and then use the default options here. Since it&#39;s from EA, it won&#39;t actually install the game, nor will i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone.</p> <p>I decided to give Linux gaming another go as SteamOS has made me quite excited. Before this, I&#39;ve only used ZorinOS (For about 2 weeks in 2022) and more recently Bazzite (For a few days at around May 2024). I decided to go back to Windows after playing around with them because the FPS penalty I was getting in games compared to Windows was far too great. Around 30% for Zorin and 15-25% for Bazzite. Not to mention the crazy amount of stuttering (Happens way more on Bazzite than Zorin) when I&#39;m just navigating around and using my browser.</p> <p>Anyway, 3rd time&#39;s the charm I guess as I&#39;m currently on CachyOS and not only has the entire experience been completely smooth, but I actually do not suffer the performance penalty while gaming any more. In fact, I&#39;m actually gaining average and 1% low fps in Helldivers 2 and Zenless Zone Zero in CachyOS when compared to my very debloated Win 11 install. I would have been
