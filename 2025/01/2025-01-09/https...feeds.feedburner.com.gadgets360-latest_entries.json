As North America drifted over this hotspot, the lithosphere weakened, enabling glacial forces during the Ice Age to carve the deep depressions of these massive lakes. Seismic data supports this theory, showing unusual wave movements beneath the region. This discovery highlights the combined impact of Earth's deep processes and surface phenomena in shaping one of North America's most iconic landscapes",

        "description": "In the Caucasus Mountains, drone mapping has uncovered Dmanisis Gora, an ancient settlement dating back over 3,000 years. The project, led by Dr. Nathaniel Erb-Satullo and Dimitri Jachvliani, employed drones to capture high-resolution images of the site, revealing a vast defensive wall, graves, and other structural remains. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about the size and complexity of the settlement, offering new insights into ancient urbanism. By comparing drone-generated data with Cold War-era satellite images, researchers have gained valuable information on population dynamics, agricultural practices and socio-economic structures of the time",
