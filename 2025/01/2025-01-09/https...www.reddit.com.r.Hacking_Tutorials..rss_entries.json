I was just wondering on how they access the files and navigate the scammers\u2019 computers without them being aware of what is currently happening. I know that the hackers can monitor the physical presence through the scammers\u2019 webcams. Some of the scammers are already putting tape on their webcams to avoid being monitored physically.</p> <p>Does a RAT allow the hacker to navigate the scammers\u2019 computers through accessing files, downloading data, opening applications, and logging-in on software platforms even if the scammers is using the computer at the same time. Does the hacker do all of these with the scammers using their computers at the same time?</p> <p>Or does the hacker wait for the victims to lock their computer and get away from their chair before the hacker makes a move? It just puzzles me because how did these youtube hackers do all the navigation and informatio",
