In today's Daily Fix:
Assassin's Creed Shadows has been hit with another setback. Ubisoft has announced a new release date of March 20, 2025, roughly a month later than the previous release date of February 14, which itself was delayed from the original release date of November 12, 2024. Ubisoft explained that this was to give the game more time for polish and to implement feedback from the past three months. In other news, Nintendo has announced a new handheld: a LEGO Gameboy. Sorry, it's not the Switch 2 announcement you were looking for, but could be a cool item for collectors.
