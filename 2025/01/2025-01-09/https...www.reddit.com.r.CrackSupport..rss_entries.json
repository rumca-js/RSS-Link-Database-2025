My friend tried to download Remnant 2 from fitgirl. He has windows 11 and I was helping him through the download. I am sure I followed all the instructions listed on the site and I get some EOS AUTH error or something like EOS UNEXPECTED ERROR. I deleted antivirus. Checked if it ate files (it didn&#39;t), I disabled Windows defender fully, still nothing. I should note that I disabled antiviruses AFTER the download, but QuickSFW said all fiels are there and OK. I don&#39;t know what to do, please help.

I recently downloaded the cracked version of solidworks on my work laptop which is more powerful than my personal one. I was using it for a 30 days personal challenge in order to master the software and get myself a more technical job. I was sharing the projects on LinkedIn and my company superiors noticed it and they told me they don&#39;t want to take the risk of getting fined by the OEM. I dug a bit into the crack and it uses lmtools from flexera (flexnet) and my current understanding of the way it works is that there is a local server which is acting as the OEM&#39;s and that&#39;s how it works. I just want to be sure I&#39;m safe and not putting the company in danger. I can always use my personal laptop but it&#39;s a pain in the ass and I currently can&#39;t afford a good one.
