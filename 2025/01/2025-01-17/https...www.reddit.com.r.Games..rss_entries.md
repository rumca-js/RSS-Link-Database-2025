<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is inspired by me downloading Forspoken for free on PS Premium. I know the game had horrific reviews, but I thought some of the combat/parkour looked fun, so for free, what the heck let&#39;s give it a 5-10 hour shot.</p> <p>I have never been so bored by an opening sequence in a game ever. And that was with me skipping as much of every cutscene I could. Most good openings are there to set a narrative in place while also giving you a mini-tutorial of some of the basic elements of the game. Forspoken had you doing pointless things like holding square to feed your cat, and climbing repeated ladders. </p> <p>Eventually you finally get the cuff on your hand but by then, I was numbed to the core and didn&#39;t care to even get to the combat and stuff. Uninstalled after 45 minutes. </p> <p>What other games are like this? Any of them out there redeem themselves after a horrific opening sequence?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=
