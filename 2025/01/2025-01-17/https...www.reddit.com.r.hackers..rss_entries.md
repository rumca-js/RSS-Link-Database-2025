<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had a student who had to take a test on a laptop that belonged to the school. However, the admin forgot the firmware password, now the laptop either has to be sent to the shop or the chip has to be replaced is there any way that we can get around it just through the laptop, or codes. I don&#39;t know much about coding, please help me out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SignalRefrigerator39"> /u/SignalRefrigerator39 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i3g7bp/firmware_passcode/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i3g7bp/firmware_passcode/">[comments]</a></span>
