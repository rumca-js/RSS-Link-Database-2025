Tried disabling windows defender but that also didn\u2019t work. Then I opened my task manager to see that when I double clicked the launch button, it the application appeared on task manager, for a few seconds, it stayed as the app with the most cpu and ram usage but then it the usage would lowe and lower until the the app would disappear from the task manager list. The same thing happened after I installed the game from DODI repacks website. </p> <p>This has happened with some other games like forza horizon 5 from DODI but the game worked after I downloaded it from el amigos. It&#39;s not a DODI-only issue because spiderman remastered and spidereman miles morales, both from DODI worked. How ",
