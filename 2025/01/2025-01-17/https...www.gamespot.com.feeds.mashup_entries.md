<p>Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.</p><p>Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview">extended explanation</a> about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H1SNkcEU9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <ifra

Some of the most popular and beloved RPG series are slated to receive new entries, alongside remakes of all-time classics, and promising new ideas that could blossom into franchises of their own. RPGs have become an especially flexible genre in recent years, encompassing a wide range of stories and mechanics. That means that whether you're looking for a swords-and-sorcery epic, a far-flung future in space, or even just the ability to set up shop and live in a fantasy world, there's something for you to enjoy this year.</p><p dir="ltr">This year's slate of RPGs comes at an interesting time for the industry, as well.

And by "play as Godzilla," I mean you will be taller than the tallest building in Seaport City, and will have the ability to crush every building and build on the map by stepping on it or firing off Godzilla's laser breath.</p><p>It's similar to how the playable Doctor Doom worked during Chapter 5 Season 4, except you'll be even taller than the giant Doom was.

<p>About halfway into Act 3 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a>, you might come across some differently colored mushrooms as loot drops. These mushrooms are highlighted in green, so you know they're for some kind of quest, but the game doesn't explain in the slightest how to use them or where to bring them.</p><p>Fortunately, the mushrooms do have a distinct purpose in Path of Exile 2. You also don't need to travel far to find what they're used for, which offers a sweet reward after everything is said and done. However, things aren't as simple as they seem, as you need to find more than just a single mushroom and they're not too common of a drop.</p><h2>How to get Mushrooms in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Mushrooms come in three separate colors, and they're all different loot drops. The three colors of mushrooms are blue, green, and red. When they drop on the ground, you'll be able to see what color they are before adding them to your inventory.

<p>Movie fans worldwide were shocked to hear of influential filmmaker David Lynch's death this week. Just 78 years old at the time of his passing--he would have turned 79 on January 20--Lynch rose to prominence with films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and the cult-hit TV series Twin Peaks across the '80s and '90s.</p><p>While his strange and surreal approach to filmmaking would inspire several other big names in Hollywood, Lynch also had an impact on video games, with numerous titles having (or claiming to have) a Lynchian feel to their design. One video game series that he has a surprising connection to? Nintendo's Legend of Zelda games, as various key creatives behind the series cited Twin Peaks as a catalyst behind some of the weirder elements in several Zelda games.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2e7f2uvcguv4d5qxqnyjmk32/app.bsky.feed.post/3lfuwp44iy22w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiaaagpdydeat7sqfcpfx2d5up5eqzmfq7ljf7e

<p>Bungie has revealed a bunch of new abilities and balance changes that will be released with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s next episode, Heresy. The content update will include a brand-new verb, Bolt Charge, for the Arc subclass, as well as three new Aspects that can utilize the verb.</p><p>According to the Abilities team's notes, Bolt Charge was designed to be a powerful damage tool--something that was previously missing from the subclass. Bolt Charge is a stacking buff, which builds up over time to release a bolt of Arc lightning when it reaches its max. Stacks can be built up from multiple sources, and the verb will be integrated with Arc and Prismatic subclass suites.</p><p>"The loop of gaining a Bolt Charge stack, building it up through combat, and then receiving a big payoff ties deeply into the fantasy of Arc’s momentum-based gameplay," Bungie says of the new mechanic, saying it will open up plenty of new build-crafting options for the A
