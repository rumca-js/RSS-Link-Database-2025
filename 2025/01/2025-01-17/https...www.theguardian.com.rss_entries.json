It was supposed to be about Molly-Mae Hague\u2019s wedding to Tommy Fury, the man with whom she won Love Island in 2019, who was her partner for five years, and is the father of their daughter, Bambi. The couple got engaged in the summer of 2023 in Ibiza. You may have seen the video of his proposal; anything they do is tabloid catnip. But in August last year, she posted on Instagram that they had broken up. So instead, this has been repurposed into a documentary about Hague\u2019s new life as a single mother and a businesswoman, about to launch her first fashion brand.</p><p>It is not unfair to say that most people will be tuning in to find out the gossip. Such is the fuss around Hague and Fury that",
