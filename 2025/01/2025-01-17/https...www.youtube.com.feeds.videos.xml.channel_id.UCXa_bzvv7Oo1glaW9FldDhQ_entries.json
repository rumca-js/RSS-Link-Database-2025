        "description": "Even if  Hyper Light Breaker receives extensive balance updates, new content, an actual story to go with the setting, and a busier Overgrowth beyond relentlessly throwing enemies at you, it has some serious design issues. I see the potential in the world and combat, and the visuals, coupled with the music, are imbued with this unique otherworldly quality that few other games outside of this universe can replicate. \n\nHowever, for now, it's little more than a rough experiment which confuses progression for tedium.",

        "description": "Avowed is a first/third-person title where players venture to the Living Lands to combat the Dream Scourge. While you recruit different companions throughout your journey and make decisions to influence its direction, it's a bit different from the usual RPG fare.\n\nAvowed offers extensive freedom with builds, allowing players to mix and match weapons and skills based on their preferences. Dual-wield wands, or fight with a pistol and sword alongside companions - the choice is yours. Adding to this is an open zone design that rewards exploration and quests that organically react to your progress.\n\nLaunching on February 18th for Xbox Series X/S and PC, Avowed has more than its fair share of interesting mechanics and features to accompany the in-depth story. Here are 15 things you should know before picking it up.",
