<p>Parker Ortolani works near Grand Central and wrote a great post about the in-character <em>Severance</em> experience on Wednesday, replete with photos, both early in the day when the diorama was largely empty, and later in the day, when it was swarmed with fans and general onlookers because the actors and director Ben Stiller were there. Blogging at its best.</p>

<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are the changes included in iOS 18.3 for Apple Intelligence
notification summaries:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you enable notification summaries, iOS 18.3 will make it
clearer that the feature — like all Apple Intelligence features — is a beta.</p></li>
<li><p>You can now disable notification summaries for an app directly
from the Lock Screen or Notification Center by swiping, tapping
“Options,” then choosing the “Turn Off Summaries” option.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Lock Screen, notification summaries now use italicized
text to better distinguish them from normal notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Settings app, Apple now warns users that notification
summaries “may contain errors.”</p></li>

<p>Kyle Maclachlan, remembering his friend longtime collaborator David Lynch, on Instagram:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I saw in him was an enigmatic and intuitive man with a
creative ocean bursting forth inside of him. He was in touch with
something the rest of us wish we could get to.</p>

<p>Our friendship blossomed on <em>Blue Velvet</em> and then <em>Twin Peaks</em>
and I always found him to be the most authentically alive person
I’d ever met.</p>

<p>David was in tune with the universe and his own imagination on a
level that seemed to be the best version of human. He was not
interested in answers because he understood that questions are the
drive that make us who we are. They are our breath.</p>
