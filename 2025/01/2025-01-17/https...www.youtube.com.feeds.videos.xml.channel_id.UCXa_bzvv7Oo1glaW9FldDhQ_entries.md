After what may qualify as the most protracted lead up to the reveal of a console in recent memory, the Nintendo Switch 2 is officially here. Or, well, it will be some time this year, but at least it is formally confirmed now, meaning speculation can now move on from the hardware to the games – after all, the Switch 2 is not only going to get a whole new generation of games from Nintendo franchises and developers, but is also rumoured to get the most comprehensive third party support any Nintendo system has in decades. 

All of which is to say, there are many exciting projects and games rumoured to be in development for the Switch 2 – and here, we take a look at 15 of them.

Even if  Hyper Light Breaker receives extensive balance updates, new content, an actual story to go with the setting, and a busier Overgrowth beyond relentlessly throwing enemies at you, it has some serious design issues.

However, for now, it's little more than a rough experiment which confuses progression for tedium.

Avowed is a first/third-person title where players venture to the Living Lands to combat the Dream Scourge. While you recruit different companions throughout your journey and make decisions to influence its direction, it's a bit different from the usual RPG fare.

Avowed offers extensive freedom with builds, allowing players to mix and match weapons and skills based on their preferences. Dual-wield wands, or fight with a pistol and sword alongside companions - the choice is yours. Adding to this is an open zone design that rewards exploration and quests that organically react to your progress.

Launching on February 18th for Xbox Series X/S and PC, Avowed has more than its fair share of interesting mechanics and features to accompany the in-depth story. Here are 15 things you should know before picking it up.
