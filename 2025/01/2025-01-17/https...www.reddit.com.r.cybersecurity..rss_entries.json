        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m currently in the process of enrolling in WGU for a Bachelor&#39;s in Cybersecurity. My plan is to complete as many transferable credits/certificates before completing the classes they require, because there&#39;s many free/cheap options, and I&#39;d like to complete the degree as soon as possible. My question is, are any of the certifications listed <a href=\"https://www.wgu.edu/admissions/transfers/wgu-transcript-request/transferable-certifications.html\">here </a>available for free? Any advice and input would be great!
