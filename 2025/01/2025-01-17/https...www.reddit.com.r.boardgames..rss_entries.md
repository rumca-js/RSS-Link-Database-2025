<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m developing a board game and have a physical version done. I&#39;ve found someone who&#39;s happy to digitize it in a profit sharing arrangement.</p> <p>My question is - how much of the profit should I offer them?</p> <p>It&#39;s my original idea. I did mock ups, developed the rules, paid for artwork and did testing with players.</p> <p>But without digitizing I don&#39;t have a product to sell, and I can&#39;t afford to pay for it.</p> <p>I want to treat the digitizer (is that a word?!) fairly, but I don&#39;t want to unfairly disadvantage myself after all my hard work.</p> <p>I would appreciate hearing anyone&#39;s thoughts about this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/babamum"> /u/babamum </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i3u757/how_to_share_profit_on_a_new_board_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments

## Is there a better survival game than Robinson Crusoe?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Robinson Crusoe looks fun, but isn&#39;t quite what I&#39;m looking for. I like the surviving on an island theme and I like how much there is to do in Robinson Crusoe but, I don&#39;t know. There is just something about it that doesn&#39;t seem to scratch the right itch. I don&#39;t want zombies or apocalypses, just surviving in the wilderness. And only controlling one character, not multiple or a tribe. Honestly Robinson Crusoe might just be the best at there but I thought I would check. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shae_duane"> /u/shae_duane </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i3tugc/is_there_a_better_survival_game_than_robinson/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i3tugc/is_there_a_better_survival_game_than_robinson/">[comments]</a></span>

Spoilers for 1 specific game out of 1000s:</p> <p>Conference 1: Owl has 0-0 animals total SW of it (there might be nothing to SW) Conference 2: Owl is not NE of any Cuscus.</p> <p>You can check the app for the exact wording but that&#39;s the gist. The clues seem fine at first glance, but using the inverse, conference 1 can be rewritten as &quot;Owl is not NE of any animal&quot;. As a Cuscus is an animal, conference 2 is telling you what you already know, but worse because it&#39;s specifying only Cuscus, it&#39;s a subset of conference 1.</p> <p>I can imagine the type of ru

For me I the gold standard is Shut Up &amp; Sit Down’s ‘Top 100 Board Games of all Time’ review of Agricola. This worked so well for me as instead of being focused on rule reiterations or a simple recognition of which individual mechanics one likes and which they don’t, it really dug into the game as a text and the way the game mechanics create interesting game states that inspire a specific atmosphere to the playing of the game as well as specific ways the players relate to each other. </p> <p>I also like So Very Wrong About Games as they accomplish this as well, albeit to a lesser degree than that particular SU&amp;SD video which to me just felt like lightning in a bottle. I also subscribed to Senet for a year after it being recommended to me and really found it lacking in depth.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestion for board game journalism that reaches that quality?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Are there other board games that have a physical game, that is also integrated or connected to an app? Like, the physical materials and the app are part of the whole game?</p> <p>I loved a game called Escape Team where it basically combines the two. I was wondering if there are other games that are played the same way</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ratchu-Bu"> /u/Ratchu-Bu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i38vzi/physical_board_games_with_an_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i38vzi/physical_board_games_with_an_app/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to remember a board game that’s been described as basically Star Wars Rebellion but with a generic theme. I want to say I think it’s more of a smaller box. Does this sound familiar to anyone and if so can you give me the name? Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Brocktoon92"> /u/Brocktoon92 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i33d49/star_wars_rebellion_alternative/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i33d49/star_wars_rebellion_alternative/">[comments]</a></span>
