Here are my findings (hoping someone else can benefit too):</p> <p>For newer Intel CPUs, you want the p_state governor. This is because Intel CPUs of the Skylake/6th gen/6xxx family support hardware p-states. The feature is also called HWP or Speedshift. You definitely want this as it allows for the most optimized power/performance settings in most circumstances.</p> <p>Newer Kernels should use the p_state governor by default and set it to powersave. This is desirable in almost all circumstances, don&#39;t change it unless you really know what you are doing. Since the kernel sets this correctly by default, there is no need for tlp governor settings.</p> <p>You need to enable CPU_HWP_DYN_BOOST to profit from HWP*. There is little reason not to enable it for both BAT and AC.</p> <p>The setting you want",

I have had issues in the past with various distros so I could never put my finger on one. But this time, I installed Debian and it has been rock solid. The stability definately surprised me and the workflow is much smoother than windows for me. I&#39;m using my machine for general purpose work and coding and I have zero complains at this point. Really happy that I took the plunge!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/optimist_autist\"> /u/optimist_autist </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i3jqzu/finally_switched_to_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i3jqzu/finally_switched_to_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",
