We always hear people that they don\u2019t want biological men in women\u2019s space, I\u2019ve done my due diligence and used men\u2019s places as discretely as I can. So I am a frequent swimmer and of course have to change in a locker room, to avoid making anyone uncomfortable I use the men\u2019s. I however have been starred at, insulted, told I am in the wrong locker room, men in their act weird with me, cover themselves more, etc. I\u2019ve also always kept to myself, changed in stalls, use restroom in stalls, even swim in rash guard shirt instead of swim suit( this really makes it harder to do strokes like breast and butterfly). I\u2019ve done my best to be stealth about everything. Today was kinda a hard day, some man started yelling at me at the locker room and said a \u201cbiological female\u201d should not be in here and he was kicking me out. This dude was huge and I was a bit worried he was goi",
