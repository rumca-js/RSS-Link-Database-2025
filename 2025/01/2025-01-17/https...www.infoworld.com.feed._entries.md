<p>Let’s imagine a fictional company, Global Retail Corporation, a multinational retail chain struggling with its initial approach to AI integration. They built custom <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3689973/what-is-generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-that-creates.html">generative AI</a> applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI’s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a>) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal result

<p>In this week’s Python Report: Everyone’s favorite snake-named language is getting closer to being everyone’s favorite language, period. We also have a guide to unpacking the power of Python’s abstract base classes, and a tutorial for developers who want to use Cython to speed up their Python code. Or how about a deep dive into the whole extended family of Python distributions? Who knows, you might find the Python re-packaging that solves your trickiest problem yet.</p>

<p>Code migration is a critical process in maintaining software applications. It helps improve performance and resilience, keeps systems up to date, and removes stale or irrelevant code.</p>



<p>But it can be complex and time-consuming on a number of levels, not the least of which is the fact that the code is very often sprawled across a variety of environments. And, while AI has emerged to support a number of lower-level programming tasks, the technology has yet to be able to handle the convoluted, confusing job of code migration.</p>



<p>But now Google says it may have overcome that challenge, offering up a new step-by-step process and common toolkit in which large language models (LLMs) fin

<p>Google has formally introduced Vertex AI RAG Engine, a developer tool aimed at streamlining the complex process of retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and feeding it to an LLM (<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language model</a>).</p>
