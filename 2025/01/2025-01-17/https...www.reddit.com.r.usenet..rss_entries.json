Got charged a few days ago again, but this time its almost double! Obviously, I don&#39;t want to keep them. Just wondering if somebody experienced this! I signed up for Ultimate + VPN - 12 Month in 2019 on a promotion. It was supposed to be 30 EUR every year.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/eddi1984\"> /u/eddi1984 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i38mm3/charged_almost_double_for_tweaknewseu/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i38mm3/charged_almost_double_for_tweaknewseu/\">[comments]</a></span>",
