<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some questions that came to my mind last night: </p> <ol> <li>Who owns the copyright nowadays for the &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot; trilogy?</li> <li>Since the games are impressive titles for their times and get mentioned in the history of the Amiga 500 a lot, why is there no collection of those games for modern machines along with the artwork, remastered soundtrack and even the C64 version?</li> <li>There a Turrican collections with Amiga versions, Megaman collections and also the Castlevania ones from the 80s. Why not Shadow of the Beast?</li> <li>Wouldn&#39;t Shadow of the Beast for the Switch be an interesting idea? I am not sure if Sony owns the rights now. Would this be possible? Is there still interest in the game?</li> </ol> <p>Have a nice weekend!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fetito666"> /u/fetito666 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i3tove/shadow_of

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking for a quick and simple solution to pimp up my A500, I noticed this requires little fuss with regards to swapping out chip or modifying hardware. I also noticed that this upgrade it about 7 years old now. Are there any upgrades to this or should I just pick one up? Ideally like I&#39;d like to just run some WHDLoad games on the native hardware.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent_Memory_59"> /u/Consistent_Memory_59 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i3lqpq/aca500_plus_opinions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i3lqpq/aca500_plus_opinions/">[comments]</a></span>
