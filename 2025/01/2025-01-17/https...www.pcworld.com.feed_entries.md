<p>According to one analyst firm, the combined shipment of desktop and laptop computers in 2024 was 245.3 million units. That’s a big number — a new computer for one out of every thirty or so people on the planet — and it’s showing a growth over 2023. But with the previous post-pandemic slump in sales, and big pushes around AI and Windows 11, it still feels like a big disappointment.</p>



<p>The numbers <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-01-15-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-increased-1-point-4-percent-in-fourth-quarter-of-2024">come from Gartner</a>, which lays out a lot of statistics for the global and US markets broken down by major manufacturers. Apple’s Mac computers and ChromeOS devices are included. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Asus (9.8 percent growth), Acer, Apple, and Lenovo are the big winners in terms of total

<p>If you’ve been trying to somehow avoid the Windows 11 2024 Update, those days are over. Microsoft is now saying that mandatory Windows 11 24H2 updates have begun and the installation is lengthier than prior updates, so plan accordingly.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s status updates were made public on its “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2">Windows 11 known issues and notifications</a>” page, where the company said that it had reached a “new stage” in the roll out of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2490478/the-best-new-features-in-windows-11-version-24h2.html">the Windows 11 2024 Update</a>.</p>



<p>“We have reached a new stage in the phased rollout of version 24H2. Eligible devices running Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, versions 23H2 and 22H2 will be gradually updated to version 24H2,” Microso

<p>A few years ago, CyberPowerPC created a double-PC-in-a-box system called Pro Streamer — one to play games and one to stream them — which was a dream machine for the Twitch set.</p>



<p>But with the latest Thunderbolt capabilities, it’s now possible to easily replicate a lot of that functionality with a laptop and a single Thunderbolt cable. Keith May went hands-on at CES 2025 to demonstrate it.</p>

<p>Two days ago, Google announced that it was doing away with a separate upcharge for its Gemini AI features in Workspace and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2578255/google-couldnt-sell-ai-for-workspace-so-it-upped-the-price-and-bundled.html">forcing you to pay for it instead</a> whether you want AI or not. Today, Microsoft is following suit, raising prices for its Microsoft 365 packages by $3 per month and bundling in some Copilot AI tools to justify the bump.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/01/16/copilot-is-now-included-in-microsoft-365-personal-and-family/">In the announcement post</a>, Microsoft says that the price of Microsoft 365 will be rising from $7 to $10 per month for Personal subscribers and $10 to $13 per month for the Family bundle.

<p>It’s hard to have too many microSD cards. They’re needed for everything ranging from tablets to smartphones, dashcams to drones, Nintendo Switches to GoPros. It makes sense to grab a few for the future when you spot good ones on sale.</p>



<p>And right now, the Samsung Pro Ultimate microSD card is on sale. You can snatch the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Ultimate-microSDXC-MB-MY512SA-AM/dp/B0CF7QBT92/">512GB version for just $60 on Amazon</a>, a good 25 percent discount off its $80 MSRP. (If that’s too much space, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Ultimate-microSDXC-MB-MY512SA-AM/dp/B0CF7Z68YH/">128GB version is $22</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Ultimate-microSDXC-MB-MY512SA-AM/dp/B0CF82B8NN/">256GB version is $34</a>, or 19 percent off each.)</p>

<p>What does a massive $150 billion corporation do when a law forces it to make slightly less money? It takes its ball and goes home. At least, that’s what AT&T chose to do, ending a long saga of New York state attempting to enforce its affordable broadband law. AT&T has completely withdrawn its 5G home internet service from the state in retaliation.</p>



<p>Technically, this counts as compliance with the law in a “you are free to leave” sort of way. But not for lack of trying to get around it. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/att-complies-with-law-requiring-cheap-internet-by-ending-a-service-in-ny/">As Ars Technica reports</a>, the New York law requiring internet service providers to offer plans as cheap as $15 per month to qualifying low-income households was actually put on the books way back in 2021.
