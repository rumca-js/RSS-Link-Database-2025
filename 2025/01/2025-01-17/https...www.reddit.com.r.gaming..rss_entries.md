<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>[Spoilers for GOW 2018 and Kingdom Hearts 1] The greatest example of this I can think of is in GOW 2018 when you have those elemental demons you cant kill with your regular weapon without breaking out your fists and they break the flow of combat to where they are really a pain. Then the climactic moment happens in the game where you get the Chaos Blades and you annihilate swarms of these guys no problem while the game plays the old soundtrack music. Another example is the last level of Half Life 2 when the grav gun turns blue. An opposite example of this would be when you lose your keyblade in Kingdom Hearts.
