However, I\u2019ve run into a problem with getting my Ubisoft games to work, specifically <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey</em>. I bought it on Steam and used to launch it from there on Windows without any issues\u2014it would open Ubisoft Connect automatically, then start the game. Now, I can\u2019t seem to make it work on Linux, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going about this the right way.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried so far:</p> <ol> <li>Running the game directly from Steam using both Proton and Proton GE. Steam gives me an error saying \u201cUplay is not installed.\u201d</li> <li>Installed Ubisoft Connect through Lutris. It launches fine, and I can see the game in my library, but it\u2019s marked as \u201cNot Installed,\u201d even though the game is installed in the Steam directory under <code>~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Assassin",

Chop off your enemy&#39;s hands and they&#39;ll drop their weapons, slice off their feet and they&#39;ll fall over. Remove (all of) their head(s) and they&#39;ll die. Bleed them to death, poison them, light them on fire, it&#39;s up to you!</p> <p>Each of the seven levels contains different types of foes, from vampire bats to limb regenerating trolls, entangling octopi, dangerous giant spiders with webs and poison, zombies, and mechanical enemies left over by the dwarves. You will need to examine your enemies closely to figure out their weaknesses if you want to survive.</p> <p>Use magic to gain an edge on your foes. Some of the dozens of spells included are:</p> <p>- <strong>Graft Limb</strong>: Lost a foot? Need an extra arm? Want a spare head? Simply graft an enemy&#39;s chopped off limb onto your own body.</p> <p>- <strong>A Way Home</strong>: Opens a mag",

Seeing as Epic uploaded the UT games to Internet Archive, they don&#39;t have a problem with their game being shared. Can somebody provide me a link to the archive I should use? I&#39;ve used 3 different downloads and still no luck. So any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p> <p>UPDATE: So I was able to run the Linux binary included in the ut2004 archive and it runs. And I have it configured for fullscreen. But this still doesn&#39;t solve the issue with the launcher in Discovery. Not to mention it cranks down the desktop resolution every time I exit the game.
