<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Perhaps it&#39;s just my bad judgment or luck, but so many books I&#39;ve come across last little while try to be like action movies, constantly playing with your emotions and not giving you a chance to catch your breath.</p> <p>I sometimes almost want to shout, &quot;Be quiet and let me think!&quot; What I mean to say is give me the space I need to digest this and when I&#39;m ready I will continue reading. Maybe book like this are all a sign of a writer who is not confident in themself, somebody who thinks that if they&#39;re not entertaining the reader, if they&#39;re not shocking or hilarious or weird or disgusting, they will lose the reader. Because unlike with a movie, it&#39;s much easier to DNF a book. Reading a book requires a lot more effort than passively absorbing a movie.</p> <p>So I kind of get it. But it doesn&#39;t make reading any more pleasant. In the beginning, yes, I mean it&#39;s like junk food. Can&#39;t resist it initially, but

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For whatever reason I&#39;ve been remembering that book a lot these days. I don&#39;t hear about it- it&#39;s certainly not being made into some flashy Netflix show or Hollywood movie. It was set if I remember rightly in the suburbia of New York, in a Polish neighbourhood. The five-year old younger sister of the narrator, herself perhaps ten or eleven, was convinced she was a horse. She pranced and trotted everywhere, and refused to talk, only neighing. </p> <p>Everybody seemed to more or less accept this. I think there was one minor bullying incident. I can&#39;t remember the sisters&#39; names. I remember the loving description of a magnificent Polish picnic feast spread out outside, with an incredible watermelon on a hot summer day. </p> <p>A chunk of concrete broke off a balcony on the elder sister&#39;s head, giving her concussion and a bandaged head for ten days. This was vividly illustrated with a simple pencil line drawing. </p> <p>During tho

I always find creases, crumpled corners, etc. I know mail carriers aren&#39;t in the wrong (most of the time) cause they have no idea what is in the package, but the sellers need to pack their stuff better.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all!</p> <p>So being that the first book I&#39;ve read in 2025 was <em>Hear The Wind Sing</em> by Murakami, I decided to follow it up with <em>Pinball</em> which is an extension of <em>Wind</em> anyway. And with my goal of reading a book a week, this one made sense at 200(ish) pages. A few observations...</p> <p>Like <em>Wind, Pinball</em> was also light on plot. It doesn&#39;t matter with Murakami. The prose in describing the most common, everyday, serene scenes is just perfect for my liking. I can read on and on about Rat just sitting in J&#39;s Bar, drinking away his thoughts. The conversations here between Rat and J are both somehow meaningless and impactful. Murakami just seems so peak in his ability to make a mundane scene so atmospheric and purposeful. I am really enjoying this journey reading his work, and I know <em>Wind</em> and <em>Pinball</em> are just appetizers. Just don&#39;t ask any questions about what you read, go with the flo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished <em>The Remains of the Day.</em> It wrecked me. It is such a subtle, beautiful story. I feel such sympathy for Stevens, and I also love how complex he is.</p> <p>This may be one of the best examples of &quot;The fatal flaw&quot; that I&#39;ve seen in literature. Stevens&#39; actions (or rather inactions) lead to his eventual unhappiness and lack of fulfillment. Of course, one sees the ending coming throughout most of the novel. Still, one can&#39;t help but root for a different ending or imagine he and Ms. Kent reuniting--however obviously unlikely that possibility may seem. </p> <p>When I first read the ending, with Stevens committing to work harder on his bantering skills, I found it to be quite a sad moment. From my view, Stevens had not yet learned his lesson that being a &quot;great butler&quot; would not make him feel fulfilled, and I was rather upset to see the book ending with Stevens&#39; mind still upon his duties. </p> <p>H
