        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Still learning the ropes, but it&#39;s it possible to set things up so I can run a program through a VPN while still having access to files on the local machine and network. Would be setup on Windows 11 if that helps. Also would the VPN even be worth it since it has to go through the main OS so would it just show as the local machine? Seems like a lot, but I&#39;m not sure how I would do it or if it could even be done right. </p> <p>Thanks for any help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nemesis0884\"> /u/nemesis0884 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1i39h25/vpn_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1i39h25/vpn_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ok, I&#39;m not sure what to do here and I&#39;m at my wits end. Every time I try and add my Synology Bay drives to the File Sharing in Docker Desktop and hit apply, it immediately deletes them and sometimes it crashes the entire docker instance saying it can&#39;t find them. However, I know for sure I&#39;m putting in the right path. In my terminal under Volumes, there are Movies and Shows. If I try and put /Volume/Movies or /Volume/Shows it just doesn&#39;t work. I tried via a docker-compose file it fails saying I don&#39;t have permissions to `mkdir` via the /host_mnt/Volumes/Movies or whatever, which doesn&#39;t make sense to me because it&#39;s right there. What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/valtro05\"> /u/valtro05 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1i33d3k/unable_to_use_synology_bay_in_file_sharing_mac_os/\">[link]</a",
