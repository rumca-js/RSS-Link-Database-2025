I thought I had blocked the sender that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t showing up. I looked previous emails from the same website, specifically the first one when I created an account. In the email there was a cta button to login to account but instead of opening the browser, it downloaded a .bin file.</p> <p>The email seemed legit because at the same time when I created the account I received another email for further confirmation.</p> <p>Anyway I didnt open the .bin file, just deleted. My question is, can a .bin file be harmful even not opening it?</p> <p>Also it seems the email they used when I created the acc is no longer used since its been 5 years. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maresso\"> /u/maresso </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i3oenh/do",
