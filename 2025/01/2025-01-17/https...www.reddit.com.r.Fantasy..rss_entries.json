Examples of this can be seen in the X-Men, Dragon Age, The Fifth Season etc.</p> <p>I agree with the author that this makes absolutely no sense.

They&#39;re good early chapter books with an illustration on every page, simple sentences, fun adventures, and relatively short (about 100 pages). He&#39;s been reading about two or three a day and is now on book 24 of 27. We also have the collected 28 volumes of the Magic Treehouse: Merlin Missions, but I imagine this won&#39;t keep him busy for too long either.</p> <p>We&#39;ve been talking about trying a longer book. Redwall was something I was considering, but it does feel like a bit of a leap to go from 100 pages with illustrations to 300+ without any illustrations. </p> <p>Along with Dragon Masters, he loves spooky, creepy books. Loves monsters, gods, ghosts, zombies, vampires, etc as well. </p> <p>So I&#39;m curious what people would recommend for someone his age.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
