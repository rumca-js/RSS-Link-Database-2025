<p>Burnley missed out on the chance to go top of the Championship but have goalkeeper James Trafford to thank for keeping them in second after he saved two late penalties from Wilson Isidor against Sunderland in a goalless draw.</p><p>If Isidor had scored from the spot, it would have sent the Black Cats above the Clarets and a point behind the leaders Leeds. Burnley’s promotion push is starting to feel like a grind, having scored once in their past four Championship matches as they aim to make life hard for themselves in search of a return to the Premier League, although their defensive record is now a very boastful nine conceded in 27 games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/17/burnley-sunderland-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aberdeen missed out on the striker on their doorstep who Sir Alex Ferguson regards as Scotland’s greatest ever player</p><p>15 April 1967 is a date implanted in the mind of any Scotland supporter who wants to declare their team unofficial world champions. The 3-2 victory over Alf Ramsey’s all-conquering England at Wembley is about as good as it has ever got. Denis Law had already missed a sitter from Willie Wallace’s cross by the time he put the visitors in front. Jim Baxter roamed from midfield, Wallace fired towards goal and, following brief ping-pong inside the England penalty area, Law slammed home. Scotland had fretted that Law might not be fit to play in the Home Championship match; he was to be part of a team celebrated over decades.</p><p>It is the same fixture at Hampden Park in 1966, though, that better epitomises Law. The forward is already mid-air to meet Willie Johnston’s corner by the time Bobby Moore sees fit to move. George Cohen and Gordon Banks are statuesque on

<p>Engineer whose trigger probe made his company Renishaw a world leader in measuring for hi-tech mass production</p><p>In engineering, quantity production is possible only with fine, repeatable measurements. Starting from a problem in aerospace, David McMurtry, who has died aged 84, did much to advance the scientific study of measurement – metrology – and so facilitated hi-tech mass production in many fields.</p><p>While working for Rolls-Royce in 1972 at its Filton factory, near Bristol, on the Olympus engines used in the Concorde supersonic airliner, McMurtry became frustrated with the foibles of the existing coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). One morning he arrived at work with a home-modified measuring probe that could cope with the complex task of properly measuring the twisting aerofoils of the Olympus fan blades – data needed to ensure that engine reached the required performance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/17/david-mcmurty-obituary">Conti

<p>A goalscorer with a courageous flamboyance, Manchester United’s ace also pioneered the signature celebration</p><p>Whoever first described football as the working man’s ballet – it may have been Tony Waddington, the long-serving Stoke City manager – they were surely thinking of Denis Law, whose balance and agility inside an opposition penalty area would have brought a cheer from Nijinsky or Baryshnikov.</p><p>Even on the sort of gloomy midwinter day when an English football stadium could seem, in the pre-modern era, to be a dark and glowering place, Law shone through the murk, and not just for the bright red of his Manchester United jersey and the white of his shorts. A shock of straw-coloured hair made him stand out in every opposing team’s penalty area even when he wasn’t spontaneously arranging his limbs to execute a spectacular aerial volley.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/17/denis-law-superstar-extrovert-flourish-manchester-united">Continue reading

<p>The great American film-maker died this week, leaving behind a body of work unmatched in its seductive strangeness and transcendent mystery. We put it in order</p><p>It is one of life’s eternal mysteries that for the last two decades of his life, no one was willing to fund another feature by America’s greatest film-maker of the time. Almost as much of a mystery was his final completed feature: the evil twin of his previous film, Mulholland Drive. As Laura Dern’s hexed actor segues into the character she is playing, this digitally shot rampage down Hollywood’s boulevard of broken dreams dials up the narrative fragmentation of his late period. It runs the gamut from inspired camcorder surrealism to making-it-up-as-you-go-along incoherence (which is what it was: Lynch shot without a finished screenplay).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/17/david-lynch-films-and-tv-shows-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When my grief was new and raw, I discovered that feeling it was preferable to the numbness that had set in since we’d buried them</p><p>Last week, I swam in the sea, slowly wading in until the water reached my hips, and then diving under the softly rippling waves.

Anyone who’s spent a summer in Victoria knows the kind of day that marks the end of a heatwave. It starts off hot, everyone kicking off their bedcovers before it’s time to get up.

<p>Planting seeds, rather than bulbs, is cheaper, and there are more varieties to choose from</p><p>There are several reasons I shy away from growing onions: how much space they take up and how small my plot is; how long they need to stay in the ground; and given how inexpensive they are, why bother? But if you’ve started the year with a&nbsp;hankering to begin the growing season, starting onions from seed is a&nbsp;task you can do&nbsp;now.</p><p>Many gardeners will be waiting until spring to start off their onions from sets (small, immature bulbs ready for planting), but growing from seed is a less expensive approach, plus there’s a wider range of varieties to choose from. As with any crop started from seed, it is more labour intensive. But if you’re anything like me, you’ll enjoy the challenge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/17/cant-wait-for-spring-to-get-growing-in-the-garden-then-make-sure-you-know-your-onions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are fears that landlords will capitalise on the last remaining no-fault evictions, and increase rents before the new scheme comes into effect</p><p>Last month, I was working with a young homeless family on England’s south coast. The local council had found them a privately rented flat with an agreed rent, and provided a “landlord incentive” payment of £1,500. But, when the council emailed the landlord to confirm the arrangements, he replied to say that he was increasing the rent by £100 a month because “the market is moving in that direction”.</p><p>The property was mortgage-free, so the price hike could not be blamed on rising costs. This is not uncommon: <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/property-news/how-higher-mortgage-rates-are-hitting-landlords/">Zoopla estimates</a> that 70% of landlords have either no debt or a small mortgage.

This is the stage you are on, so dress for it.</p><p>Imagine your life is a movie, and you are the costume designer. What would you pull out of your wardrobe tomorrow morning? You would start, I&nbsp;think, by establishing character. This sounds far-fetched, but it’s just a fancy term for what you do already even if you don’t consciously define it as such, which is tell people a bit about who you are via what you wear. There are a&nbsp;few basics to factor in next – keeping warm, staying dry, is there time to iron that – before your thoughts naturally move toward what’s on your schedule. Some days have clear plot

<p><strong>(PIAS)</strong><br>The London musician’s assured debut runs the gamut from aggressive jungle to uplifting house, toggling between hedonism and introspection</p><p>The last few years have proved tricky for female-fronted dance-pop, with interesting artists wasting away as guest vocalists on songs credited to male DJs with perfect teeth, or siloed into dead ends soundtracked by an efficient amalgam of drum’n’bass and sticky-floor EDM.</p><p>Thank goodness, then, for London’s Rose Gray, whose sweat-soaked debut album fizzes with inventiveness. She’s clearly a fan of dance music’s more experimental potential – opener Damn is an aggressively filtered jungle onslaught, while collaborators include producer Sega Bodega (Caroline Polachek, Shygirl) and electropop cult figure Uffie. But Gray also understands pop, with the campy Angel of Satisfaction stomping around a keening, early Gaga-esque chorus. The house-inflected Party People, meanwhile, would have nestled nicely on an 00s Ib

<p>The Love Island star offers her thoughts on pyjamas, her fashion brand, her favourite order at McDonald’s … in a TV show that’s surprisingly carefully produced</p><p>Molly-Mae: Behind It All is a Keep Calm and Carry On poster in the form of a beige, hyperbolic, strangely enthralling documentary. It was supposed to be about Molly-Mae Hague’s wedding to Tommy Fury, the man with whom she won Love Island in 2019, who was her partner for five years, and is the father of their daughter, Bambi. The couple got engaged in the summer of 2023 in Ibiza. You may have seen the video of his proposal; anything they do is tabloid catnip. But in August last year, she posted on Instagram that they had broken up. So instead, this has been repurposed into a documentary about Hague’s new life as a single mother and a businesswoman, about to launch her first fashion brand.</p><p>It is not unfair to say that most people will be tuning in to find out the gossip. Such is the fuss around Hague and Fury that
