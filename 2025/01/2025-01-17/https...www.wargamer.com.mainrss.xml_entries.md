								<p>If regular <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> is just a bit too predictable, safe, and square for your tastes, may I recommend The Painted Wastelands? Written by Chris Willett and illustrated by Tim Molloy, this hex-crawl mini-setting has an atmosphere that’s halfway between the Outlands in Planescape and the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, carried by vibes that are equal parts Star Wars and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</p>
