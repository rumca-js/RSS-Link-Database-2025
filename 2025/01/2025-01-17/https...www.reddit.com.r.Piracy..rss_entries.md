<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To add some context, I am new here and have gone through the glorious megathread. I&#39;ve found SteamRIP to be the site I like to use the most and have downloaded of couple games using the buzzheavier download link. However, the game &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&quot; only has one working direct download through &quot;GoFile&quot; because buzzheavier gets a &quot;not found&quot; error when trying to download. &quot;GoFile&quot; seems a little bit sketchy to my gut. So, my question is simple: Even though SteamRIP is trusted, in the megathread and generally pre-installed games. Are all the links and sites I can direct download from safe to use or do I have to be careful and sometimes follow my gut here?<br/> I really appreciate helpful answers.

I won’t be downloading it just clicking play and watching the movie. It’s my understanding google drive scans for viruses/malware before even allowing a file to be uploaded(?) but how risky would it be? And if i copy and paste the link into virustotal to check and there WAS some kind of malware or something would i get infected just from the copying and pasting process alone? Sorry if this is a stupid question lol</p
