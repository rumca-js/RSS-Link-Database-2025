This succulent originates from west Africa, where it&nbsp;thrives in bright, indirect light and&nbsp;is&nbsp;adapted to arid environments. The technical term for this issue is etiolation \u2013&nbsp;when a plant doesn\u2019t receive enough light, it stretches towards the light source, resulting in elongated growth and paler colouring as it tries to maximise photosynthesis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/17/houseplant-clinic-help-my-cactus-is-spindly-and-pale\">Continue reading...</a>",

I saw the Beatles when I was eight. By the time I was nine, I had a band. Started with a little cheap guitar and then got a drum kit, which my father hated. I was playing pretty big concerts by the time I was 16 and then went on tour. I became a roadie from 18 to about 22. I went to LA to play music, accidentally got into acting.

After turning what would have been an ugly fumble deep in his own half into the beginning of a run of 23 unanswered points against the Los Angeles Chargers last week, Houston\u2019s quarterback seemed to shake off his winter blues at the very moment he found Xavier Hutchinson wide open downfield. Stroud needs to trust his instincts in order to compensate for a subpar offensive line, though more importantly he has to have faith in Nico Collins. The receiver will be under blanket coverage from Trent McDuffie and Justin Reid, owing to a lack of any other significant Texans threat downfield, but his remarkable knack of making catches in heavy traffic will be crucial if his team are to keep pace with the Chiefs.
