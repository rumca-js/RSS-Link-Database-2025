<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that Google makes little effort to self-police their own ads, so I&#39;ve started reporting them. By my estimation, half of the ads that they show during YouTube shorts are non-compliant. What constitutes an illegal ad is different depending on where you live. The United States has these laws for example, not including the local/state laws: </p> <ol> <li>False Advertising: Misleading claims or exaggerations about products or services.</li> <li>Bait-and-Switch Advertising: Advertising a product, then offering a different one (Like those fake game ads)</li> <li>Manipulative Use of Children: Exploiting children’s lack of marketing understanding or pressuring purchases. This is unrelated to the COPPA status of the video. (COPPA is California, but this rule is national)</li> <li>&quot;Scam&quot; or &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot; Schemes: Promoting fraudulent investment or pyramid schemes.</li> </ol> <p>Gambling ads are often illegal depending

HOWEVER, when i listen to music on the platform, its usually 1 or 2 ads before it plays. That to me is WAY more tolerable. Something i just want to point out and ask is, why is there SO MANY ad blockers? I personally don&#39;t trust the vast majority of them.
