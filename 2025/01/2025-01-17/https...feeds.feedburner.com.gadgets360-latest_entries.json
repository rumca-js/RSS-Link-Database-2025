Located 2,800 light-years away, this star is part of a triple-star system and has an unusual evolutionary history. The blue lurker\u2019s accelerated spin, taking just four days, contrasts with the typical rotation of Sun-like stars. The star\u2019s rapid rotation stems from material transfer after a stellar merger. Hubble's ultraviolet measurements of the system's white dwarf companion provide valuable data on stellar evolution, highlighting the significance of triple-star systems in astrophysical research",
