Lightning Talk: Guess what? - Global Farming Practices Degrade Soil Health - Shruti Aggarwal - ACCU 2024

I discuss the critical importance of soil health and its role in sustaining life on Earth and I highlight the alarming rate at which healthy soil is being degraded globally due to unsustainable farming practices.

The ACCU Conference is the annual conference of the ACCU membership, but is open to any and all who wish to attend. The tagline for the ACCU is 'Professionalism in Programming', which captures the whole spectrum of programming languages, tools, techniques and processes involved in advancing our craft. While there remains a core of C and C++ - with many members participating in respective ISO standards bodies - the conference, like the organisation, embraces other language ecosystems and you should expect to see sessions on C#, D, F#, Go, Javascript, Haskell, Java, Kotlin, Lisp, Python, R
