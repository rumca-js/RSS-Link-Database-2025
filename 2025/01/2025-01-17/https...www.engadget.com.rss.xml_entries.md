<p>On Thursday, <em>The New York Times </em>published a <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html" data-original-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump.html"><ins>lengthy story</ins></a> about the rise in power of Stephen Miller, a longtime loyalist of Donald Trump known for his hardline views on immigration. Normally, a story like that wouldn’t get much attention in the tech press. But the piece opened with an anecdote about Mark Zuckerberg that immediately raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>The story detailed a recent meeting Miller had with Zuckerberg when the Meta CEO traveled to Mar-a-Lago last year.

<p>As the world turns, so do the console generations. The Nintendo Switch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-01-nintendo-switch-review.html">is over seven years old</a>, so it’s due for a refresh.

<p>The Switch 2 looks functionally very similar to the original system, albeit with a larger display, magnetic Joy-Cons and a sleeker design. The company also reaffirmed that the upcoming console will be backwards compatible with Switch games.&nbsp;</

However, Android phone makers haven’t exactly been rushing to add Qi2 support to their latest devices since then. That’s made finding a compatible handset rather difficult, which is a bummer for anyone who has seen the wealth of accessories and power banks that iPhone owners have had for several generations.</p>
<p>On top of faster charging speeds (up to 15 watts or higher in later revisions), Qi2 dictates the inclusion of embedded magnets designed to make aligning and attaching peripherals a cinch.</p>
