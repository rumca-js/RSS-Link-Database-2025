At present I find myself with a Vive Pro 2 being pushed with a 4090.</p> <p>I have always read and to an extent experienced firsthand discrepancies with refresh rates and reprojection. At times the higher refresh rate seems to feel better, despite occasionally or even frequently falling short of the performance target. Old wisdom has also stated that if you know you&#39;ll fall short, try to lock in to half the target rate (45 reprojected for 90hz, 60 reprojected for 120, etc.).</p> <p>In the last few years, the only thing I use my HMD for is sim racing, which can be notoriously finnicky on the performance front depending on many factors (visible cars, lighting, headlights, weather, etc.). In a perfect world I hit a smooth 120hz and live in paradise, but this is not that world.</p> <p>My question is if theoretically you have a sim where your best case scenario is 50-65",

In terms of weight it is about the same unfortunately and we will talk about that when we get to the comfort section. The upgrades come in the visuals. The headset now features a higher resolution of 3840\u00d73840pixels per eye.

All the competition that has been made so far (can only think of like 2 or 3, lol) has had either terrible support or terrible features. Now that there&#39;s more light house tracked vr headsets easily available in the used market (lot of old Vives, Vive Pros, or Indexes without controllers), it&#39;d be nice to see more controller options than basically just Vive wands and Index controllers (still too expensive 5+ years later, even on the used market). </p> <p>Will there ever be more cheaper lighthouse controller options out there?

I still can&#39;t get excited about it as Immersed Visor is NOT a multipurpose VR headset. Out of the box it ONLY launches the Immersed app. There&#39;s no app store for games/apps and you cannot use it for PC VR as that functionality isn&#39;t developed. You might be able to sideload apps as it&#39;s currently built on top of Snapdragon Spaces",

Everything works the way it should and the combat is fun and engaging. Switching weapons between short range, long range and melee weapon works great and you can mix up any 2 weapons and change up your play style at any given time, creating great gameplay moments. Enemy Ai is also intuitive, as some will fire from long range and take cover, some will flank you and others will use all sorts of gadgets and powers to knock you all over the battlefield or just hold you in place. </p> <p>Every gun has 2 handed mode with manual reload. The guns look and feel great to hold and impressive use of psvr2\u2019s adaptive triggers and headset rumble really sets each gun mods apart and a joy to use. </p> <p>The game looks stunning and hard to believe that it was developed by only 4 people. Audio and Visual is on par with any AAA vr title. </p> <p>Only negatives I have for this game ",
