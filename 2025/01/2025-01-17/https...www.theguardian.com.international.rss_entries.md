<ul><li>Dubai-based Scot Ewen Ferguson leads way on 12 under</li><li>Jon Rahm’s struggles cause a surprise after dismal 77</li></ul><p>For a spell on Friday afternoon the organisers of the Dubai Desert Classic had cause for panic. Jon Rahm had already tumbled out of the tournament after 36 holes, Viktor Hovland was heading the same way and Rory McIlroy was dangerously close to the cut line. Not for the first time at the Emirates Club, McIlroy saved the day; a birdie at the 18th meant he survived for the weekend with three shots to spare. Given McIlroy’s specialism here – he is seeking a third win in a row – a deficit of nine to the leader, Ewen Ferguson, is unlikely to faze the Northern Irishman.</p><p>Rahm’s struggles on his first start of 2025 and debut in this tournament caused widespread shock.

I saw the Beatles when I was eight. By the time I was nine, I had a band. Started with a little cheap guitar and then got a drum kit, which my father hated. I was playing pretty big concerts by the time I was 16 and then went on tour. I became a roadie from 18 to about 22. I went to LA to play music, accidentally got into acting. I’m still not sure how it happened.

<p>The best weekend in football whirls into action with Kansas City starting their bid for a three-peat and ends with a blockbuster meeting of MVP candidate</p><p><strong>What the Texans need to do to win:</strong> CJ Stroud needs to continue his upward trajectory. After turning what would have been an ugly fumble deep in his own half into the beginning of a run of 23 unanswered points against the Los Angeles Chargers last week, Houston’s quarterback seemed to shake off his winter blues at the very moment he found Xavier Hutchinson wide open downfield. Stroud needs to trust his instincts in order to compensate for a subpar offensive line, though more importantly he has to have faith in Nico Collins. The receiver will be under blanket coverage from Trent McDuffie and Justin Reid, owing to a lack of any other significant Texans threat downfield, but his remarkable knack of making catches in heavy traffic will be crucial if his team are to keep pace with the Chiefs. Oh, and in games tha
