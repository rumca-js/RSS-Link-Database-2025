When it comes to hardware sales, Nintendo usually doesn't fail. From the smash success of the DS line, all the way back to their roots with the NES and even some of their more unorthodox hardware. It's hard to think of a Nintendo console not doing well. While the Switch has proven to be a financial and critical success in every way possible, it wasn't that long ago when Nintendo’s hardware was in a tough position with low sales, mediocre software, and a general lack of interest in the Wii U. In this episode of IGN Rewind, we dive into how the missteps of the Wii's successor paved the way for the creation of one of the best-selling consoles of all time—the Nintendo Switch.

Dracula. The Frankenstein Monster. The Invisible Man. The Mummy. And oh yes, don’t forget the Wolf Man.

Well, grab your torches, pick your wolfsbane, and ready your stakes – and your ability to read into the metaphors behind monster stories – because we spoke to Whannell about the influences of classic monster movies on his work, how to revive beloved creatures like the Wolf Ma
