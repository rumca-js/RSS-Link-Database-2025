## Show HN: Compile C to Not Gates

<p>Hi! I've been working on the flipjump project, a programming language with 1 opcode: flip (invert) a bit, then jump (unconditionally). So a bit-flip followed by more bit-flips. It's effectively a bunch of NOT gates.
This language, as poor as it sounds, is RICH.<p>Today I completed my compiler from C to FlipJump. It takes C files, and compiles them into flipjump. I finished testing it all today, and it works!
My key interest in this project is to stretch what we know of computing and to prove that anything can be done even with minimal power.<p>I appreciate you reading my announcement, and be happy to answer questions.<p>More links:<p>- The flipjump language: <a href="https://github.com/tomhea/flip-jump">https://github.com/tomhea/flip-jump</a> <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/FlipJump" rel="nofollow">https://esolangs.org/wiki/FlipJump</a><p>- c2fj python package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/c2fj/" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.org/project/c2fj/</a></p>

<p>Hey HN! I'm a solo developer who's been building web apps for the past two years. I kept seeing other devs struggle with clunky credit systems for usage-based pricing.<p>So, I decided to build Creduse: a robust API that makes integrating usage-based pricing into your web app very easy. It records every credit-related action as an immutable transaction in a ledger (nope, no blockchain involved), so you don't have to worry about data integrity or complex accounting.<p>Is this something you'd find useful for your projects? What features would make it even better for your projects?</p>

<p>I’ve spent almost two decades in digital-focused roles, specialising in strategy, user research, and creating frameworks for better customer experiences (ostensibly UX I suppose).<p>While I’ve found the work rewarding, I feel it’s time for a significant career change—potentially outside of this domain entirely.<p>I’m seeking advice from others who have made mid-career transitions:<p>• How did you pinpoint new directions that matched your skills and interests?<p>• What were the most effective ways to reposition your experience in a new field?<p>• Are there any resources or strategies you’d recommend for upskilling or building networks?<p>I've often thought about cybersecurity as something I'd like to specialise in, but it seems like bootcamps and the like aren't worth the money they charge (most advice has been starting at the bottom as an IT helpdesk worker and going from there, but I'm no spring chicken anymore.
