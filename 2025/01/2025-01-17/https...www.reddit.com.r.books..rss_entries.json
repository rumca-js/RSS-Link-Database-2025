Maybe book like this are all a sign of a writer who is not confident in themself, somebody who thinks that if they&#39;re not entertaining the reader, if they&#39;re not shocking or hilarious or weird or disgusting, they will lose the reader. Because unlike with a movie, it&#39;s much easier to DNF a book. Reading a book requires a lot more effort than passively absorbing a movie.</p> <p>So I kind of get it. But it doesn&#39;t make reading any more pleasant. In the beginning, yes, I mean it&#39;s like junk food. Can&#39;t resist it initially, but",

The five-year old younger sister of the narrator, herself perhaps ten or eleven, was convinced she was a horse. She pranced and trotted everywhere, and refused to talk, only neighing. </p> <p>Everybody seemed to more or less accept this. I think there was one minor bullying incident.

I remember the loving description of a magnificent Polish picnic feast spread out outside, with an incredible watermelon on a hot summer day. </p> <p>A chunk of concrete broke off a balcony on the elder sister&#39;s head, giving her concussion and a bandaged head for ten days. This was vividly illustrated with a simple pencil line drawing. </p> <p>During tho",

And with my goal of reading a book a week, this one made sense at 200(ish) pages. A few observations...</p> <p>Like <em>Wind, Pinball</em> was also light on plot. It doesn&#39;t matter with Murakami. The prose in describing the most common, everyday, serene scenes is just perfect for my liking. I can read on and on about Rat just sitting in J&#39;s Bar, drinking away his thoughts. The conversations here between Rat and J are both somehow meaningless and impactful. Murakami just seems so peak in his ability to make a mundane scene so atmospheric and purposeful. I am really enjoying this journey reading his work, and I know <em>Wind</em> and <em>Pinball</em> are just appetizers. Just don&#39;t ask any questions about what you read, go with the flo",

Stevens&#39; actions (or rather inactions) lead to his eventual unhappiness and lack of fulfillment. Of course, one sees the ending coming throughout most of the novel.

From my view, Stevens had not yet learned his lesson that being a &quot;great butler&quot; would not make him feel fulfilled, and I was rather upset to see the book ending with Stevens&#39; mind still upon his duties. </p> <p>H",
