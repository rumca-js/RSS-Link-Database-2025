## New to Degoogling, Trying Different Browsers, Confused AF

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As the title says, I&#39;m new to degoogling, but I want to do my part to fight back against the big tech monopolies, so I&#39;m working on switching to non-google products, including my browser. I&#39;ve used PaleMoon in the past, but the visuals are just so old. I&#39;m currently using Brave, but I don&#39;t like how hard they&#39;re pushing crypto and AI, plus I&#39;m reading mixed things about Chromium-based browsers. I know Firefox is not Chromium-based and is popular among degooglers, but I&#39;ve also read some posts here on reddit that Mozilla is not as great about privacy as they claim (though since I&#39;m so new I don&#39;t quite understand some of the arguments?). I might try Tor next? Anyway, it feels like every option has it&#39;s own problems, and everyone has extremely strong opinions about which is best. Does anyone have advice or recommendations? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user
