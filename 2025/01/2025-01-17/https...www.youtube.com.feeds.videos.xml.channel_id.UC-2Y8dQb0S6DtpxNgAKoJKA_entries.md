Coming July 2025 to PS5.

Developed by TeamKill Media, Code Violet is a Third-Person Action Horror game, where you take on the role of Violet Sinclair, a girl plucked from the past who must unravel the mysteries of the Aion Bioengineering Complex as she avoids, hides or fights against the creatures who have overrun it.  With the evacuation protocol in effect, Violetâ€™s main goal is to escape the complex and save those she cares for, but with the creatures and a mysterious Director doing all in their power to stop you, will you get out alive?

In the 25th Century it is said that mankind narrowly survived a cataclysm that left Earth uninhabitable and in ruins.  What was left of the human race looked to the stars for a new world:  Trappist 1-E, where they would rebuild and start again.

However, those who had survived the cataclysm, were sterile and could not produce children and without a solution mankind would soon go extinct.
