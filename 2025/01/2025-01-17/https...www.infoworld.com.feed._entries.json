It helps improve performance and resilience, keeps systems up to date, and removes stale or irrelevant code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it can be complex and time-consuming on a number of levels, not the least of which is the fact that the code is very often sprawled across a variety of environments. And, while AI has emerged to support a number of lower-level programming tasks, the technology has yet to be able to handle the convoluted, confusing job of code migration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now Google says it may have overcome that challenge, offering up a new step-by-step process and common toolkit in which large language models (LLMs) fin",
