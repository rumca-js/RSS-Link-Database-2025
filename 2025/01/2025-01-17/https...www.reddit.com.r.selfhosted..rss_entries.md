It runs the following: Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr, Bazarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, Transmission and Jellyseerr.

However, when I start streaming on Jellyfin (~2 streams, both transcoding), the RAM usage spikes up to almost the maximum (some media just 1 stream is enough), causing the VM to be unresponsive at times. The media does play but trying to load another instance of Jellyfin in another browser for example will just load continuously.</p> <p>Stopping the media streams an leaving it for a bit (~3-5mins) will bring everything back to normal.</p> <p>I have no idea what is going on and would love to see if anyone else had this issue.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I&#39;m currently a long-time LiquidWeb customer for what I believe is a managed VPS, and after an awful experience that&#39;s still ongoing concerning an outage to my website, I&#39;ve started looking for alternatives. Once I did a quick search of what else is out there, I quickly realized that I&#39;m currently paying WAY more than what I could get elsewhere. My current hardware (2 CPU, 2 GB of RAM) is insufficient, as I&#39;d need at least 4 GB of RAM and ideally 8+. I&#39;m getting that for the lovely price of $61 per month, so I&#39;d like suggestions for alternatives that are reliable, support is good and stable. I need a company that can handle upgrading things like PHP, as LW currently does that for me upon request, which is a managed VPS, based on my understanding. Any suggestions on another host that fits my criteria and for less than I&#39;m paying now on a monthly basis?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi
