It’ll pay a $20 million fine for allegedly violating U.S. children’s privacy laws and “deciev[ing] children and other users about the real costs of in-game translations and odds of obtaining rare prizes.” The company will also stop selling loot boxes to people under the age of 16 without parental consent.

The fact that the company seems to be playing it safe with its most conservative new console in years isn’t much of a surprise. What was surprising is just how lackluster the reveal itself was. But perhaps that’s because, for any tech-obsessive, the video Nintendo released looked eerily familiar. The brief three-minute trailer didn’t look like other game console reveals; instead it looked almost exactly like the sizzle reels Apple trots out for each year’s new iPhone. </p>
