As you can imagine I&#39;m very isolated, my friends have left me too, and I&#39;m more depressed! I enjoy comedy or series&#39; you can get into that are totally wacky or just really fun to read </p> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p> <p>\u2192 side note, currently I&#39;m reading Dead Astronauts by Jeff VanderMeer!
