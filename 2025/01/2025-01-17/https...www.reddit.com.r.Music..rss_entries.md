I was born in &#39;82 FWIW, but it seems to me, objectively, in the history of modern music we&#39;ve never had another 10 year span that has birthed as many diverse genres of music as the 10 year run from 1965-1975, which I guess is technically 11 years if we&#39;re talking Jan 1, 1965 - Dec 31, 1975, but if you wanted to call it June 1, 1965 - May 31, 1975 or something, to be really pendantic, go for it, and I believe every part of the discussion would still hold true.</p> <p>My point here is that in that 10 years that I&#39;m talking about, we see the birth and/or popularization of (and in some cases demise of), the following genres of music that are, generally speaking, all still around today:</p> <p>Funk, Jazz Fusion, Psychedelic Rock, Folk Rock, Country Rock, Prog Rock, Jam Rock, Punk Rock, Heavy Metal, New Wave, Glam Rock, Reggae, Hiphop, Disco, Electronic Music, Krautrock, Industrial music, and many other derivative subg

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone i&#39;m a music artist on a mission to release a new song (on soundcloud &amp; youtube) everyday for 100 days. I make anything from alternative, to experimental, to pop, to &quot;i dont even know what to call this&quot; music. i&#39;m on my 23rd song and i&#39;m still enjoying it. i&#39;ve been making visualizers to post on tiktok and instagram every single day all while working on a solo album one the 100 days is over. i have learned more than i ever thought i could in just three weeks. the only issue im running into is that some days i struggle to perfect the mix on songs due to feeling rushed and on little time after production, writing the lyrics, and recording but i&#39;m still having a ton of fun creating.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear what you all think of this and if you have any advice for staying constant.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/C0R3Y-"> /u/C0R3Y- </a> <br/> <span><a
