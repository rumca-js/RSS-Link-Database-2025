Joe Biden delivered his farewell address to the nation, where he went out of his way to give a warning about a tech oligarchy forming because of Elon Musk and others in the tech industry. Ben discusses why this part of his address is not true and serves as evidence that Biden has never contributed anything significant to this country. He also highlights Marco Rubio‚Äôs impressive performance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in prioritizing American interests in foreign policy.
