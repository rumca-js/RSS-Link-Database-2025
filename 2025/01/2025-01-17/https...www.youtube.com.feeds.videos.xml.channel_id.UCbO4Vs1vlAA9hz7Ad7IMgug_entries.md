Jordan and I are back as we work our way through the N5 Mission in the Infinity Universe book with the two brand new Armies for the latest edition of Infinity by Corvus Belli!

The city streets are turned into a warzone as a shipment of alien Archeotech is dropped onto the road. The JSA and Pan O Forces race to extract as much of it as possible while stopping the opposing force from doing the same!
