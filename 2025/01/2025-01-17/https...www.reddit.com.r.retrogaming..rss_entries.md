<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been revisiting TMNT and Double Dragon games recently, alternating between games. Next up for me is probably going to be Double Dragon II on NES. I remember playing this and actually beating it back when I was a kid on a Famicom and the only thing I didn&#39;t like about it was having buttons do attacks on the left and right, instead of fixing it to a punch and kick. It took a while for me to get used to it and I&#39;d still make mistakes every so often. Personally, I prefer Double Dragon III over II but that&#39;s because I played the easier Famicom version of III back then. I&#39;ve played and beaten the first and third Double Dragon games on NES recently so II completes the trilogy.</p> <p>What about you guys?

It’s going to be a fake movie trailer that parodies bad and cheesy Hollywood video game movies, inspired by films like Rampage, Pixels, and Super Mario Bros (1993). </p> <p>For the opening shot I wanted to use footage of a Game &amp; Watch Octopus unit, with the camera gradually zooming in on the diver collecting gold from the chest. Unfortunately I don’t own a unit and the prices are rather high, so I wanted to ask if anyone with an HD camera and a copy of Octopus would be willing to capture the footage. I’ll be sure to include your name in the special thanks section of the credits if so!</p> <p>I’ll be posting updates about the film over the next few months on <a href="/r/nintendo">r/nintendo</a> and <a href="/r/gameandwatch">r/gameandwatch</a> for anyone interested in seeing the final product :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b
