<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching Sabine Hossenfelder&#39;s latest video on the possibility that the universe can think. It was really fun. Way out there. Possible ways that the universe might be able to think across infinite distances. I learned real science and math about wormholes while she explored an untestable wacky idea. It scratched an itch that sci-fi scratches, but was more about science than it was about fictional stories.</p> <p>So what book should I read if I want to learn a LOT but also do it while I think about the possibilities of a Creator, Yin and Yang in biology, possible configurations of alien life, or quantum consciousness? Honestly I don&#39;t even really know what I&#39;m looking for.

As you can imagine I&#39;m very isolated, my friends have left me too, and I&#39;m more depressed!

I want to see her improve <em>slowly and painfully</em> over time—no prodigy or chosen-one tropes where she’s suddenly better than warriors who’ve trained their whole lives.
