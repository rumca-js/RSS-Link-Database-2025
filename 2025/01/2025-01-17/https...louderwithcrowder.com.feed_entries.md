## Watch: Bernie Sanders tries playing the "oligarchy" card with Trump's Treasury Secretary, gets hit with a reality check

And while they all supported policies that created some of the worst inflation in modern American history, they could not even pretend to care how much they destroyed the middle class. </p><p>So not only is it disingenuous when people like Bernie Sanders pretend to despise the rich, especially considering he got rich only after a career in government, but he actually only hates rich people when they don’t bow down to his political party. </p><p>Bernie Sanders asked Scott Bessent several times if he believed Biden’s warning that an Oligarchy was forming. To say Sanders is probably the biggest hypocrite to ever work on this earth would be an understatement.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitte
