I still haven&#39;t gotten around to the James Bond and John Wick films though.</p> <p>But oh man, the Mission: Impossible movies might be some of the best action movies of all-time. The first one may be the slow one out of the whole series but even 2 isn&#39;t a bad movie in general despite being the worst of the Mission: Impossible movies. Fallout even blows most of the Marvel movies out of the water besides for Captain America: The Winter Solider and Spider-Man: No Way Home. It&#39;s surprising to me that Tom Cruise does his own stunts for all of the Mission: Impossible movies, if someone like Brad Pitt or Bruce Willis were Ethan Hunt, they wouldn&#39;t do most of their own stunts. And the most divisive movie of the series, Dead Reckoning is still actually a really good movie besides for IIsa&#
