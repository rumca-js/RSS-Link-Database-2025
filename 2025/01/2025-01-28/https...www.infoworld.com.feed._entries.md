<p>Software supply chain security vendor Endor Labs has added another dimension to its products with Tuesday’s launch of AI Model Discovery, which will be part of its core open-source evaluation offering.</p>



<p>AI Model Discovery lets application security professionals discover the local open-source AI models being used in their application code, evaluate their risks, and then create and enforce policies around their usage. It also offers automated detection, warning developers about policy violations and blocking high-risk models from entering production.</p>



<p>“As companies try to develop their internal AI applications, they’re looking for ways to reduce costs, and using a pre-trained mo

<p>While <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> are useful for chatbots, Q&A systems, translation, and other language tasks, their real power emerges when they can act on insights, automating a broader range of problems. In other words, we unlock their greatest potential when we tap their reasoning capabilities.</p>



<p>Reasoning agents have a long history in artificial intelligence research—they refer to a piece of software that can generalize what it has previously seen to apply in situations it hasn’t seen before. It’s like having a decision-making robot that can adapt based on what’s happening

<p>The AI gold rush is creating an unexpected problem: massive waste in resource provisioning. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3486837/how-to-bring-runaway-cloud-costs-under-control.html">Cloud cost overruns</a> inevitably lead to a lack of true ROI for these systems. Many enterprises spend $2 to get $1 of benefits. That dog won’t hunt.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/only-13-of-provisioned-cpus-and-20-of-memory-utilized-in-cloud-computing-report/">Recent data shows a staggering reality</a> of organizations hemorrhaging money through overprovisioned cloud resources, with only 13% of provisioned CPUs and 20% of memory being utilized.</p>
