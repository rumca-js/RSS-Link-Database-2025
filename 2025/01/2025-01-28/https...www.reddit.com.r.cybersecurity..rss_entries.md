It’s one of those things that sounds simple on paper but gets complicated fast when you’re trying to figure out what needs attention first during vulnerability assessments. We’ve got a pretty solid process in place, but I know there’s always room to improve. I’m curious how do you approach this?

My analytics were skewed, and it forced me to quickly implement mitigation strategies.</p> <p>I used Cloudflare’s free and pro tools.. the managed challenge and rate-limiting rules helped mitigate most of the damage. And I identified suspicious referrers.. the bots were targeting old domains I own, indicating this was a targeted attack.</p> <p>I’m curious if anyone has insights into:</p> <p>1. Who might execute this kind of attack on a micro business? My business is literally TINY. I barely break even each month! Yes, there are competitors, but they are MUCH bigger.. for example, I have 135 followers on IG, they have 100k+, and I don&#39;t have enemies that I know of in day to day life. Is there any way I could find out who is behind this?</p> <p>2. Additional steps I can take to protect my shop.</p> <p>I
