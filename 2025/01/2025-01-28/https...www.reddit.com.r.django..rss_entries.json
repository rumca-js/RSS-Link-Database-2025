It&#39;s been a fun project so far, and I&#39;ve made a few updates:</p> <ol> <li><strong>User-friendly interface</strong>: I focused on creating a more intuitive experience to keep users engaged.</li> <li><strong>Dismissible messages</strong>: Users are now better informed about their post progress with helpful notifications.</li> <li><strong>Robust error handling</strong>: Errors are now handled gracefully, preventing any app crashes.</li> <li><strong>Data persistence</strong>: Users won\u2019t have to re-enter data when they encounter an error \u2014 it&#39;s saved for them!</li> </ol> <p>This project has been a great opportunity to focus more on <strong>UI/UX</strong> instead of my usual backend-heavy approach, and I\u2019ve learned a lot in the process.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/keith244/Exp",
