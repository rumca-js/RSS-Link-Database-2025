Every time I see people getting excited about AI, they often talk about use cases like marketing, content creation, building apps or SaaS products, or of course automating tasks like answering emails. Sure, those ideas are all very practical right now, but aren&#39;t they kind of... short-lived?</p> <p>Why would I want to read an article created by an AI when I can just have my own AI create an article that&#39;s personalized with exactly what I need? Or why read an AI-generated email when AI can summarize it, reply to it, or handle it entirely for me?</p> <p>And this same logic applies to many apps and SaaS products: why use a weather app when the forecast is a (voice) prompt and API call away? This may be a simple example, but I feel like most (SaaS) apps can (eventually) be replaced by a LLM chat front-end or agent and an API that connects to some back-end/databa",

For example, some people were criticizing GPT for its poor performance in coding. Then a new model came along and they were super disappointed with image generation. But the reasoning part has been improving super rapidly. As a user, why not focus on the strongest ability the AI has? For example, recently we saw a leap in reasoning, pondering long prompts and providing a logical, structured answer. This part alone could theoretically be used to enhance 99% of the lives of billions of people (for example to optimize schedule, studying techniques, workflow, creative engineering, data analysis and problem solving). So what if they are gathering my personal data and censoring sensitive political content?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonbarvas\"> /u/Jonbarvas </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",
