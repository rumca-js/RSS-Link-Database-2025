It\u2019s actually insane\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile the first book in the series is either genuinely mediocre or just bad. </p> <p>This goes for longer books too.

But I don\u2019t think most people complain because a book is character driven. They complain because nothing happens until the 3rd of 4th book of the series. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to read sun eater. The series is hyped up so much everywhere I see. So I decided to level my expectations and went into the first book without expecting anything. My expectations were perfect",

In the letter Aaric gives her it says something about how the priestess hopes Violet doesn&#39;t have to use the stone so she doesn&#39;t anger another that curries her favor and her path is not yet set. This makes me think there&#39;s another God Violet is attached to. I feel like it could be Loial (definietely a love vs. war theme when it comes to Violet), Hedotis (knowledge from her dad, war from her mom) or Amari (because she is kind of a mixture of all but then not sure she would need Dunne).</p> <p>2) Who do you think the new brother is at the end?

I expected as much going in, and I soon grew attached to our main trio- a brutal knight who lost any hope for humanity, regretfully pulled along on a weird quest to a dying Paris; a priest whose love of wine is only beaten by the weight of his regrets; and finally, an orphan girl.
