<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Very rarely is a game entirely worthy of praise. The metroidvania genre is packed full of good games and i believe that Nine Sols deserves its place among the greats.</p> <p>I implore you to try it out if you enjoy challenging games like sekiro or hollow knight. It does not disappoint. </p> <p>I wanna see this game get the praise it deserves.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vladsamir"> /u/Vladsamir </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ibvmub/i_just_beat_nine_sols_more_people_need_to_play/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ibvmub/i_just_beat_nine_sols_more_people_need_to_play/">[comments]</a></span>

## I miss console price drops

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You know, I saw posts about Xbox Series console sales in the US and I said, &quot;maybe they dropped the price&quot;, but no, it&#39;s still $500 most places for the Xbox Series X. It made me miss previous gens when consoles actually dropped in price and I don&#39;t mean a bit here and there for a quick sale. We&#39;re almost 5 years into this gen and no substantial price drop. I bought most consoles a few years in, sometimes at half the price of what they launched at. This gen has actually seen price increases in some parts of the world. Yes, I know there are multiple factors at play, but disappointing, nevertheless. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SaveADay89"> /u/SaveADay89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ibrxbb/i_miss_console_price_drops/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ibrxbb/i_miss_console_price_drops/">[c
