Don&#39;t read this if you&#39;re wanting to watch it and haven&#39;t yet.</p> <p>I was just watching The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Can someone recommend a book similar to some themes in that movie? I love how Coriolanus loves Lucy Gray. I want a book where the guy meets a girl, and they get separated. Then the guy leaves behind his previous life to chase after the girl, even thought it&#39;s dangerous. Bonus points if the guy protects the girl in fights and dangerous situations. And extra bonus points if it&#39;s a grumpy x sunshine trope. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cass195\"> /u/Cass195 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1icd84c/books_like_coriolanus_snow_and_lucy_gray_bairds/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1icd84c/book",

This time, I decided to give it another shot and picked up <em>Atomic Habits</em> by James Clear (it&#39;s been sitting on my shelf forever).

Ideally, something easy to read so I can actually finish it and get that sense of accomplishment.
