Calling off the JV talks deals a blow to the German firm's China ambitions, after Beijing introduced a new framework under which BlackRock and Goldman Sachs partnered with large Chinese banks to meet Chinese investors' growing needs.",

Liang had kept an extremely low profile until Jan. 20, when he was one of nine individuals asked to give a speech at a closed-door symposium hosted by China's Premier Li Qiang.  But the fact Liang was invited to share his opinions on Chinese government policy highlights Beijing's recognition of DeepSeek's role in potentially upending the global AI order, in China's favour.",

The owner of brands including Louis Vuitton handbags and Bulgari jewellery said sales for the three months to end-December reached 23.9 billion euros ($24.95 billion), as its main fashion and leather division almost matched last year's numbers and sales jumped at its retail unit.  The growth outpaced an expected 1.6% decline, according to a consensus forecast cited by Morgan Stanley.",
