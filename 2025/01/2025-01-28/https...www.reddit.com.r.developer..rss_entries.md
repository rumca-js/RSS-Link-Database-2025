<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi ! I just created a b2b software called Dottron, its a software that allows users to find company domains via just the name of the company. They can upload spreadsheets and get the results within seconds; we have a public api but im unsure of who my target audience would be. Would this do better more tailored to salespeople and adding more custom lookup values like a salesforce or would this be more helpful to developers?</p> <p>DM for website info!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jadenbro1"> /u/Jadenbro1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ibv9b1/b2b_product_but_unknown_audience/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ibv9b1/b2b_product_but_unknown_audience/">[comments]</a></span>
