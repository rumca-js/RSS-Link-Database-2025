C++ Under the Hood: Internal Class Mechanisms - Chris Ryan - CppCon 2024
---

My talk will examine the internal C++ mechanisms around the topics of:
- The C++ onion as it relates to construction, destruction and polymorphism,
- Order of Object construction & destruction, and pre- & post-main() processing.

- Member Data Pointers (not raw pointers) (data-morphic functionality),
- Understanding the Call Stack, Stack Frames and Base Pointer mechanisms.
