I have learned some basics requiring to understand it. solved labs Portswigger, try hack me and gained some foundation knowledge specially in IDOR, XXE, SQLI, C, SSRF etc.. And yeah by learning this I Also able to find this vulnerabilities. but in random sites not actually in any bbp or vdp.. well here my question starts </p> <p>unlike in labs or while you learning in somewhere in Portswigger labs those labs are too basic.. I hardly find to use them in real world scenarios.. am currently self learning all of this. any free sources you recommend for advancing those skills? Currently I am focusing on advance IDOR.
