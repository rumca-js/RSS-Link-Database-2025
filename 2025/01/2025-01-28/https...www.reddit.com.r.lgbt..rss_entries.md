Probably into the mid-80s. When I came out though I really did it, all the way out. I was active in college and very visible. I&#39;d wear gay t-shirts and stuff. That was being very visible, like it was a thing. </p> <p>This was all during the AIDS crisis too, and it occurred to me a few years ago, like 2015 or so, how far, far in history that period was. The ferocity of homophobia remains difficult to comprehend. And I wonder, because I saw a lot of it, if I downplay it and think it wasn&#39;t as bad as it was. Lol it was. Lots of people had it worse than I did though. </p> <p>But here we are, and it&#39;s going to get bad for a while again. Wish it wasn&#39;t.

Like many of you, the news and social media has been terrifying for me since the election and worse since the inauguration. However, during this time, I have also found a boyfriend (21m) who I can&#39;t stop thinking about, and who has become a sounding board to help me calm myself down. I have known I was gay since I was 13 or 14, but this is the first time I&#39;ve felt what I believe could be a genuine love for someone else. I wanted to share this because, contrary to what they want us to believe, these feelings are never wrong. And just because one orange mother fucker sits in the white house, does not mean that we cannot find love anymore. I have found so much power in the simple act of holding his hand in a mall, or kissing him where others can see. I do not mean that the only way to fight is to

She&#39;s a bigot and seems to be very confused about the space she occupies in the world. She votes against all of our interests and thinks her wealth will protect her from the fallout. Her president doesn&#39;t even recognize her right to exist. And I&#39;m wrong because I don&#39;t support her??
