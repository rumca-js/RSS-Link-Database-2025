        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Hollywood celebrities are openly weeping over Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, Trump is more popular than he\u2019s ever been in his political career. That tells you everything you need to know. Also, Trump again floats the possibility of abolishing the income tax. I\u2019ll explain why that would instantly make him at least the second greatest president in US history. And New York Magazine tries to slander young right-wing Trump supporters, but instead accidentally makes them seem cool as hell. And, in our Daily Cancelation, I\u2019m afraid I must cancel a certain prominent Republican congresswoman. She has left me no choice.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:30 Opening\n02:09 - 15:40 Selena Gomez Should Deport Herself In Solidarity With 'Her People'\n16:38 - 30:54 Trump Discusses Reinstating Penal Colonies And Adding More Tariffs\n30:55 - 34:18 Gen Z Is More Religious Than Their Millennial Counterparts\n34:19 - 42:02 NY Magazine Cover Paints Right-Wingers As Successful",
