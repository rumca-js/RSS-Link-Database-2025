<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently aiming to get into the modding scenario of GTA:SA as it&#39;s one of my favourite game and to nobody&#39;s surprise:- it&#39;s an extremely moddable game.</p> <p>However i have learnt that to begin with the mods I&#39;d need to have the v1.0 (US) release of the pc, and on the internet almost all the cracked versions are anything but above the 1.0 as needed. There is although, a downgrading tool available on GTA Forums but apparently it doesn&#39;t works well with a pirated copy of the game.</p> <p>So I&#39;m wondering whereas it&#39;s actually true or not? If so, can i still somehow help myself to possibly downgrade the necessary version?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gimme_da_gulabi"> /u/Gimme_da_gulabi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1ic8axr/does_the_gtasa_downgrader_works_on_a_cracked/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://

However, when I check the apps in the settings, both games show as 152GB.

I tried updating my graphics drivers (GTX 1060 - I know my odds are slim w/ this thing), but even after a restart the message persists.</p> <p>Did my installation go wrong somehow? (All hashes checked out post-install.) Or is my GPU simply too outdated?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/charcoal_wings"> /u/charcoal_wings </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSup
