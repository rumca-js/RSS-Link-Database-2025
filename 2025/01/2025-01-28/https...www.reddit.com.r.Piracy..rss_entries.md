<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is just an appreciation post! :) </p> <p>To whoever created the Megathread... I love you &lt;3 It has links to literally everything! </p> <p>This sub is so fascinating because I used to be a pirate in the early 00s, but these days I mainly watch things on OTT platforms and buy my games. However, streaming is getting ridiculous... too many streaming channels and content keeps jumping from one platform to another. Sometimes, I want to watch a particular film but don&#39;t want to pay for a new subscription! So sailing it is then! ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blubber-Trouble"> /u/Blubber-Trouble </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ibsas1/read_the_megathread_3/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ibsas1/read_the_megathread_3/">[comments]</a></span>
