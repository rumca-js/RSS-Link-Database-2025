There is a monastery located high in the mountains of Europe. Grisly secrets lurk within its fortified walls: inhabitants afflicted by strange diseases; bodies dropped from towers, chickens pecking at the bits of splattered brain. Scariest of all? The sheer hypocrisy of those who profess love to God and their fellow humans yet never miss an opportunity to subjugate - with words, cane, or an object much sharper - those more vulnerable than themselves.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-stone-of-madness-review">Read more</a></p>

It's a collection of testimony from players and designers and it covers all kinds of fascinating things. I remember - I have to remember this; I have no idea where I left the book - that it starts with a bit about Tomb Raider. Someone's playing the first game in the series in front of an audience and mentions that the controls are really "fluid". Someone else in the audience then asks what "fluid" means, and...and nobody can pin it down at all.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ninja-gaiden-2-black-dropped-on-xbox-game-pass-and-now-i-can-hear-bird-song-again">Read more</a></p>
