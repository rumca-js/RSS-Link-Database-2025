For example, this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGIC-Gaming-Computers-Desktop-Computer/dp/B0DHCVL9HT/\">Acemagic AM08 Pro is down to $399 on Amazon</a>, making it way more affordable than its original $499.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mini PC runs on an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU and 32GB of DDR5 RAM, which is pretty spectacular for a productivity machine. Laptops with similar configurations can cost upwards of $1,000, and even more if it comes with a dedicated graphics card. The AM08 Pro doesn\u2019t have a dedicated GPU, but it does come with integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics that\u2019ll serve well enough for moderate gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also comes with a 512GB SSD on board, enough space for all but the largest apps, games, photos, and videos you might need to store.
