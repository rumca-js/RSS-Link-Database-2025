Adil Rashid was masterful in Rajkot, the leg-spinner delivering the key wicket of Tilak Varma, conceding no boundaries and securing his side’s first victory of this tour. India failed to chase down 172, their series lead now standing at 2-1 with two T20 internationals still to play.</p><p>Rashid’s spell of one for 15 was vital after an English implosion with the bat. Ben Duckett had excelled early on, striking 51 off 28, before Varun Chakravarthy played chief nemesis with figures of five for 24.

It’s been a horrifying year for too many in California, land and lives lost, the unimaginable process of figuring out what comes next now on the horizon.

<p>Rod Wooden’s play about poverty in Newcastle broached the class divide with disconcerting realism</p><p>I was a middle-class kid growing up in a very working-class city, Newcastle. It was a great place for theatre, with the Playhouse and Live theatre.

But if the RSC productions I saw were a scented candle, Rod Wooden’s play Your Home in the West was semtex.</p><p>I saw it at Live theatre in the early 1990s. I was very aware of the social and political tensions of that era. My parents – both very leftwing – had taken me on marches as a kid to support the miners.

It’s a thing of pure joy, with crunchy textures, fresh flavours and the right amount of punch. Play around with the balance, adding more acidity, sweetness or spice to suit your palate.
