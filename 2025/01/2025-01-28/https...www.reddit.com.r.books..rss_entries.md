<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not too long ago, I chanced upon a copy of Michael Shaara’s ‘The Killer Angels’ at my library, and since I was in the mood for some classic war literature, thought I’d give it a go. And, honestly, it absolute floored me. </p> <p>Now, I’ve always been something of a history buff, but my knowledge of America before the 1900s was rather limited, in comparison, so I only had my preconceived notions about what to expect. What I didn’t expect was a deconstruction of the psychology of the key players at the Battle of Gettysburg, and an examination of the ideological elements that underpinned each soldier’s actions and choices during the war. </p> <p>One would expect that war is multifaceted, but I thought that, Shaara’s depiction of the Southern soldiers and leaders, in particular, sheds more light on the Confederacy in a way that I just hadn’t experienced before. Lee’s decision to stand by Virginia, the toll it exacted on his soul and the way he clung to t

Usually I don&#39;t like supernatural horror, Exorcist being the only exception. For a non horror reader like me, the real horror was seeing the transformation of Guy, the husband. I haven&#39;t read that many books with such a startling character transformation. It was his malice that grew and made me suffocate. The transformation from a seeming loving husband to a conniving heartless monster truly shook me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kafkadaddy"> /u/Kafkadaddy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ic3gxi/rosemarys_baby_was_surprisingly_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ic3gxi/rosemarys_baby_was_surprisingly_good/">[comments]</a></span>

Both stories features epigraphs before each chapter that are citations from books written by characters in the book. It&#39;s a really fascinating bit of world-building because I find that after a while I kind of forget that the books aren&#39;t real. I find myself wanting to read these other, &quot;fake&quot; books too. Have you come across this technique in your reading? Can you think of other fiction that regularly cites books that aren&#39;t real? <em>House of Leaves</em> comes to mind, but I&#39;m sure there are others. For example, here&#39;s a bit from Nayler&#39;s book.</p> <blockquote> <p>The octopus is the &quot;tribleless, la

The concept is simple—one man quietly observing different people’s lives—but it makes you think. It follows a teenager dealing with personal struggles, a businessperson hiding insecurities, and a shopkeeper balancing dreams and duty.</p> <p>Even though it’s short, it does a good job of capturing those small but meaningful moments in life. The writing felt calm and reflective, which I liked.</p> <p>Overall, it was a nice read. Has anyone else checked it out?

I will say, damn this fucker can write. </p> <p>Taking place in a hellish France during the middle of the Black Death, you wouldn’t be surprised when I told you this book was bleak. I expected as much going in, and I soon grew attached to our main trio- a brutal knight who lost any hope for humanity, regretfully pulled along on a weird quest to a dying Paris; a priest whose love of wine is only beaten by the weight of his regrets; and finally, an orphan girl. The girl winds up being pretty important. </p> <p>The parts of the book that really worked for me, other than our three mains, were the horror elements. These elements weren’t very “boo!” More like “oh Jesus Christ we’re ants before the grand scheme of heaven, and lucky to be considered even a plaything to devils” (I am not religious and these are the thoughts this fucking book put in me). </p> <p>I just wish the book read less episodic.
