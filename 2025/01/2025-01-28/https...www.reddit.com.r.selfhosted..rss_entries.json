I have no need for chat or any other functionality, just streaming video content and games. </p> <p>Does anything like this exist ? </p> <p>thanks ! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Draglid\"> /u/Draglid </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1iborev/discord_4k_streaming_alternative_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1iborev/discord_4k_streaming_alternative_recommendations/\">[comments]</",
