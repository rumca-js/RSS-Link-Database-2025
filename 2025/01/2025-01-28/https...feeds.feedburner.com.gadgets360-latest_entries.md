Asteroid 2024 PT5, sized like a school bus, passed Earth in January at 1.1 million miles. Research suggests it originated from the moon, ejected thousands of years ago by an impact. Spectral analysis matched it to Apollo 14 lunar rocks, ruling out artificial origins. This is the second known lunar asteroid after 469219 Kamo’oalewa. The study hints at more lunar-origin asteroids awaiting discovery, enhancing planetary defense strategies and asteroid tracking capabilities. Upcoming technologies, like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, promise to improve detection efforts.

Extended space missions, such as those aboard the International Space Station (ISS), are linked to significant ocular changes in astronauts. These changes, collectively termed spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), affect around 70 percent of astronauts. A recent study found reductions in ocular rigidity, intraocular pressure, and ocular pulse amplitude, raising concerns for long-term eye health. Experts warn that these changes could persist on missions to Mars, making additional studies and preventive measures critical for future space exploration.

For the first time, plasma jets from a supermassive black hole have been observed in real time. Located 270 million light-years away in galaxy 1ES 1927+654, the jets traveled at one-third the speed of light. Emerging in 2024 after a radio flare in 2023, the jets broke through dense gas near the black hole, which has a mass 1.4 billion times that of the Sun. This discovery refines black hole activity models and offers insight into the role of magnetic forces in high-speed jet creation.

Chorus waves, energetic electromagnetic bursts resembling bird chirps, have been detected 100,000 miles from Earth, far beyond their usual range. NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites observed these waves in a flatter region of Earth's magnetosphere, contradicting prior assumptions about their formation near strong magnetic gradients. The waves, driven by solar plasma instability, accelerate particles to near-light speeds, endangering spacecraft and astronauts. This discovery, published in Nature, highlights the need for advanced solar plasma monitoring to safeguard future space missions and refine our understanding of Earth's magnetosphere.

Boson stars, invisible celestial objects theorised to form from axions, are now at the centre of dark matter research. Axions, light and wave-like bosons, may cluster under gravity, forming these mysterious entities. Unlike normal stars, boson stars neither emit light nor interact with regular matter in observable ways. With sizes ranging from small stellar masses to entire galactic cores, their indirect effects, such as disrupting nuclear fusion, are under investigation. If confirmed, boson stars could reshape our understanding of the universe.
