Fallout even blows most of the Marvel movies out of the water besides for Captain America: The Winter Solider and Spider-Man: No Way Home. It&#39;s surprising to me that Tom Cruise does his own stunts for all of the Mission: Impossible movies, if someone like Brad Pitt or Bruce Willis were Ethan Hunt, they wouldn&#39;t do most of their own stunts.
