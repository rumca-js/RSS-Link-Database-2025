Is Yoshino REALLY a Solid State Battery? Head over to http://eightsleep.com/mattferrell and use the code MATT to get $350 off your very own Pod 4 Ultra. After my previous video on Yoshino’s solid state battery, I followed up on reports that claimed it may not be “solid state.” I’ve had multiple conversations with TechInsights, the company that broke down Yoshino’s solid state cell, as well as my friend @Ziroth, who organized a breakdown in a university lab. The burning question now becomes: “Is Yoshino’s battery actually solid state?” And if it’s not, why is the company calling it that in the first place?
