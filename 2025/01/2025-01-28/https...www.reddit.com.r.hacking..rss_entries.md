<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey there people, I am currently into this pentestring field.. I have learned some basics requiring to understand it. solved labs Portswigger, try hack me and gained some foundation knowledge specially in IDOR, XXE, SQLI, C, SSRF etc.. And yeah by learning this I Also able to find this vulnerabilities. but in random sites not actually in any bbp or vdp.. well here my question starts </p> <p>unlike in labs or while you learning in somewhere in Portswigger labs those labs are too basic.. I hardly find to use them in real world scenarios.. am currently self learning all of this. any free sources you recommend for advancing those skills? Currently I am focusing on advance IDOR. Focusing on this particular vulnerability.. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoProcedure7943"> /u/NoProcedure7943 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibxh91/advanced_learning/">[link]</a></span

Forgive any ignorance I just love this and am eager to learn</p> <p>In my home lab I wanted to try and create a reverse tcp payload using venom for an older android tablet i had (A8). I created several payload using both shikata ga nai (interesting tid bit in japanese this means &quot;it cant be helped&quot; or &quot;to endure what you cant control&quot;), base64, nothing and tried a few other encoders, the name of which escapes me at the moment. </p> <p>I created a msf reverse handler and served it from a python simple http server on my local network. All ports and listener set up was correct. The tablet had google AV turned off for this exercise. I downloaded each payload to the device and when i attempted to install, only the non encoded payload would install, im assuming because of bad characters. The non encod

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve taken the eJPT cert and currently working on the PNPT. The learning sources for both and THM do a thorough focus on how to do stuff, but they don&#39;t really go into the mindset on how to approach a problem and what to look for. </p> <p>For instance, a good amount of the PNPT (especially the web portion) just says &quot;okay do this and then do that&quot;. It just shows you how to do a very specific thing. I&#39;m trying to work on my methodologies and how to approach something. But it&#39;s hard finding content like this. </p> <p>Any suggestions or sources that explain stuff a bit more thoroughly? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/error_therror"> /u/error_therror </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibs93t/where_to_learn_methodologies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ibs93t/where_to_learn_methodologies/">
