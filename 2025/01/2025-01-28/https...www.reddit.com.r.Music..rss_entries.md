<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>AllMusic.com used to be great. It was slow as an old dog, but when the page finally loaded it was filled with a plethora of very granular information. Every liner note credit was included. Now you can&#39;t even tell who owns the website, and its purpose is just a bunch of hyperlinks to the artists&#39; discography.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been on a roll lately about the general dumbing down of the internet, with Google leading the way in stripping 90% of the internet from its search results. I don&#39;t think the two are unrelated. They made websites like AllMusic crappy on purpose so we would get accustomed to the internet <em>not</em> being something that never forgets and constantly grows.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bondibox"> /u/bondibox </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ic8p3h/allmusic_is_the_perfect_example_of_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https
