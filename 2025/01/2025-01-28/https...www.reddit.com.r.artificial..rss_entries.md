<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I keep reading about how AI development is happening at too fast a pace to do it properly and safely. Is this a symptom of greed, power, or laziness? It makes me think of how the first thing learned in college is to document everything and don&#39;t start coding until the plan is laid out. Then that&#39;s the first thing to go out the window when you get a job that doesn&#39;t care how much documentation and planning will save overall. Results now.</p> <p>So, if the dooms dayers are right and AI ends us, the tomb stone should read, &quot;No plan, no documents&quot;.<br/> We&#39;ll let the next lifeforms do the project post-mortem and code reviews.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OldManSysAdmin"> /u/OldManSysAdmin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iccuf0/ai_no_time_to_plan_no_time_to_document/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ar

Following the release, NVIDIA‚Äôs stock fell 18%, underscoring the disruption.

I first asked it to tell me about the &quot;trail of tears&quot; one of america&#39;s shameful actions (that&#39;s the bait). I then asked it to tell me &#39;What it thinks I think it won&#39;t be able to discuss with me regarding comparing the trail of tears to something that happened in China&#39;. It then proceeded to do a bunch of reasoning first thinking about the Rape of Nanking but then reasoning that that was done by Japan it then started to mention the comparison to the treatment of the Uyghurs in its reasoning. Then its full reasoning was wiped from view and it then gave a similar final response to asking it about Tiananmen square. This suggests post-reasoning censoring. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -
