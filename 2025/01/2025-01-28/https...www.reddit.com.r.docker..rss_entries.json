While I have managed to create the network and connect to it, the host is still accessible over ssh/port 22.</p> <p>Overall, I&#39;d love to have port-forwarded traffic go to an adapter that can talk to _only_ a single docker container that will be responsible for some security screening and reverse-proxys/redirects.</p> <p>Really, any security advice would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bilateral_melon\"> /u/bilateral_melon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1ibwtzo/isolate_ethernet_for_containers_and_wifi_for_host/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1ibwtzo/isolate_ethernet_for_conta",
