## Deep Madness: hardcore underwater horror survival

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>At first glance Deep Madness looks like Lovecraftian underwater Zombicide: a lot of monsters, a lot of dice rolling, too. However here you cannot just smash hordes of zombies, you have to survive and run away. Coupled with grim artstyle, creepy monsters and plot it creates a great horror atmosphere. </p> <p>While combat is dice rolling, you can mitigate random by spending sanity tokens. However this will eventually lead to getting madness tokens, and if you grow too mad, there will be nasty consequences... A nice dilemma.</p> <p>Oxygen is another cool and thematic mechanics. If you spend all oxygen while in water, you have to get to surface or start slowly dying...</p> <p>All things above together with game becoming harder over time (monsters grow in numbers, rooms get devoured - become monster spawns or do bad things to you, madness increases) turns Deep Madness into more a efficiency puzzle rather than standard dungeon crawler.</p> <p>Unfortunately

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!<br/> So, i &quot;decided&quot; to go with Mage Knight for my Solo Game, because i can get it now, instead of waiting for the other solo games, and that it has a hard difficulty wich is what i like, but before making the purcharse i would like to know the answer for this questions:<br/> - Are the fan made campaigns really good? Because i was going to to get Gloomhaven: Jaws because it had a campaign, but on BBG i saw that the fans created campaigns for Mage Knight</p> <p>- How are games 2 hours + long? From what i saw from explanations/reviews, the player have to move and kill mobs, how does that take so long? Based on the options and cards that i saw. Or the monsters have a lot of HP and it takes 10+ turns for each mob, or i am not seeing it how can it be so long</p> <p>- Are the maps random? When exploring, how to see what map piece should appear?</p> <p>- For a person that loves campaign or line of sessions to follow, will &quot;i enjoy&quot

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I’m very curious to see how many people sleeve their cards in board games, or how many people wish they could sleeve them, but cannot find the proper size. Does everyone prefer standard size cards? Does it depend on the game? I feel about 5-10% of avid board gamers sleeve cards from board games. Or maybe they only sleeve their favorite board game. One thing that’s nice about sleeves is that cards won’t get damaged, and it keeps all cards mint condition. (Players can’t memorize the best card has a bent corner) thank you for any feedback on the topic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Summoner0414"> /u/Summoner0414 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1icbjn5/card_sleeves_in_board_games_and_card_size/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1icbjn5/card_sleeves_in_board_games_and_card_size/">[comments]</a><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, as the title suggests: I started Boardgameing with Axis and Allies really like Dudes on a map game. Since then I was always looking for a modern, nice and crisp rework of this kind of games. I own Runewars, Forbidden Stars, Root, TI4 and some others but these games have one thing, that prevents them to make them the chosen one (i e.: Hereos and the combat cards in Runewars; Combat cards and movement in FS, Boring Combats in Root and no different types of units, TI4 being too long and less about war than scoring objectives). So when I saw Star Wars Rebellion and Dune War for Arrakis, I thought these or on of them could maybe finally the chosen one. But I read, that Rebellion is rather a cat-and-mouse-game than a wargame and Dune is more about action economy and fulfilling missions (atleast for Atreides). So my Question/hope: Am I wrong? Could one of them be, what I am looking for?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr

However, it has also sparked a friendly debate over the nature of the game. Namely, for some people, it seems to be that Sauron wins the majority of the games. </p> <p>There are two opposing sides to this argument: </p> <p>One side claims this is a symmetric game, therefore it would be wrong to count wins by &quot;faction&quot; (such as Sauron), as there is no difference between Sauron and the FP, thus saying Sauron is stronger or has a better winrate is erroneous. </p> <p>The other side claims that the Sauron player <em>is</em> stronger, there are sides and Sauron has a higher winrate (which basically would render it an asymmetric game of sorts). </p> <p>To me personally, it seems that the only difference is the fact that Sauron is the starting player. However, this is balanced by the FPs extra coin. </p> <p>Any good insights here on how to settle

They slid in pretty well, but about 85% of the way through sleeving it I noticed some of the cards had a very, very slight bow to them - under 1mm between the card and the sleeve at the most bowed point. Pressing down on the deck flattens everything nicely while you have it under pressure, but if you just set the deck down (talking 25-40 card decks here) everything rises up slightly due to the bow. I ran into this same issue a little while ago with Hero Realms, and out of curiousity I made some paper bands that were the same height as the cards, so that they would keep the entire deck pressed together evenly. Keeping the cards pressed together seemed to resolve the issue for the few days that I had them like that - I&#39;d take them out and the decks would basically sit flat, or rise just a tiny bit (though I later resleeved them ent

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, a friend of mine recently gifted me a custom deck with cards numbered 0 to 20 in 6 different suits. I&#39;d love suggestions on what are the best games we can play, as the only one I&#39;m familiar with is Schotten Totten/Battleline.</p> <p>Also, I&#39;d really appreciate some inputs on how to resize the rules (without needing to rewrite them from scratch) to fit in the box.</p> <p>Thanks, guys!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ScarletAccount"> /u/ScarletAccount </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ibs2qx/best_games_to_play_with_this_custom_deck/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ibs2qx/best_games_to_play_with_this_custom_deck/">[comments]</a></span>

Just a single race against five legends with the rain weather tile, five road conditions, and three car upgrades. My draw was damn near perfect all game with stress cards giving me the exact amount needed, some of the upgrades giving me some leeway with 3-4 cooldown at pivotal moments, and some of the best heat management I’ve had in a while. </p> <p>I just wanted to share this as it’s probably the biggest lead/win I’ve ever had playing against the legends. </p> <p>Cheers and happy gaming! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

I don&#39;t have the Russian Star Wars Fluxx or Polish Rick &amp; Morty Fluxx.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made a mistake and bought a 3000 piece jigsaw puzzle. It&#39;s like 3.5&#39;x4&#39;. I have nowhere to build it. I have a regular size foldable card table but it&#39;s only 3&#39;x3&#39;. I searched the internet, but I cannot find a 4&#39;x4&#39; foldable, adjustable height card table. Do they not make these? If they don&#39;t, does anyone have any idea on a good surface that I can build puzzles and play games, that can be stored when not in use?
