<p>You may think you need a new laptop, but you might actually be better off with a mini PC. For example, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGIC-Gaming-Computers-Desktop-Computer/dp/B0DHCVL9HT/">Acemagic AM08 Pro is down to $399 on Amazon</a>, making it way more affordable than its original $499.</p>



<p>This mini PC runs on an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU and 32GB of DDR5 RAM, which is pretty spectacular for a productivity machine. Laptops with similar configurations can cost upwards of $1,000, and even more if it comes with a dedicated graphics card. The AM08 Pro doesn’t have a dedicated GPU, but it does come with integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics that’ll serve well enough for moderate gaming.</p>



<p>It also comes with a 512GB SSD on board, enough space for all but the largest apps, games, photos, and videos you might need to store. Should you want

<p>Logitech’s MX series is consistently held up as the best non-gaming mice on the market, and the MX Vertical is no exception. With a thoughtful shape for a more comfortable and natural hand position, not to mention a big dollop of style, it’s easy to see why it tops the charts for ergonomic mice. Normally $100, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT/">Amazon is selling it for $63.89 right now</a>.</p>



<p>The MX Vertical packs many of the same features as the MX Master into a swoopy, chunky mouse with a 57-degree tilt to keep your hand and arm in a more ideal position for extended use.</p>



<p>While the MX Vertical lacks super-fast scrolling, its two thumb buttons and cursor speed switch can be set to custom actions via Logitech Options, and triple-device wireless works over USB or Bluetooth. The batt

<p>The Samsung T9 portable SSD is easily one of our favorite storage options, and it just so happens that you can get the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1844643-REG/samsung_mu_pk2t0g_ww_t9_gray_2tb_capacity.html">2TB version for just $170 at B&H</a>. (Note that while B&H has this listed as originally $220, the MSRP for this is actually $240. You’re saving $70!)</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2079244/samsung-t9-20gbps-usb-ssd-review.html">reviewed the Samsung T9</a>, we gave it a near-perfect 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, appreciating its great performance, textured surface, and extended 5-year warranty. We didn’t like the price at release, but it’s a darn good deal now with this discount.</p>
