Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Hollywood celebrities are openly weeping over Trump’s immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, Trump is more popular than he’s ever been in his political career. That tells you everything you need to know. Also, Trump again floats the possibility of abolishing the income tax. I’ll explain why that would instantly make him at least the second greatest president in US history. And New York Magazine tries to slander young right-wing Trump supporters, but instead accidentally makes them seem cool as hell. And, in our Daily Cancelation, I’m afraid I must cancel a certain prominent Republican congresswoman. She has left me no choice.
