the more prominent open social networks, all of which operate
using different protocols: Mastodon uses ActivityPub, Bluesky runs
on AT Protocol, and Nostr powers a number of third-party apps.
Openvibe later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/01/cross-posting-social-app-openvibe-now-supports-threads-too/">added support for Instagram Threads</a>, as
that app became further integrated with ActivityPub and opened
itself up to the developer community.</p>

app was to offer users a more friendly a

<p>Jim Acosta, signing off from CNN for the final time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant. I believe it is
the job of the press to hold power to account — I’ve always tried
to do that here at CNN, and I plan on doing all of that again in
the future.</p>

<p>One final message: Don’t give in to the lies. Don’t give in to the
fear. Hold on to the truth, and hope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Trump, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113906705175756002">gloating</a> on his very popular social network, Truth Social (current ranking the App Store: not in the top 200 free downloads, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/truth-social-app-store-2025-01-28.png">#20 in Social Networking</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wow, really good news! Jim Acosta, one of the worst and most

  <p>Anyway, this matters because it doesn’t mean that DeepSeek, an app
based off of the Chinese-developed AI model of the same name, is
the most popular app ever despite its current place atop the
charts. Your mom probably isn’t downloading it. Just as last week,
your mom probably wasn’t <a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-042-tiktok-twitter/#:~:text=%2D%2D%20Candacce%2C,in%20social%20media.">downloading Xiaohongshu</a> (‘<a href="https://spyglass.org/dispatch-043-bromo-sapiens/#:~:text=%F0%9F%95%9A%20TikTok%20Prepares,%3F%20%5BInformation%20%F0%9F%94%92%5D">Little
Red Book</a>’), incidentally another Chinese app that rose to
the top of the charts. But it is still interesting because again,
the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure,
new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was
almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp,
