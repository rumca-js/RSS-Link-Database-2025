Fortunately I managed to load the system file with a rescue disk and connect to it via ssh. Now I have around 24M files on Linux with the total size of 30TB that I need to transfer to a windows machine on another esxi. I&#39;ve connected the two machines directly with 10GB network adapters and a fiber cable, so there&#39;s no physical switch between the machines. The datastore of Linux machine is on a NAS lun which is connected to the network with a 1GB Ethernet cable. The datastore of windows is on the logical drive of the same server that esxi is installed on it. The HDD on both machines is WD Red Pro. I first tried to transfer the data from Linux to windows using GoodSync but it always hangs in the middle of analysing. Then used lftp on Linux machines but its speed doesn&#39;t go beyond 3Mb/s.

I am stuck because scaling in both macOS and Linux sucks in a different way and this makes deciding really tough.</p> <p>4k: Looks bad on Linux when scaled 100% or 200 % and fractional scaling is buggy but looks quite nice on macOS.</p> <p>1440p: The ideal monitor for Linux with decent screen size on 100% scaling but this time, macOS scaling hits bad and text looks very blurry on macOS.</p> <p>I wonder is it worth going for 4k despite scaling issues on Linux or get 2k instead which will be good forLinux but problematic for macOS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JailbreakHat\"> /u/JailbreakHat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ic1q71/4k_vs_1440p_dilemma/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",
