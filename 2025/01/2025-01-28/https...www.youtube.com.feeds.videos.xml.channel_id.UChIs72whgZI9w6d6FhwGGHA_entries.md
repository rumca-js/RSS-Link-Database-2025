This benchmark compares PCIe generation differences on the NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. We're testing PCIe 5.0 x16 vs. PCIe 4.0 x16 vs. PCIe 3.0 x16. This also helps serve as an effective PCIe 5.0 x8 vs. PCIe 5.0 x16 benchmark, as PCIe 5.0 x8 is represented by PCIe 4.0 x16. The testing is done on our AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU test bench, enabling the RTX 5090 for PCIe difference testing. Overall, we did not find a significant difference between the PCIe generations 3 through 5 when tested on x16 lanes each.
