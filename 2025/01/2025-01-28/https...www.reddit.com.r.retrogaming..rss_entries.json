I stream using OBS and run the games on the Rosalie&#39;s Mupen GUI emulator.</p> <p>I did some test streams to see how well my computer could run them at the same time I was streaming but when I saw the upload I found that it had these horrible visual glitches. </p> <p>Mostly is that... the right side of the screen stays frozen a few frames behind? I dont&#39; know how to describe it os I will link the vids.</p> <p>The issue is very present on Mario, Starfox, Conker and Smash. Is a bit less strong on Kirby but the cutscenes are just completly broken with half the screen being black. With Zelda and Banjo the issue is less noticeable but those are the more demanding to my PC. </p> <p>So, anyone has any advice? I would greatly apreaciate it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/CNealyMgDz0?si=xYXJCZDp-nFr30Fl\">https://www.youtube.",
