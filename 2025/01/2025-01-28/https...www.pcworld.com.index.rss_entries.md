<p>So many of the symbols and icons we use every day are learned without ever knowing the meanings behind them. We just go about our days, pressing and clicking on buttons, without a second thought — and a lot of them have become unrecognizable to younger generations, like the shape of a phone icon or the history of the save icon.</p>



<p>Well, do you know why power buttons use a symbol that looks like a broken circle with a vertical line down the top? Here’s what the symbol means and where it came from.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-iconic-power-symbol-explained">The iconic power symbol, explained</h2>



<p>The power symbol, which can still be seen on nearly all modern PCs and laptops, originated in the 1950s. At the time, devices were still operated using physical switches that had “on” and “off” states.</p>



<p>But using the words “on” a

<p>You knew it was going to happen: Nvidia executives are already floating the possibility that Nvidia’s new high-end RTX 5000 cards may sell out.</p>



<p>Tim Adams, Nvidia’s global head of the GeForce community, said <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/556319/geforce-rtx-50-series-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a forum post</a> that Nvidia believes that “stock outs” — a situation where retailers sell out of a certain product — may happen.</p>



<p>“We expect significant demand for the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 and believe stock-outs may happen,” he wrote in an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/556319/geforce-rtx-50-series-availability/">Nvidia forum post</a>. “Nvidia & our partners are shipping more stock to retail every day to help get GPUs

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of a million gamers waiting for the release of Nvidia’s next-gen RTX cards with bated breath. You’ll be able to part with your hard-earned cash in a few days, and Newegg and Best Buy are first in line to take it. The retailers already have listings for dozens of RTX 5090 and 5080 cards — and some of them even have prices.</p>



<p>Go ahead and check out the early RTX 50 listings on <a href="https://www.newegg.com/RTX-50-Series/EventSaleStore/ID-1473?N=100006662">Newegg</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&qp=gpusv_facet%3DGraphics%20Processing%20Unit%20(GPU)~Nvidia%20GeForce%20RTX%205080&st=geforce+rtx+5080">Best Buy</a>.

<p>If one smart button is great, two must be phenomenal, right? Well, we’ll need to wait until we can lay hands on one, but Flic is now taking discounted pre-orders on its all-new two-button Flic Duo smart home controller.</p>

Or maybe there’s just nothing you want to watch anymore. Whatever the reason, you might be wondering: Is it time for a Netflix break?</p>



<p>The idea of putting Netflix on pause is more fraught than it is for other streaming services. For many of us, Netflix has been in our lives for decades–heck, I was a Netflix subscriber for nearly 20 years straight–while the other big streamers are barely a few years old.</p>

<p>DeepSeek, the latest alternative to ChatGPT and other AI assistants, recently released a new version that’s causing chaos and confusion across the AI landscape. With reports about DeepSeek’s outstanding performance and power efficiency emerging, established entities like OpenAI and Meta are getting quite nervous.</p>



<p>None more nervous than Nvidia, though, whose market cap plummeted in response to the hype over DeepSeek. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-27/nvidia-loses-589-billion-as-deepseek-batters-stock-evening-briefing-americas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Nvidia lost a record $569 billion at the start of the week.

<p>Taiwan is the world’s biggest producer of high-end computer processors and semiconductors. The newly-minted Trump administration has announced its latest series of tariff plans, including a “25 percent, 50 percent, or even 100 percent tax” on chips produced in Taiwan. If implemented, the price of nearly all electronics imported to the US will skyrocket later in the year. </p>



<p>President Donald Trump has pursued tariffs as an immediate and dramatic means of achieving his political goals, threatening both US allies and rivals with tariffs to force capitulation to his demands. Notably the Trump administration has immediately threatened America’s biggest and most immediate trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China, with tariffs on all imported goods if various conditions are not met. </p>

<p>Instead of integrating Copilot as a function in Windows, Microsoft has presented its AI assistant as a new app. The app seems to automatically install itself onto your machine via the monthly updates, but only if you’re in the US. However, if you’re from the EU, the app is only available on the Microsoft Store. We’ll show you how to manually install it (if you chose to embrace Copilot and its features that is).</p>
