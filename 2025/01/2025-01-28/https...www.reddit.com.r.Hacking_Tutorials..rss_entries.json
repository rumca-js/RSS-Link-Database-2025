You can connect to the internet by accepting the terms and conditions and it&#39;s free. </p> <p>However, I&#39;m trying to connect a ethernet to one of the many repeaters we have, and I want to avoid the green wall. We can&#39;t find the guys info who installed it, it was so many years ago, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s somewhere if we look hard enough, but we want to be able to connect some wifi cameras to the network and bypass the login information. I have access to the modem, router, and everything in the server room where it&#39;s set up. I have some security cameras already wired connected but it&#39;s connected to the Comcast box. What should I look for, or can I be pointed in the right direction. I&#39;m very tech savvy (lol not this time) so if you have a tutorial or program I can use to do this. Please help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",
