        "description": "Is Yoshino REALLY a Solid State Battery? Head over to http://eightsleep.com/mattferrell and use the code MATT to get $350 off your very own Pod 4 Ultra. After my previous video on Yoshino\u2019s solid state battery, I followed up on reports that claimed it may not be \u201csolid state.\u201d I\u2019ve had multiple conversations with TechInsights, the company that broke down Yoshino\u2019s solid state cell, as well as my friend @Ziroth, who organized a breakdown in a university lab. The burning question now becomes: \u201cIs Yoshino\u2019s battery actually solid state?\u201d And if it\u2019s not, why is the company calling it that in the first place? \n\nSpecial thanks:\nDr. Ali Khazaeli & TechInsights: https://undecided.link/TechInsights\nDr. Ryan Inis Hughes & Howard Richards - University of Bath \n@Ziroth - https://www.youtube.com/@ZirothTech\nDr. Tim Holme, Quantumscape - full interview: https://youtu.be/HpMmMvg1IxU?si=rr77GumEfjdrVdFO \nAnd all the others who worked behind the scenes with me to dig into this.\n\nWatch 5 BEST Things ",
