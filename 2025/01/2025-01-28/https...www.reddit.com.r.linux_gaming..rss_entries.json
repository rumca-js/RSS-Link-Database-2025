Games like rdr2, the witcher 3, etc.</p> <p>Questions: 1. So, which option is most optimal right now? (New models from vendors not interested me, i just want a good gpu) I look at rx7700xt/7800xt, idk situation around nvidia, these features that ma(-rketing)nufacturer put into their cards. But, maybe they are sells good cards, if those is more efficient, eat less PSU, colder itself? 2. Question about drivers and linux supporting. Which one is most stable and good on X11? I hear from edge of ear, that nvidia provided some open source kernel modules, but info was limited, maybe that&#39;s it and all what they are make that is some drivers for something like their mAIrketing features. What situation on AMD manufacturer?</p> <p>Thank you in advance for any recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/elon_mus\"> /",

Always loved everything about it, from how smooth and lightweight it is to the terminal and package managers. But I&#39;ve never really given gaming on it a try. So today I grabbed an old SSD, put it in my PC, installed Ubuntu 24.10 on it together with Steam, and that&#39;s genuinely all I needed to do to get gaming!

There&#39;s only a couple issues with anti cheat like with PUBG, and while I can play Star Citizen itself just fine, my eye/head tracker (Tobii 5) is not supported at all on Linux so for those two at least I&#39;ll have to keep Windows dual booted.</p> <p>But lo",
