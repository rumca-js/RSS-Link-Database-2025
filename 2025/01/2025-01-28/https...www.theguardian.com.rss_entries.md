<p>Crowds give life to the Paris museum and the painting is a silent, compelling mystery at the heart of the hubbub</p><p>What a wonderful headache for a museum to have. The Louvre in Paris gets so many visitors it is taking drastic measures to cope, which include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jan/28/mona-lisa-to-be-given-special-place-in-renovated-louvre-says-emmanuel-macron">moving its most famous treasure to a dedicated space</a> where fans can visit without entering the main museum at all. It will no longer suck the oxygen from other art. Nearly 9 million visitors a year stream through the Louvre and it’s believed 80% of them are looking for Leonardo da Vinci’s portrait of Lisa Gherardini del Giocondo, better known as La Gioconde, better still as the Mona Lisa.</p><p>I’m worried the Louvre is trying to solve a problem that is not really a problem. Ask Britain’s museums if high visitor numbers are a bad thing: they still haven’t recovered their pre-pandemi

<p>He used to fish for oysters but he fled to the hedonism of London, where he was taken under the wing of Derek Jarman. But Andy Marshall was also a creator of dazzling furniture – and the star of a pioneering film about gay life</p><p>It was 1982 and young film-maker Paul Oremland was in an east London leather and denim pub, about to meet a character who would change his life. “Andy was pretty unforgettable,” recalls Oremland. “Full of amazing tales, and with a wealth of knowledge about people, places and quirky London life.”</p><p>Oremland had been talking to the fledgling Channel 4 about making a series of documentary films about gay life. This was the era of Aids, Thatcher and queer bashing – gay people only ever seemed to be on the television as the subject of shame or the butt of a joke. But the proudly out Andy Marshall – with his beguiling mix of toughness and fragility – didn’t conform to these stereotypes. Oremland decided to feature him in one of the films he created for

<p>House deploys elegant visual allegory at Grand Palais to keep its name in lights during design interregnum</p><p>Designers come and go, but the Chanel tweed suit is for ever. That was the message from a show marking the 110th anniversary of haute couture at Chanel. The house is in the middle of more than a year of catwalk shows without a designer to take a bow – Virginie Viard made her final appearance last May, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/dec/14/chanel-opts-for-craft-over-celebrity-in-choice-of-new-creative-chief-matthieu-blazy">and her successor, Matthieu Blazy</a>, will not make his first until October – so it is working overtime to keep the Chanel name in lights.</p><p>The catwalk was formed of two broad curving walkways, which together formed the double C that is instantly recognisable as Chanel.

<p>A family seek a fresh start but their new home isn’t the haven of tranquility they were hoping for in this interesting but predictable thriller</p><p>This slowburn psychological thriller has come up with an interesting slant on the house-with-a-terrible-secret storyline. Based on a novel by the Guardian’s books editor Charlotte Northedge, it’s the story of Jess (Liz White), a charity fundraiser who’s swapped east London for Suffolk, buying a country pile with her husband Pete (Ray Fearon). The move is a fresh start for their marriage, but inevitably the couple’s problems follow them. And Jess’s identity, put on hold by a career break and motherhood, seems to unravel in unfamiliar surroundings, giving the movie an unsettling atmosphere.</p><p>The house is a fixer upper. So when Pete leaves to catch the six o’clock train to London, Jess’s job, after dropping their son Archie off at primary school, is to manage the building work (there is a vague plan for holiday lets on the grounds)

<p>The R1 chatbot has sent the tech world spinning – but this tells us less about China than it does about western neuroses</p><p>The arrival of DeepSeek R1, an AI language model built by the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, has been nothing less than seismic. The system only launched last week, but already the app has shot to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/china-s-deepseek-tops-iphone-downloads-and-drives-asia-stocks">top of download charts</a>, sparked a <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/global-shares-deepseek-tech-stocks-wall-street-nvdia-investors-b1207409.html">$1tn (£800bn)</a> sell-off of tech stocks, and elicited apocalyptic commentary in Silicon Valley. The simplest take on R1 is correct: it’s an AI system equal in capability to state-of-the-art US models that was built on a shoestring budget, thus demonstrating Chinese technological prowess. But the big lesson is perhaps not what DeepSeek R1 reveals about China, but about western neuroses

From the early 1980s, the likes of Crash, Mega, PC Gamer and the Official PlayStation Magazine were your connection with the industry, providing news, reviews and interviews as well as lively letters pages that fostered a sense of community. Very rarely, however, did anyone keep hold of their magazine collections. Lacking the cultural gravitas of music or movie publications, they were mostly thrown away. While working at Future Publishing as a games journalist in the 1990s, I watched many times as hundreds of old issues of SuperPlay, Edge and GamesMaster were tipped into skips for pulping.

Shackleton recounts his abortive attempt to make a film about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/30/zodiac-killer-jarett-kobek-california">the Zodiac serial killer,</a> who murdered at least five people in the San Francisco Bay Area without being caught, and whose case is still open.

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> The actor gives a subtle and sensitive performance in a quiet, beautifully filmed drama set in early 19th century America</p><p>There’s a certain type of movie one comes to expect from Sundance: a spare but beautifully filmed family drama featuring a reticent protagonist in an evocative rural setting, favoring quietness to the point of remoteness such that it doesn’t quite deliver on its emotional potential. At first glance, Train Dreams, starring Joel Edgerton as a devoted family man and isolated loner in the early 19th century logging business, seems like it will fall into the trap of stale airiness. At times it does, too maddeningly fascinated with the experience of rustic isolation and too reliant on the unsaid or assumed.
