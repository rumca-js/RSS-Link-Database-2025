<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As an undergrad with relatively little experience in deep learning, I’ve been trying to wrap my head around how modern AI works. </p> <p>From my understanding, Transformers are essentially neural networks with attention mechanisms, and neural networks themselves are essentially massive stacks of linear and logistic regression models with activations (like ReLU or sigmoid). Techniques like convolution seem to just modify what gets fed into the neurons but the overall scheme of things relatively stay the same.</p> <p>To me, this feels like AI development is mostly about scaling up and stacking older concepts, relying heavily on increasing computational resources rather than finding fundamentally new approaches. It seems somewhat brute-force and inefficient, but I might be too inexperienced to understand the reason behind it.</p> <p>My main question is: Are we currently advancing AI mainly by scaling up existing methods and throwing more resources at th

Every time I see people getting excited about AI, they often talk about use cases like marketing, content creation, building apps or SaaS products, or of course automating tasks like answering emails. Sure, those ideas are all very practical right now, but aren&#39;t they kind of... short-lived?</p> <p>Why would I want to read an article created by an AI when I can just have my own AI create an article that&#39;s personalized with exactly what I need? Or why read an AI-generated email when AI can summarize it, reply to it, or handle it entirely for me?</p> <p>And this same logic applies to many apps and SaaS products: why use a weather app when the forecast is a (voice) prompt and API call away?

## Question about chain of thought (CoT) in LLMs

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies, this is probably a stupid question, but: am I right in thinking that CoT outputs from LLMs are a pure fabrication, only generated after the LLM has generated its response to the user&#39;s tokenised prompt, and as such they are not actually providing any insight into how a model &#39;reasons&#39; to build its response to the prompt?</p> <p>I&#39;ve always assumed it&#39;s essentially the equivalent of instructing the LLM to do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Generate a response to this prompt</li> <li>Before printing the output from (1), generate and print a chain of thought style narrative which describes how an LLM might decide to generate the response from (1) if it had an internal logical reasoning narrative</li> <li>Print the output from (1)</li> </ol> <p>Is that correct? I ask because I keep seeing people writing about- and reacting to these CoT extracts as if they&#39;re reading a genuine log of an LLM&#39;s internal narrative from when

This is the core of who you are: the sum of your experiences, your emotions, your thoughts, your awareness. It’s the place where all of your sense of &quot;I&quot; resides. You are the thinker, the doer, the experiencer—at the center of your own subjective universe. From this point, you’re navigating the world with a sense of agency, a sense of control. You choose how to act, what to value, what to create, and how to interpret what happens to you.

On one hand, it is shocking that the market &quot;overreacted&quot; to this news to this extent, but it is not shocking once you discover what is happening. The US limited chips to China and this backfired because the team at DeepSeek figured out a way to work around this and used creativity and innovation to program their LLM&#39;s to do what OpenAI does at a fraction of the cost. Although, their access to chips, the number of chips used, and the type of chips is in question. This is damaging to the predictions made about the requirements and funding needed to power AI in the future. </p> <p>This is not great news for OpenAI and the other models which are closed source because DeepSeek has released their program as open source and it is already available on GitHub, so anyone can access it.

For example, some people were criticizing GPT for its poor performance in coding. Then a new model came along and they were super disappointed with image generation. But the reasoning part has been improving super rapidly. As a user, why not focus on the strongest ability the AI has? For example, recently we saw a leap in reasoning, pondering long prompts and providing a logical, structured answer. This part alone could theoretically be used to enhance 99% of the lives of billions of people (for example to optimize schedule, studying techniques, workflow, creative engineering, data analysis and problem solving).
