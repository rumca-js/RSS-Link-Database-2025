Based on a novel by the Guardian\u2019s books editor Charlotte Northedge, it\u2019s the story of Jess (Liz White), a charity fundraiser who\u2019s swapped east London for Suffolk, buying a country pile with her husband Pete (Ray Fearon). The move is a fresh start for their marriage, but inevitably the couple\u2019s problems follow them. And Jess\u2019s identity, put on hold by a career break and motherhood, seems to unravel in unfamiliar surroundings, giving the movie an unsettling atmosphere.</p><p>The house is a fixer upper. So when Pete leaves to catch the six o\u2019clock train to London, Jess\u2019s job, after dropping their son Archie off at primary school, is to manage the building work (there is a vague plan for holiday lets on the grounds)",

At first glance, Train Dreams, starring Joel Edgerton as a devoted family man and isolated loner in the early 19th century logging business, seems like it will fall into the trap of stale airiness. At times it does, too maddeningly fascinated with the experience of rustic isolation and too reliant on the unsaid or assumed. Like fellow Sundance premiere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/24/omaha-review-john-magaro-sundance\">Omaha</a>, Train Dreams compensates for a terse male lead with the grand, rapturously filmed scene",
