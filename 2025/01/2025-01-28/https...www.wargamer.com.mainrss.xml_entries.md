								<p>Never mind my beloved Space Marines and their massive shoulders - <strong>Warhammer 40k Aspect Warriors</strong> are <em>painfully</em> cool in ways that the Imperium's stompy men can only dream of, and their gorgeous new 2025 model range is a landmark moment for Warhammer 40,000 fans. These specialized, brightly colored <strong>Aeldari</strong> elite fighters have been around since 40k's earliest days - but, with gloriously revamped Warp Spiders, Fire Dragons, and Swooping Hawks around the corner, it's worth reviewing why these space elves are so damn interesting.</p>

								<p>Out of seemingly nowhere, <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> has released a new playtest for upcoming subclasses. Three are reworks of older options, five are entirely new, and all are thick with Forgotten Realms flavor. Given that we’re expecting a new player-focused guide to that famous D&amp;D setting in 2025, this makes a lot of sense. What <i>is</i> surprising is just how nasty one of these new subclasses is.</p>

								<p>The popular grass type <strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> deck starring Celebi Ex is suddenly winning tournaments, taking first place in the biggest competition for the TCG app two weeks in a row. This comes just as the game nears its biggest update yet, with a massive influx of cards set to shake up the meta, and probably consign it the dustbin.</p>
