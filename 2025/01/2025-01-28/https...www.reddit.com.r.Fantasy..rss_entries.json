I was hoping to have some recommendations based on my tastes. Here are some takes of it :</p> <p>I really loved A Song Of Ice And Fire, because of the complexity of the world, it\u2019s geopolitical aspect, the schemes and the darkness of it. Also it\u2019s well written, there are a lot of memorable quotes and moments.</p> <p>Also the french fantasy book \u00ab Gagner La Guerre \u00bb from JP Jaworski, Im not sure it has been translated into English, but I definitely recommend. </p> <p>But on another hand I didn\u2019t like the black company, because I think the world is a bit off. I like a really strong world structure (ASOIAF).</p> <p>I don\u2019t really like manichaean worlds, that\u2019s why I\u2019m hesitating to start LOTR books. </p> <p>I love the Witcher 3 game, but I don\u2019t really like Geralt, he is too much of a 80s main character, he\u2019s perfect, every women loves him\u2026 I think he is boring.

What I loved most about the show were its reflections on memory, sentimentality, and the passage of time. For those unfamiliar, <em>Frieren</em> is a reflective fantasy about an elven mage who outlives her human companions and regrets taking their fleeting lives for granted. As she revisits their shared journey and meets those they impacted, she learns to cherish the present and the bonds she forms, despite the inevitability of loss.</p> <p>I especially enjoyed the bittersweet moments when Frieren reflects on the past while revisiting places tied to her companions, slowly realizing how much their bond meant to her. I\u2019ve received recommendations like <em>Age of Adeline</em> and <em>Outlander</em>, but neither fully captures the memory-focused, bittersweet tone that resonated with me. </p> <p>I prefer epics, but I get that",

Last year I read great series like Memory Sorrow and Thorn, The Dagger and the Coin, re-read LOTR, and a few others. However, for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve been unable to get into any fantasy/sci-fi. I tried to read Stormlight Archive after a friend recommended it, but it just did not grip me at all after about 200 pages so I DNF&#39;d.</p> <p>So, I seriously need recommendations for books and/or series that will get me out of this reading slump. Preferably low-ish medieval fantasy, but I&#39;m honestly open to anything, so long as you think it will get me to read again.

Even better when there are multiple constrained systems working against each other. </p> <p>I do love Sandersons mistborn series for that reason, but not a huge fan of his other stuff. Not for the lack of good constraints, just because they&#39;re not as fun and interesting. </p> <p>Just my thoughts. Completely happy for you to rip me a new one or share your thoughts.
