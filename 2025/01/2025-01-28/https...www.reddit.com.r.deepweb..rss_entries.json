He wrote in his suicide note he procured Nembutal from a country where it is still legal. My mom gave his laptop to the CIA as he was military in hopes to find answers and here\u2019s what we got: -my father had bitcoin (we haven\u2019t had any access to any of his crypto, and the CIA kept the laptop). -my father wrote emails to a Mexican doctor and lied saying he had brain cancer (my father had borderline personality disorder and ptsd). - he managed to have the Nembutal sent to a P.O. Box away from the military base he lived on. - my father died in 2011 but got the Nembutal about a year prior. </p> <p>How common was it back then to just get Nembutal? How can I get my dad\u2019s crypto (if even possible)? Did he find this doctor on Silk Road or another website that was as popular back",
