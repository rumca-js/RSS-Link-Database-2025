I record long play sessions for my YouTube channel where I review games because I love having great looking footage. Fast forward to a week weeks ago and I finally got myself a new headset, a Meta Quest 3S. I was excited for the exclusives and the ability to play my PC VR games wire free.</p> <p>My problem: I can not find a way to record good looking footage. If I use VR View and OBS the frame rate is terrible and jittery. If I use the application window with OBS it&#39;s terribly cropped and jittery. If I record directly from the headset it&#39;s choppy and I can&#39;t get application audio through the video.</p> <p>I want to begin recording a game for my new video, so I suppose I&#39;ll be busting out my old headset for the time being. But, if anyone out there has a solution I would love to hear it. Thank you so much in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

## Is going from a 5800x3D to a 9800x3D (with RTX4090) enough of an increase in VR performance to be worth the hassle?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all. I currently have a 5800x3D with 32GB RAM and an RTX4090 and a Quest Pro. I am considering an upgrade to a 9800x3D with 64GB RAM and am wondering if the increase in VR performance is worth the inconvenience of rebuilding my PC? I am not talking about cost, but more the time and effort of building and reinstalling everything.</p> <p>I assume 1% lows and stuttering may be improved in addition to overall FPS? I am playing all kinds of games from SkyrimVR MGO to racing/flight sims to FPS to UEVR, basically almost the full range of use cases.</p> <p>I had a hard time finding good info on 9800x3D VR performance so hence I am asking the community in case anyone did similar and has any feedback on if the performance difference will be noticeable or not really worth it. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TotalWarspammer"> /u/TotalWarspammer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtual

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ive only really got two or three games. I need to balance my VR games between PC and dedicated Quest 3S. It’s kind of fun to know I have big deal VR games on PC but equally fun games on Quest 3S. </p> <p>I’ve already got Home Sports for that Wii sports fix (honestly not as good as Wii sports), Compound (near-perfect). Population One (team play). </p> <p>I’m looking for another game, single player, that can either be so entertaining and in-depth that I’m not missing anything or is so diverse in gameplay that I’m not thinking I’m missing out on a dedicated single player adventure. </p> <p>Simply put, games that have 50 games in 1 or some big deal adventure single player game? I’m looking at carnival VR, I’m looking at Arcade Paradise VR. </p> <p>I don’t want another fps game unless I can do H3VR on quest standalone. I’ve already got no mans sky on pc, already got gzdoom vr. Pretty sure I can slowly and painfully learn to sideload light gun games…</p> <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I once had a Quest 2 that I sold 4-5 years ago since I needed the money. I had about 350 hours in SteamVR as I only played PCVR with a link cable. I&#39;m looking to get back into PCVR as I can afford a VR Headset again. I still have the same PC which has a 5600X CPU, RTX 3080 and 32GB of RAM. Is the Quest 3 the best way to go? I have not kept up with VR other then seeing the Quest 3. I will only be using PCVR with a link cable again to my PC. I don&#39;t plan to use the Quest 3 itself for gaming as I will always play PCVR via link cable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Abram367"> /u/Abram367 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ibta3m/looking_to_get_into_pcvr_again/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ibta3m/looking_to_get_into_pcvr_again/">[comments]</a></span>
