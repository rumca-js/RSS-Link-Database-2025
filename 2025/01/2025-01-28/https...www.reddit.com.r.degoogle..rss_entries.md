<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yes, I promise to pay YouTube Premium if it really would stop ads. I’d use Google Search If it wouldn’t share my search history with the authorities. I promise to disable my adblocker, And watch ads if Google makes it clear they won’t spy on my activity to target me with ads. Yes, I’d trade my data, If they promise to give me better results, not just show me stuff they wanna sell me. I’d use Chrome, But only if it didn’t turn me into a walking data profile. I’d sign in to Gmail, If it meant no more spam and at least a hint of privacy. I’d trust Google Maps, If they didn’t know exactly where I was at 3 AM when I just couldn’t sleep. I’d even try Google Drive, If it promised not to casually share my files with the NSA. Oh Google, I’d love to use your services, But can we just have a little more transparency and a lot less tracking, please? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent-Age5347"> /u/Co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In recent years, I’ve dedicated significant time and effort to breaking free from the clutches of big tech firms and their restrictive walled gardens. While I’m far from where I want to be, I’ve developed a clear, actionable plan that I’m executing over the next 12 months. The essence of this plan is straightforward: self-host services where feasible or pay ethical companies to host them for me.</p> <p>Why am I rejecting free services and subscription ecosystems? Because they all share two fundamental flaws:</p> <ol> <li>They trade in user data, anonymized or not, and I fundamentally reject the idea that my data is the product.</li> <li>They lock users into walled gardens by storing data in proprietary formats that hinder easy transfer to other platforms—even when industry standards, like CalDav, exist to enable portability. These companies deliberately make migration difficult because they’re afraid you’ll leave. This forces customers to stay, even

It may be beneficial if someone wants to do it on PI, 1l PC or any other hardware on hand.</p> <ol> <li>Hardware:I was about to go with Pi, but there was the time of shortage of those devices. So the second obvious choice (and better in my opinion) was 1L PC - HP, Dell, Lenovo. I went for whatever fit in my ~100usd budget and had 2 HDD (for backup needs) - HP 8th gen Intel with 16GB RAM, 1SSD + 1M.2 was my choice.</li> </ol> <p>For HomeAssistant I got Sonoff USB dongle for ZigBee and re-flashed it.</p> <ol> <li>Main OS:<br/> I went the rabbit hole of having HA installed on bare metal, then Ubuntu server with things on top.<br/> But final solution is for me ProxMox. It is simple and intuitive system that is also rock solid. And here
