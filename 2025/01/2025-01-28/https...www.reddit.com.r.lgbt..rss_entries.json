It&#39;s mainly a matter of convincing my wife that we have to go. We&#39;re lucky to live in a blue state at least.</p> <p>I&#39;m definitely going to apply for my passport. I was thinking either the UK or New Zealand. The biggest problem is I only speak English and a little bit of French, Spanish and German. </p> <p>I really don&#39;t know where to go.</p> <p>Edit: I work in ECE (Early Childhood Education) and I&#39;m working on a Software Development degree. My partner works in Cybersecurity. I imagine her job is fairly indemand but I don&#39;t know how much demand there is for ECE teachers.</p> <p>Edit 2: I KNOW it takes more than a passport. That&#39;s more of getting the process started at least. Also we&#39;re not super rich or poor.

Like many of you, the news and social media has been terrifying for me since the election and worse since the inauguration. However, during this time, I have also found a boyfriend (21m) who I can&#39;t stop thinking about, and who has become a sounding board to help me calm myself down. I have known I was gay since I was 13 or 14, but this is the first time I&#39;ve felt what I believe could be a genuine love for someone else. I wanted to share this because, contrary to what they want us to believe, these feelings are never wrong. And just because one orange mother fucker sits in the white house, does not mean that we cannot find love anymore. I have found so much power in the simple act of holding his hand in a mall, or kissing him where others can see. I do not mean that the only way to fight is to",
