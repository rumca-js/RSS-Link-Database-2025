<p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-arc-abilities-revealed-for-episode-heresy/1100-6528871/">Destiny 2: Heresy</a> arrives early next month, players will find themselves back on the Dreadnaught, the Hive ship that's been left adrift since The Taken King expansion. And while players have fought inside the ship before, the Dreadnaught has undergone some changes since its last appearance. </p><p>"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience," said Nikko Stevens--Destiny 2's Narrative Architect--during a feature <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/">on PlayStation's official site</a>.

<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, and it has forced the two opposing sides to improvise weapons during the conflict. That's why the European Union is reportedly proposing a ban on all video game console sales to Russia.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9d19e104-4c2d-4210-ae18-7093f3860c57">Financial Times</a>, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas indicated that PlayStation and Xbox consoles may land on the sanctions list because Russia has used them to "operate drones."</p><p>Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony stopped selling their consoles in Russia in March 2022, roughly a month after the Russian invasion began. However, that didn't stop second-hand sellers from getting consoles to Russian buyers. The proposed sanctions would be aimed at closing off that loophole.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/european-union-is-reportedly-planning-to-ban-video-game-console-sales-to-russia/1100-6529083/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading

<p dir="ltr">Not every game needs to be more like IO Interactive's Hitman, but some games would benefit from adopting more of that incredible series' strong points. This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance/">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu.</p><p dir="ltr">Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like oth

<p>Microsoft has clarified that World of Warcraft is not coming to Xbox Game Pass. This comes after people received an email showing a World of Warcraft ad with the words "Join Game Pass," leading them to believe that the game would be coming to the subscription service.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ic3q9w/gamepass_and_world_of_warcraft/">email's subject even said</a>, "Play Call of Duty, Diablo IV, World of Warcraft, and more of Activision's biggest hits with Game Pass!" The World of Warcraft portion of the email also featured an icon suggesting an Xbox console release of the game was coming. Microsoft has now issued a statement attributing all of this to a simple error.</p><p>"This was a mistake on our end, sorry for the confusion," said the official Game Pass <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1884300203882053922">Twitter account</a>.

<p>Most of the early research into video games seemed to be designed to find a link between in-game violence and its effects on players in the real world. More recently, there have been studies about the adverse affects of gaming addiction. However, there's now research that suggests playing games may actually be beneficial for players, depending upon the type of the game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/VIDEO-GAMES/MENTAL-HEALTH/akpeewkqgpr/">Reuters</a>, the majority of the research into the benefits of gaming focuses on cozy video games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-getaway/1900-6417431/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. These casual games are designed to be soothing to play and almost impossible to lose. That genre also avoids putting players into overly stressful situations.</p><p>Hiroyuki Egami, an assistant professor at Nihon University, published a study conducted in Japan between 2020-

But there have been a handful of leaks and rumors about Call of Duty 2025, including a rumor that it's a sequel to Black Ops 2 set in the 2030s.</p><p>In this post, we're rounding up everything we know, and what's been rumored, about the next Call of Duty.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>

His solo series gave him a necktie, a subtle hair wave, smaller nostrils, and a furrowed brow that always made him look slightly perturbed.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-ref-id="2300-6465596" data-src="/videos/nintendo-switch-2-official-first-look-reveal-trailer/2300-6465596/" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="0">          <iframe height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen

<p dir="ltr">First a hello, then sent to hell. That's the scenario the actor behind Grand Theft Auto V's Trevor would like to see for the character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. While Steve Ogg hasn't reportedly done any work on the next entry in the franchise, he'd love to see Trevor "pass the torch" to new leads in a way that sees his brains turning into pink goo.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg explained that his wish for GTA VI is "if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning." This would be a full-circle moment for Trevor if Rockstar followed along with Ogg's suggestion. That's because Trevor kills GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned protagonist Johnny Klebitz in GTA V. "Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over," Ogg said.
