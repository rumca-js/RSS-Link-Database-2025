## How much better are entry level printers now than 5 years ago?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>5 years ago I bought a <strong>Creality Ender 3 Pro</strong> for 190 EUR. For these 5 years, it has served me amazingly well. Haven&#39;t ever had the thought of upgrading. Just a bit of maintenance here and there, but it&#39;s still running like a champ.</p> <p>I have also been living under a rock when it comes to 3D printing, so I have no idea what the market is currently like. What has changed? What features are now standard across all printers? What can you expect to get nowadays for 200-300 EUR? (in comparison to something like an Ender 3 Pro from 5 years ago)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KyxeMusic"> /u/KyxeMusic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1ibzbvn/how_much_better_are_entry_level_printers_now_than/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1ibzbvn/how_much_better_are_entry_level_printers_now_than/">[comm
