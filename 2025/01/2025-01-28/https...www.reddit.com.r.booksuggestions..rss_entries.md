<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tiny spoiler for Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Don&#39;t read this if you&#39;re wanting to watch it and haven&#39;t yet.</p> <p>I was just watching The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Can someone recommend a book similar to some themes in that movie? I love how Coriolanus loves Lucy Gray. I want a book where the guy meets a girl, and they get separated. Then the guy leaves behind his previous life to chase after the girl, even thought it&#39;s dangerous. Bonus points if the guy protects the girl in fights and dangerous situations. And extra bonus points if it&#39;s a grumpy x sunshine trope. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cass195"> /u/Cass195 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1icd84c/books_like_coriolanus_snow_and_lucy_gray_bairds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1icd84c/book

If I‚Äôm going to start reading, I want it to be something that will help me grow personally or professionally.</p> <p>So, I‚Äôm hoping you guys can recommend something that fits this vibe. Ideally, something easy to read so I can actually finish it and get that sense of accomplishment. I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôll give me the confidence to keep going with more books.</p> <p>Would really appreciate your suggestions. Thanks a ton!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I dont really know how to explain this, but I think I&#39;m looking for philosophical books. I&#39;m interested in books that may change my thoughts or perception of life. Like, what is life? What is love? Things like that. Not that it has to be a textbook, and I don&#39;t want it to be. I&#39;ve read a couple Dostoevsky books and The Death of Ivan Ilych by Tolstoy and I really enjoyed the books I&#39;ve read. I think I can really understand and internalize what the author is saying. Like being highly critical and looking at other perspectives, thinking about what or how it would be like to be in the characters shoes. </p> <p>I&#39;ve really been thinking about how life is short, and that I should unapologetically be myself. I&#39;ve even bought a few &quot;self-help&quot; type books about confidence and such to learn from them. </p> <p>Honestly, IDK.

I like a good story whether it‚Äôs fiction or non fiction, but I‚Äôve also enjoyed reading different things. I read a book for English called atomic habits. I really enjoyed it, but I‚Äôve also liked reading stuff like Fah
