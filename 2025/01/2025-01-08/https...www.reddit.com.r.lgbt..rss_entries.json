I immediately shut that down and said I did not like them.

I had to work hard to create this circumstance(not the white part, obviously), and a lot of it included isolating myself from other queer people and my family. it was difficult. Now, people on the whole don&#39;t take issue with the way I live my life. However, when it does become an issue is when I have to confront people when they don&#39;t have a filter for talking about queer topics in public. It&#39;s not a bad thing to feel comfortable with your community. But you should understand the position you&#39;re putting people in when you talk about the specifics of <em>their</em> identity where it could be overheard. You could be, indirectly, be putting them in harms way. </p> <p>There is one part of this issue, which is the reality that not everyone has the same level of hyper-awareness.
