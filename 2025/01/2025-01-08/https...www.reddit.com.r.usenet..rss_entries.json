Newsdemon offers SlickVPN access but only to locations in USA, UK and Singapore.</p> <p>So I was wondering if this special Eweka deal with VPN included would support more locations or specifically regions like India. Or would you recommend me any cheap VPN service for this? I don&#39;t use VPN often. Only a few times a year. I know that Eweka is a better Usenet provider because of it&#39;s retention so the little higher price might be worth it anyway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CptDayDreamer\"> /u/CptDayDreamer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hwnkmk/eweka_included_vpn/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comment",

I joined easynews for there $2 a month plan and it seems great for the price. Some shows i cant find using easy news but I can find with NZBgeek (currently using the trial but willing to pay). Is there a way I can download the nzb file for the show and then download using my easynews subscription using an ipad preferably?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NSS1989\"> /u/NSS1989 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hwg0n2/nzbgeek_with_easynews/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hwg0n2/nzbgeek_with_easynews/\">[comments]</a></span>",
