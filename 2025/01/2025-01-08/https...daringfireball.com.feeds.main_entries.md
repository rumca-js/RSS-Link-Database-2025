<p>2006 post from yours truly that applies perfectly <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/bbc_news_apple_intelligence_notification_summaries">to Apple Intelligence today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sentiment here is that it’s somehow unfair to developers
to treat software labeled “beta” with the same critical eye
as non-beta software. That’s true, in the case of actual beta
software, where by “actual beta” I mean “not yet released,
but close”.</p>

<p>Released vs. not-released is the distinction that warrants
critical restraint. Film critics don’t write reviews of rough
cuts. Book critics don’t review non-final manuscripts of novels.</p>

<p>Released software that is labeled “beta” is still released
software, and is fair game for the same level of criticism as any
released software. You can’t “semi-release” your 1.0 just because
you want it out there but aren’t yet finished. Being semi-released
is like being semi-pregnant. [...]</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier today Casey Newton’s remarkable 2019 piece for The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa">Bodies in Seats</a>”, an eye-opening look at the lives of content moderators at a large Facebook contractor in Tampa. When I linked to it at the time, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this is what it takes to moderate Facebook, it’s an indictment
of the basic concept of Facebook itself. In theory it sounds like
a noble idea to let everyone in the world post whatever they want
and have it be connected and amplified to like-minded individuals.</p>

<p>In practice, it’s a disaster.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t the “everyone can post whatever they want” — that’s the nature of the internet, and I truly believe it has
democratized communication in a good way. The disastrous part is
the “be connected and amplified to like-minded individuals”.
That’s the difference between Facebook (and to some d
