<p><strong><em>The following article discusses adult themes.</em></strong></p>
<p>There was a legend in my high school about turning your PlayStation 2 into an ersatz vibrator by creating a custom skate park in <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3</em>. Build a circular grind rail, turn off the ability to fall, jump on it and your DualShock would launch into a never ending frenzy of haptic feedback. It’s an idea the team at Motorbunny is taking to its logical conclusion, adding a wireless controller for its eponymous ride on sex toy that can connect to a DualSense controller. Its pitch is that you’ll be able to combine getting your game on with getting off. And yes, I am ashamed for writing that sentence.</p>

<p>Meta is continuing to overhaul its moderation and content rules. Instagram head Adam Mosseri posted today that Instagram and Threads will start including political content in recommendations. It's a reversal from the policy the two platforms adopted <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-and-threads-will-no-longer-recommend-political-content-180521125.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-and-threads-will-no-longer-recommend-political-content-180521125.html"><ins>last year</ins></a>, which made political content something users had to choose if they wanted to see. Now, Mosseri said that there will be three levels of political content that Instagram and Threads users can pick to see: less, standard (which will be the default) and more.</p>
<p>"It’s proven impractical to draw a red line around what is and is not political content," Mosseri wrote. The change will begin 

## A holographic windshield from Hyundai Mobis is a big upgrade for in-car HUDs at CES 2025

<p>Automotive heads up displays (HUDs) have been around as far back as 1988, and while they’ve gotten brighter and more colorful over the years, even today’s most sophisticated implementations still feel a bit primitive. But after seeing what Hyundai Mobis (which makes auto parts for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis) is calling the world’s first full-windshield holographic display at CES 2025, it felt like I was looking at a major evolution in-car infotainment.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional reflective HUDs, Hyundai Mobis’ holographic windshield display (HWD) consists of two main components: a projector (or in this case multiple projectors) hidden beneath the dash and a special optical film with a carefully tuned wavelength sensitivity embedded inside the windshield itself. This combination allows the HWD to pump out brighter and more colorful images with much shallower viewing angles. Unless you’re sitting in the right spot, you may not even see the HUD at all.</p>

If nothing else, the device could allow you to hide your A/V gear in plain sight within a floor lamp when you&#39;re not using it. LG intends for it to be tucked away in a living space, at the end of couch or behind an end table for example.</p>
<p>The PF600U isn&#39;t a great name, so I hope LG comes up with something better before this thing goes on sale. As a projector, the PF600U offers

<p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will add non-player characters powered by NVIDIA ACE generative AI. These PUBG Allies are being dubbed Co-Playable Characters, and they can have real-time conversations with a player about what&#39;s happening in a match. They can also adapt their strategies and gameplay to work with the player&#39;s style. Krafton, the battle royale&#39;s publisher, demoed this technology at CES 2025.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to innovate user experiences by integrating CPC into our games and aim to establish it as a benchmark for the gaming industry,&quot; said Kangwook Lee, head of Krafton&#39;s deep learning division. Krafton will also publish upcoming life simulator <em>inZOI</em>, and had a CES demo of a CPC in that game as well.</p>

They&#39;re basically super-powered versions of the company&#39;s Ryzen AI hardware with up to 16 CPU cores and 50 RDNA 3.5 graphics cores, alongside a pool of as much as 128GB integrated RAM. AMD claims the Ryzen AI Max chips will deliver up to 2.6 times faster 3D rendering than Intel&#39;s Core Ultra 9 288V, as well as 1.4 times better graphics performance.</p>
<p>Squint a bit, and you might think AMD was taking a bit of inspiration from Apple Silicon, with its powerful CPU cores, graphics and unified memory. But according to VP Joe Macri, AMD was building towards this long before Apple. &quot;We were building APUs [chips combining CPUs and Radeon graphics] while Apple was using discrete GPUs. They were using <em>our</em> discrete GPUs. So I don&#39;t credit Apple wit

<p>I have to admit — I used to be very skeptical of LED devices that purport to be good for your skin. When they first started being sold for home use, I felt like they were mostly expensive, ineffective appliances that were obvious cash grabs. Nowadays, though, as is usually the case with any burgeoning category of products, the technology has improved. We're seeing more sophisticated offerings that not only use better components, but are more comfortable to wear.

Every year the big chipmakers announce new products and the big computer manufacturers unveil new laptops that take advantage of updated CPUs and GPUs.

<p>While there&#39;s plenty of automotive news to go around at CES 2025, far and away, the talk of the show is the Afeela 1. Again. For five years now, Sony has been showing off some variation on this same theme, first as the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-sony-vision-s.html"><ins>Vision-S</ins></a> in 2020, then the <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-vision-s-02-electric-suv-mobility-inc-071335668.html"><ins>Vision-S 02</ins></a>, before adopting the unfortunate rebranding to <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-honda-mobility-officially-unveils-its-collaborative-ev-concept-first-look-ces-2023-015133456.html"><ins>Afeela in 2023</ins></a>, and this year finally to Afeela 1.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that sucks the fun out of darts, it’s the mandatory math you have to do in order to work out how well you’re doing. That’s the malady British manufacturer Target Darts, making its first trip to CES, is solving with its Omni automatic scoring system, saving your beer-drenched brain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Omni is a halo that magnetically attaches to a compatible board, equipped with four 1080p cameras and an LED light strip. When you throw your darts, the system uses computer vision to identify where they ended up on the board.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>From there, the scores will be represented on a nearby computer or tablet, and can even be output to a big TV in the vicinity. Even better, is that you won’t just have your score tracked, but you’ll hear a pre-recorded voice telling you how many points you need to score on your next throw, just as you see in a professional match.</p>
<p>Omni isn’t out just yet, but when it launches, players will be able

<p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of e-bikes: Ones with a motor in one of the wheels, and ones with the motor mounted between the pedals. Those in the former group, known as <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/honbikes-e-bike-of-the-future-is-perfect-for-cities-133014272.html">hub motors</a>, are cheap and bountiful, but lack the oomph required to cover rough terrain and high inclines. Those in the latter group, known as <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/cargo-cycling-climate-change-emissions-babboe-130049736.html">mid-drive motors</a>, have all the power, but are heavy on the wallet as well on your arms as you lug them around. Consequently, I’m excited by what Urtopia turned up with to CES 2025: Titanium Zero, a 3D-printed titanium concept e-bike weighing less than 20 pounds packing Quark DM1.2, a custom-designed mid-drive motor that’s small enough to fit inside the bottom bracket and weighs just 2.6 pounds on its own.

<p>This isn’t just any retro-styled microphone, but an all-in-one tool for music creators looking to record vocals when on the go. It’s the creation of Hisong, a startup looking to build a more elegant alternative to toting around a microphone, mixer and headphones wherever you go. The AirStudio One is a wireless condenser microphone with a few secrets buried inside, like a professional audio interface, a wireless USB-C dongle and a pair of true wireless headphones. The idea being you can record a banging vocal when you’re on the road without any additional hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AirStudio One isn’t just a regular microphone, either, since it’s been engineered with a multi-core Digital Signal Processor to help get the best sound from its slender body. Open the companion app on your phone, and you’ll be able to mix the audio, set the EQ and even apply audio effects in real time. This isn&#39;t the first product we&#39;ve seen this CES that puts more of the meat inside the microphone —

This is the actual intent of the refresh.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Google says the automatic software update to Android 13 will “reduce your battery&#39;s runtime and charging performance” but that it’s necessary to “improve the stability” of each device. That’s the only explanation the company offered. We reached out to Google to ask for a specific reason as to why this was necessary.</p>

<p>The CES keynote will never be the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my 12th CES, so there aren&#39;t many things that surprise me at this point, at least in terms of press conferences. All of the big companies used to try to one-up each other (celebrity appearances were the main method, although it&#39;s not as common now).

But Naughty Dog head Neil Druckmann also teased an "location-based experience exhibit" that would transport participants into the tunnels of Seattle filled with Infected. That's an area straight out of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and today I got a chance to try the proof-of-concept experience.

<p>Well, alongside donating to Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, replacing policy chief Nick Clegg with a former George W. Bush aide and even adding Trump’s buddy (and UFC CEO) Dana White to its board… yeah. Probably.</p>
<p>Meta blocked Trump from using his accounts on its platforms for years after he stoked the flames of the attempted coup of January 6, 2021. At the time, Zuckerberg said, “His decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his

<p>The device is still a prototype, according to the company, but the as yet unnamed robo vac was on full display at Dreame’s CES booth. Considering it’s still a prototype, the actual arm looked far more substantial compared to the one on <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/home/roborocks-new-flagship-robot-vacuum-has-an-arm-that-can-grab-small-objects-170020390.html">Roborock’s Saros Z70</a>.

<p>Surprising no one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang isn&#39;t too worried about a future filled with robots and superintelligent AI. In fact, he welcomes it. During a CES Q&amp;A session with media and analysts, Huang was asked if he thought intelligent robots would ultimately side with humans, or against them. &quot;With the humans, because we&#39;re going to build them that way,&quot; he replied confidently.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of superintelligence is not unusual,&quot; Huang continued. &quot;I have a company with many many people who are superintelligent in their field of work. I&#39;m surrounded by superintelligence. And I prefer to be surrounded by superintelligence than the alternative.&quot;</p>

<p>Longstanding solar generator company Jackery is leveling up the US’ roof game with the introduction of XBC curved solar shingles. Debuting at CES 2025, Jackery’s curved solar roof tiles come in terracotta or obsidian, designed to match some of the most common house styles in the country. While solar shingles definitely already exist in the US, these are the first with a wavy aesthetic. It sounds like HOA presidents everywhere just lost one more excuse for preventing your rooftop solar installation.</p>
