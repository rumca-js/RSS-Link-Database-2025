A coder will need to write 1000 lines of code rather than 100 etc. Writers will need to write 5,000 words a day rather than 500-1000. </p> <p>The issue here though, is that it there might not be enough demand for all this output.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>First of all, while i&#39;m asking this question, i&#39;m being 100% honest, that i&#39;m really looking for a reason to be excited. The purpose of this text, is just i want to hear different opinions on this. I&#39;m not judging, venting or anything. This is not a post like &quot;I hate AI, it&#39;ll change everything, it&#39;ll destroy us, it&#39;ll take our jobs&quot; etc. I am honestly asking this question.</p> <p>For the couple of weeks, i&#39;ve been following the posts on this subreddit from a close distance. I&#39;ve been checking comments, posts, ideas, theories and everything.</p> <p>Right now, i think we all can say, that we are in the middle of a &quot;change&quot;. Changes, are scarry most of the time, i know, but mostly humanity adapt to these changes or to the new &quot;eras&quot;. This time tho, according to my observations, this time it is a little bit different.</p> <p>I am not talking about Youtube or social

My friends who initially used it have reported discovering new perspectives they missed while reading alone.</p> <p>I built this because meaningful reflection is key to personal growth.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last year, there were bold predictions that by the end of 2024, we&#39;d be generating feature-length films (1.5 hours) with a single prompt. As we&#39;re now in 2025, it&#39;s clear we&#39;re not quite there yet - at least not publicly.</p> <p>But here&#39;s what I&#39;m really excited about: Imagine a Netflix-like service that generates unlimited AI movies specifically tailored to your preferences. It could either work through direct input of your interests or by analyzing your social media activity to understand your taste (with permission, of course).</p> <p>Just think about the possibilities - every movie perfectly matched to your interests, no more endless scrolling trying to find something to watch. Personally, I&#39;m dying to see more high-quality cyberpunk content, as I feel the genre is underserved in traditional media.</p> <p>What about you?</p> <ul> <li>What genres or movie concepts would you want to see if this technology existed?</li>
