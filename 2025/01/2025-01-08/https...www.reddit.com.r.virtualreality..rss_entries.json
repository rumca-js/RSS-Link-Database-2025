That is, atleast the following games ive tested ran kinda well letting aside some expected texture loading issues: RE2 VR, RE7 VR, ALIEN ISOLATION VR, SUBNAUTICA VR (with submersed vr mod), MINECRAFT VR and VRCHAT.</p> <p>Now i couldnt dream of running re8vr properly lol, and having subnautica be on low for anything close to 70+ fps really doesnt go well since the lod is so small, and id love to have textures loading properly and play other vr games in higher settings (just enough to balance the visuals and performance to a nice looking level) so im aiming for maybe a second hand nvidia gpu, since I wanna get into blender and heard amd may be considerably slower for it</p> <p>Im thinking of maybe a 3060 due to the 12gb ram on a cheaper range, ",

A quote from a developer at the Nvidia forums:</p> <p>--- &quot;VR is not supported with DLSS framegen mostly since framegen uses a dxgi swapchain to present frames to a window. But VR uses a completely separate runtime to present images to an HMD.&quot; ---</p> <p>But UEVR (Unreal Engine 4/5 VR Injector) games can&#39;t really be classed as native VR, tho&#39; they do require the same OpenXR or OpenVR runtimes that SteamVR uses to be able to &#39;inject&#39; the VR into the game.</p> <p>So while we can reasonably expect native-VR titles to not benefit from the new 50-series-exclusive DLSS4 Multi-Frame-Generation feature, what does everyone think about UEVR titles?
