Performance: I need decent CPU and RAM to handle tools like Nmap, Sublist3r, and Burp Suite. 3. Privacy: A VPS provider that respects user data and has good security practices. 4. Bandwidth: Scanning can get bandwidth-heavy, so a reasonable data cap or unlimited traffic would be ideal.</p> <p>I\u2019ve considered options like DigitalOcean, Linode, and AWS Lightsail, but I\u2019m curious about what others here use and recommend.
