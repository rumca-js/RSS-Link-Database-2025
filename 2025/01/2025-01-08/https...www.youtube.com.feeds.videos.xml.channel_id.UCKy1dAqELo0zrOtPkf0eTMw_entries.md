In today's Daily Fix:
Accessories maker Genki showed off upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 accessories at this year's CES. But it wasn't the accessories that have the internet buzzing—Genki has a mock-up of the Switch 2 that, according to them, is based on the real dimensions of the not-yet-announced console. This is just the latest in a deluge of recent leaks surrounding the Switch 2, so hopefully Nintendo makes an official announcement soon. In other news, Game Pass games for January have been announced, with fighting games, cozy farm games, and demon-slaying games in the line-up.

Presented by Goosebumps: The Vanishing - Streaming this Friday on Disney+ & on Hulu until 4/9/25!

HBO has just given us a brand new look at The Last of Us Season 2, which will be arriving on our television screens in April of this year. It’s only a short teaser trailer, clocking in at just under a minute, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any shots, scenes, and characters that are worth taking a closer look at.

In case you missed the new Last of Us Season 2 trailer, watch the full video for the five new details we found from the show as well as comparisons between TLOU series and Naughty Dog’s original game that we’ve picked out from the brand-new trailer.

In this snippet from Podcast Beyond 878, it seems like Sony announced basically everything except games at this years CES, from feature film adaptations of Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers 2 to a Ghost of Tsushima anime series to an immersive and probably weird-smelling experience in The Last of Us. We break down why this new way to smell and immerse yourself in the world of The Last of Us (which is totally the world you definitely want to smell) is a pretty cool idea, even if it's most likely never going to be something anyone can just buy and install in their living room any time soon.

This week’s show is Max Scoville, Jada Griffin, Akeem Lawanson, Brian Altano, and is produced by Nick Maillet.
