<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>An acquaintance of mine is big into the cybersecurity world. I asked him how I could learn such things, he pointed me in the direction of CTF websites such as ringzer0 and wechalls, both of which rely on you having the knowledge to know how to complete the given tasks. Ive tried THM, which has just given me a foundation without any knowledge of how to use tools in the ways I need to complete other sites CTF challenges (THM free version). Where can I learn the information I need in order to attempt the CTF websites without cheating? Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Inspection5505"> /u/No-Inspection5505 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hw7y3c/knowledge_for_ctfs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hw7y3c/knowledge_for_ctfs/">[comments]</a></span>
