<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sometimes, a book isn’t just about its story or characters; it’s about the <em>vibe</em>. Have you ever read something that felt like autumn in a small town, the thrill of first love, or the quiet loneliness of a rainy evening?</p> <p>For me, it’s ‘The Secret History’ by Donna Tartt. The whole book feels like cold New England mornings, ancient libraries, and the creeping unease of secrets too big to hold.</p> <p>What’s a book that nails a mood or feeling so perfectly, you can almost taste it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Karolve3O"> /u/Karolve3O </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hwwp6y/books_that_perfectly_capture_a_specific_mood_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hwwp6y/books_that_perfectly_capture_a_specific_mood_or/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wanted to read this book. That&#39;s all. </p> <p>In the story, Raoul meets his beloved Kristina, whom he has not seen for several years, at the opera house and wants to meet her, but he finds out that she is talking to some kind of &quot;Angel&quot;, or is it the Phantom of the Opera, who terrorizes the theater? </p> <p>If you&#39;ve watched the musical, then you know that it pays a lot of attention to the relationship between Kristina and the Phantom. But the book is a thriller in which the Phantom of the Opera himself is a mystery figure to the reader as well. The author holds the tension quite well. But a couple of questions remain. <span class="md-spoiler-text">Why did the usher know the Ghost, and why does he have mystical powers?</span></p> <p>Of the characters, I would like to discuss the Phantom of the Opera himself. <span class="md-spoiler-text">I hate him.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Every book lately seems to be grumpy x sunshine or enemies to lovers but what do you feel are underrated book tropes that don&#39;t get talked about much but when they&#39;re done we&#39;ll make for a good story? One I can think of is properly morally grey characters that are a bit unlikeable because of their &quot;evil&quot; decisions. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever found a book that does morally grey well so many books just use quests for revenge as the bad part of the character but that doesn&#39;t really feel truly morally grey.</p> <p>I want to see more characters that do have moments of being selfish or mean without some good motive behind it. It gives more opportunity for making complex characters that are both good and bad instead of being one or the other.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CaptainMacAlfie"> /u/CaptainMacAlfie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comm

It seems like a conscious decision by publishers but it creates an unfinished look and it&#39;s so unsatisfying. </p> <p>Also matte covers which get stained by oil prints from your hands. The matte finish looks beautiful but it feels so guilty to handle the book. </p> <p>And maybe this is just me but when covers have a grainy texture they feel very odd to hold. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PolicyStunning7285"> /u/PolicyStunning7285 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hwf179/what_are_your_irrational_book_pet_peeves/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hwf179/what_are_your_irrational_book_pet_peeves/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had just seriously read A Christmas Carol for the first time, and noticed something that no one ever mentions about it so far as I’m aware. Dickens leaves it ambiguous as to whether Scrooge actually was visited by spirits, or if it was just a nightmare.</p> <p>So, when the men come to collect for the needy, Scrooge is struck by the realization that Marley had died 7 years prior to that very day, suggesting that he hadn’t really thought about it, or Marley, for a long time. Then, when he arrives at his home, he sees Marley’s face in the door knocker, which Scrooge notes is normally a completely ordinary knocker with no ornamentation to it. Then, at the end of the story, as he’s leaving his home, he looks at the door knocker and notes that it’s a face with an “honest expression,” and he’d never really noticed it before.</p> <p>Basically, my interpretation is that Scrooge was thinking about Marley because of his conversation with the charity men earli

That plus his main field of work being in medicine I figured that any follow up was going to take a while.
