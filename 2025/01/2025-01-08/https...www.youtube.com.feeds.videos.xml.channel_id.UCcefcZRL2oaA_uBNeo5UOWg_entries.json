        "description": "Two-time founder Rujul Zaparde knows a thing or two about resilience and learning from failure. After dropping out of college to build FlightCar, the AirBnB of car-sharing, he pivoted to become a product manager at Airbnb, and later a visiting partner at YC. In 2020, he co-founded Zip, a procurement software company that has since raised $370 million and reached a $2.2 billion valuation. In this conversation with managing partner Dalton Caldwell, Rujul demystifies the world of enterprise sales, shares his hard-earned lessons about scaling a business from zero and explains how founders can use first-principles thinking to better approach the challenges of building a startup.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://ycombinator.com/apply\n\nChapters (Powered by https://bit.ly/chapterme-yc) -\n00:00 - Intro\n01:45 - FlightCar\n10:00 - Airbnb\n14:30 - YC partner\n15:36 - Second startup\n18:16 - Sales\n20:30 - Pricing\n22:15 - Framework",
