## Scientists uncover key step in how diazotrophs 'fix' nitrogen

Nitrogen is an essential component in the production of amino acids and nucleic acids—both necessary for cell growth and function. Although the atmosphere is composed of nearly 80% nitrogen, this nitrogen is in the form of dinitrogen (N2), which cannot be processed by most organisms. Atmospheric nitrogen must first be converted, or "fixed," into a form that can be used by plants, often as ammonia.

In living animals, we can simply observe what they feed on today. In the case of extinct species, however, researchers rely on morphological or chemical information supplied by fossils.
