<p>The new version of Oracle’s Exadata platform, X11M, is now generally available, and promises improved performance on generative AI tasks such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for the same price as the old version.</p>



<p>Exadata is Oracle’s hardware and software platform for running Oracle Database workloads on premises or in hybrid- and multi-cloud environments. The previous version, X10M, was released in June 2023, just as demand for generative AI was taking off, and some of the changes in the latest version address the needs of that market.</p>



<p>“The improvements inside X11M that support handling vector indexes faster at scale will help enterprises take on more demanding and c

<p>The survey gathered input from more than 1,000 enterprise developers in the US, who enumerated the challenges they face in creating generative AIapplications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3603580/kotlin-for-java-developers.html">Kotlin</a> is a modern general-purpose language that brings together object-oriented and functional programming power in a sleek syntax. Ktor is the official HTTP server for Kotlin, leveraging Kotlin’s expressiveness for building endpoints and other server-side necessities.</p>

<p>The C programming language has been alive and kicking since 1972, and it still reigns as one of the essential building blocks of our software-studded world. But what about the dozens of newer languages that have emerged over the last few decades? Some were explicitly designed to challenge C’s dominance, while others chip away at it as a byproduct of their own popularity.</p>



<p>It’s hard to beat C for performance, bare-metal compatibility, and ubiquity. Still, it’s worth seeing how it stacks up against some of the big-name language competition.</p>
