I never use these devices outside my home, and these devices are always connected with the same Wi-Fi network. </p> <p>Previously, I tried to update those apps from the Aurora Store, and it showed an error. Then, I had to reinstall those apps from the Play Store in order to use them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/night_movers"> /u/night_movers </a> <br/> <span><a href="https:/
