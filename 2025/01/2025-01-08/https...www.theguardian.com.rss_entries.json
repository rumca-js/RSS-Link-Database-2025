There were 77 minutes on the clock, this Carabao Cup semi-final had finally started to bubble and Dominic Solanke thought he had put Spurs in front. It was not only a fine finish from Pedro Porro\u2019s searching through-ball but a goal of rich narrative possibility. This was a striker, remember, who had not enjoyed himself at Liverpool earlier in his career.</p><p>Enter the referee, Stuart Attwell, to explain, live and miked up, that Solanke had been offside. Attwell even blew his whistle into his microphone, which was a bit jarring. And yet there would be a twist. A glorious one in Spurs\u2019s eyes, one to fire the dream of a first trophy since 2008. And one to have Liverpool raging. Lucas Bergvall, the precociously talented Spurs midfielder, ought to have been sent off for cleaning out Kostas Tsimikas. He was already on a yellow card.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/08/spurs-liverpool-",

They implicitly believe that others should do that cognitive work for them while they shuffle along scrolling for porn or doom. If, however, a normal person bumps into them they will be enraged at the unpleasant reminder that other human beings exist outside their solipsistic bubble.

Each chapter title is a kind of inquiry: Did You See That?; Can You Feel That?; Can I Tell You Something? It\u2019s a simple device, but it creates an atmosphere of interrogative uncertainty I last felt when reading Carol Shields\u2019s Unless, a book in which adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions serve as chapter headings: Therefore; Instead; Despite. The isolated events that make up a life are connected less by tight plot lines than by little fragments of language and the hunger for connection they represent.</p><p>Sestanovich is a gifted writer when it comes to capturing appetites.
