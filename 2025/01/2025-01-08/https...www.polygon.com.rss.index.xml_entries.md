The game starts with sending the gang back to the ’90s before jumping straight into the action: flipping and fighting their way through waves of putty patrollers deployed by iconic villain Rita Repulsa. The rangers — or ranger, if you’re playing alone — fight their way through a sandy valley and across some rooftops before getting on a speeder and blasting away bad guys
