<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a tech interview tomorrow (first after two years) for middle full-stack and I&#39;m incredibly anxious due to my unsuccessful previous experience (ADHD makes it worse and I don&#39;t even have strength left to panic). I prepared as much as I could for most popular questions I could find. But I still recall the experience of last interview and I&#39;m afraid to be embarrassed again. So, wish me luck ðŸ˜… If you have some kind words or advice, I could really use some) Thank you all and wish you the best!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iForaminifera"> /u/iForaminifera </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hwy55g/wish_me_luck/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hwy55g/wish_me_luck/">[comments]</a></span>
