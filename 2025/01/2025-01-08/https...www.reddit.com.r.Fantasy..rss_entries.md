<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have seen this recommended so often. I know its a popular series in fantasy and I have had it on my TBR forever. But I honestly am beyond overwhelmed by the amount of books in this series (world?) lol.</p> <p>I know some general things about it but can anyone give me some reasons you love the series? a certain character, great plot, worldbuilding, character development, themes?</p> <p>or even things you do not like about them?</p> <p>I know I can look into this myself but I find it is hard to not come across spoilers when you start getting deep into searching a series.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this is a sort of specific request but I hope you can help me.</p> <p>I am looking for books with some nasty/brutal and mature plot around dragons &amp; dragonriders. I don&#39;t want a &quot;good-boy&quot; MC with a tame dragon - I want something meaner and darker. (think of dragons from ASOIAF as an example). About the dragons: they can be &quot;sentient&quot;, talk telepathically and have a &quot;bond&quot; with the dragonrider or be more like normal animals and used for combat etc; both options are valid. But they need to interact/live with humans (or serve them) - I don&#39;t need dragons that live by themselves and don&#39;t interact with humans. Dragonshifters are valid as well. The quantity of dragons doesn’t matter - it can be 1 dragon or 100. </p> <p>Again those are only my ideas since I haven’t read many books about dragons, so feel free to add more to the table. But it has to be adult fantasy with at least a few morally grey charac

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Thank you to NetGalley and St Martin’s Press for the e-copy in exchange for review!</p> <p>*</p> <p>I think your level of like for <strong>Breath of the Dragon</strong> will depend on what you like in a story. For me, I love martial arts movies, and lately there have been some great fantasy books based around tournament style fighting (like Combat Codes) so I was thrilled to see more in that genre of fantasy.</p> <p><strong>Breath of the Dragon</strong> definitely hit a lot of my like buttons with the fight structure, and a main character in Jun who is a great fighter but not necessarily the ‘chosen one’ but who over time becomes a bit of a symbol for the people. I also quite liked the fun side-characters, the martial schools and the great martial names.</p> <p><strong>The story</strong> in Breath of the Dragon opens up well; building the world and its conflicts into something that feels rich and fully realized. It’s nicely balanced between the polit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s talk about magic swords in fantasy literature. You know the ones - the legendary blades that glow in the presence of evil, were forged in dragon&#39;s breath, or contain the soul of an ancient hero. From Excalibur to Narsil, from Stormbringer to the Sword of Truth, these weapons have become almost mandatory in epic fantasy.</p> <p>But I&#39;ve been wondering lately: have magic swords become a crutch for fantasy writers? Don&#39;t get me wrong - I love a good enchanted blade as much as the next reader. There&#39;s something undeniably compelling about a hero drawing a mythical sword from its scabbard at just the right moment. But I&#39;m starting to feel like every other fantasy novel I pick up features some variation of the &quot;chosen one finds the legendary sword&quot; plot.</p> <p>Some thoughts to consider:</p> <p>What makes a magic sword story feel fresh versus derivative?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished this book (this isn’t meant to be a review but I loved it), and I don’t really get where this reputation came from? I knew going in that this book (and series) were a bit polarizing, and one of the most common complaints I saw was that it was really confusing and people weren’t sure wtf was going on for most of it. </p> <p>But honestly I felt like Gideon was pretty straightforward? Sure not everything was explained and the terms being thrown around weren’t clearly defined, but this didn’t feel out of the norm when compared to other fantasy books. The plot itself was clear, and even at times predictable (there’s a specific mystery where the hidden antagonist was relatively obvious, not a bad thing though). The world and magic system are not fully explained but I thought there was more than enough to go off of while leaving some mystery for future books. I don’t think it needed to be an Allomancy style hard magic system explained straig

It&#39;s Modern Day San Francisco with magic and all the fantasy tropes, but with smart phones and semiautos along side spell tomes and swords. Something like that.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There was this book that I found in my old elementary library that was set in the medieval era.</p> <p>From what I can remember It started with the main protagonist getting ready for some kind of status ceremony where a skin carver, (I think that&#39;s what they were called) carves a design into the arm of a child when they come of age that comes in numbers 1-11, I don&#39;t remember what 1-10 meant, just that 0 meant that they could be sensed by some kind of hunter and marked for execution. The protag gets marked 0 and is shown mercy by the skin carver who gives them food and enough coin for a few nights at an inn.</p> <p>I also think it had &quot;Dragon&quot; in its name</p> <p>That&#39;s all I can remember since its been nearly 12 years since I last read the book, any ideas on what it may be are appreciated. </p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hellocancer4"> /u/hellocancer4 </a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m finally reading <em>Tigana</em> by Guy Gavriel Kay, and I&#39;m kicking myself for not moving it higher up on my To Be Read list. The prose is gorgeous, the characters are fairly complex and compelling, and the world feels incredibly rich and lived-in. Several scenes have already moved me to tears (I do cry easy though...)</p> <p>Coming off of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s <em>Wind and Truth</em> (I&#39;m suddenly realizing both Stormlight Archive and Brandon Sanderson have not so good abbreviations) and the latest <em>Murderbot Diaries</em> novella, the shift in writing style is certainly noticeable. Kay&#39;s prose feels far more purple, which I&#39;m really enjoying. </p> <p>I&#39;m only partway through, but I&#39;m completely hooked. If the ending is as strong as the rest of the book, I&#39;m definitely going to be diving into more of GGK&#39;s work next. Any recommendations from fellow fans?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I picked up the coldfire trilogy recently and am about halfway through Black Sun Rising. So far I&#39;m enjoying most of it, but there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s been bothering me a bit.<br/> I absolutely love the lore and atmosphere of the setting. It feel so unique and just makes my imagination go crazy with how the world works. I love the mixture of fantasy and scifi it has with Erna being originally an earth colony turned medieval fantasy by some calamity.</p> <p>That being said, I can&#39;t help but feel a little disappointed by the characters and the main plot. At first they seemed interesting enough, if a bit generic, but after Ciani is attacked and her memories are stolen the plot basically seemed to devolve into a standard &quot;I want revenge&quot; quest. That by itself is fine, I just feel like there wasn&#39;t enough time for me to get to know the characters before that happened for me to care about their revenge. Damien and Ciani lost th
