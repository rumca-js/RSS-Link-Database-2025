AMD announced that its hotly anticipated Ryzen Z2 processor is ready to rock after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I6713BI1Bk\">first revealing the chip at Computex</a> last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD\u2019s initial Z1 chip powered most of the first wave of gaming handhelds, while Valve\u2019s Steam Deck uses a close custom-made sibling. AMD says the Z2 can provide \u201cconsole-class\u201d graphics that last for hours and hours, though it didn\u2019t disclose any benchmarks or deeper performance context. (To be fair, that\u2019s difficult since the design limitations of handhelds can drastically affect performance.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-",

Samsung, LG, Asus, MSI, Acer, and HP (among others) all came to the show with <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/811315/best-monitors-2.html\">fresh monitors</a> that push resolution and refresh rates to new heights. OLED once again stole the show, thanks to new 5K2K ultrawides and 4K 27-inch widescreens. But the show also brought new 6K options for content creators and an oddball 27-inch portable monitor from LG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the best monitors at CES 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lg-ultragear-45gx990a\">LG UltraGear 45GX990A</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"uploadedSrc\":false,\"figureClassNames\":\"wp-block-image size-large\",\"figureStyles\":null,\"imgClassNames\":\"wp-image-2570767\",\"imgStyles\":null,\"targetWidth\":\"none\",\"targe",
