Now I have one again. And it&#39;s amazing how smooth the scrolling is compared to scart on my modern (ish) LCD tv. I always remembered it being better on a crt, and it is. So happy to get another Philips CM8833 mk2 üòÅ. Also my gaming performance is better on this. Not sure if that&#39;s me, or if there was a lag issue on the lcd.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fatteragnus8375"> /u/fatteragnus8375 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/3p3qwflvjube1.jpeg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hwwzkg/cm8833_mk2_vibes/">[co

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I currently have AmigaOS 3.2 Install floppy + CD but for some reason the install disk is not recognized (Either the floppy is damaged or my drive needs some cleaning (not been used in like 7 years) </p> <p>Does anyone have the install set as ADF so I could use my GoTek instead? I already have the original ROMS (both 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.) </p> <p>I was hoping I could read the CD on my Mac but I failed - might be my old USB CD that also have stopped working.

## Kickstart 2 on an amiga 500 not plus?.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found a disk image of one of the amiga format disks with disksalv on it, apparently a well known alternative to the infamous disk doctor, there is a problem, it only worked for me on a 500 plus onwards if looking from a stock configuration standpoint. If there are any good alternatives that do work with kickstart 1 then please let me know, otherwise how can I get kickstart 2 for amiga 500?. I heard the 1000 has the roms loading from disk and the 500 plus uses a disk to downgrade for compatibility so would it be possible to have a kickstart 2 disk for amiga 500?. I read that replacing the physical chips is somewhat easy, but that would have to be a last resort for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Bear_1980"> /u/Ok_Bear_1980 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hw727q/kickstart_2_on_an_amiga_500_not_plus/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.redd
