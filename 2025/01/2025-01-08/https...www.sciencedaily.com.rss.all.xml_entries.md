A good night's sleep does more than just help you feel rested--it might literally clear your mind. A new study shows how deep sleep may wash away waste buildup in the brain during waking hours, an essential process for maintaining brain health. The findings also offer insights into how sleep aids may disrupt the 'brainwashing' system, potentially affecting cognitive function in the long run.

## Human 'domainome' reveals root cause of heritable disease

Unstable proteins are the main drivers of many different heritable diseases, according to a new study, including genetic disorders responsible for the formation of cataracts, and different types of rare neurological, developmental and muscle-wasting diseases. Unstable proteins are more likely to misfold and degrade, causing them to stop working or accumulate in harmful amounts inside cells.

## Study sheds light on depression in community-dwelling older adults

## Scientists uncover key step in how diazotrophs 'fix' nitrogen

Nitrogen is an essential component in the production of amino acids and nucleic acids -- both necessary for cell growth and function. Atmospheric nitrogen must first be converted, or 'fixed,' into a form that can be used by plants, often as ammonia. There are only two ways of fixing nitrogen, one industrial and one biological.

A new study reveals that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help expedite the search for solutions to reduce enteric methane emissions caused by cows in animal agriculture, which accounts for about 33 percent of U.S. agriculture and 3 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

## Researchers unravel a novel mechanism regulating gene expression in the brain that could guide solutions to circadian and other disorders
