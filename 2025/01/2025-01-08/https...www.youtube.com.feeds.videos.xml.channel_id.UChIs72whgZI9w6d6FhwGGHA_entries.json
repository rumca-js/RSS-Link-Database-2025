What we do know is that it's a test platform and a prototype, with both the most unique PCB we've ever seen for a video card and the most unique and complicated air cooling solution. This card goes for a total flow-through area, similar to what we're seeing on the NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition that was announced a few days ago, with a release date January 30, 2025.
