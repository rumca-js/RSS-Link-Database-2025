<p>Our new sanctions regime targets those profiting from irregular migration and organised immigration crime. We must be focused and smart</p><p>In January 1946, the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, stared into the geopolitical fog. The second world war had only just ended. The cold war, which would last more than four decades, was only just beginning. It was hard to see six months, let alone six years ahead.</p><p>But Bevin did not sit waiting for the fog to clear. He was a minister of action, who saw that what matters is not just what Britain says, but what it does. What matters is not just what Britain wants, but what it builds. What matters is having a strategy.

<p>Tottenham feared it was going to be a story about a fresh take on VAR pain. There were 77 minutes on the clock, this Carabao Cup semi-final had finally started to bubble and Dominic Solanke thought he had put Spurs in front. It was not only a fine finish from Pedro Porro’s searching through-ball but a goal of rich narrative possibility. This was a striker, remember, who had not enjoyed himself at Liverpool earlier in his career.</p><p>Enter the referee, Stuart Attwell, to explain, live and miked up, that Solanke had been offside. Attwell even blew his whistle into his microphone, which was a bit jarring. And yet there would be a twist. A glorious one in Spurs’s eyes, one to fire the dream of a first trophy since 2008. And one to have Liverpool raging. Lucas Bergvall, the precociously talented Spurs midfielder, ought to have been sent off for cleaning out Kostas Tsimikas. He was already on a yellow card.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/08/spurs-liverpool-

<p>A preposterous plot and terrible dialogue make for a deeply uninspired detective drama. Its nuance-free take on neurodivergence is embarrassingly clunky</p><p>Welcome to your first odd-couple detective drama of 2025. Patience is an adaptation by Matt Baker (Hotel Portofino, Before We Die) of Franco-Belgian creation Astrid et Raphaëlle. It’s about the evolving partnership between a young autistic cataloguer of police evidence (here named Patience and played by Ella Maisy Purvis), and dedicated older detective Bea Metcalf (Laura Fraser), who pulls her out of her comfort zone after recognising that Patience’s secret talents as a criminologist are being wasted in the bowels of the archive. She adds the unwilling young woman to her investigative team after Patience links the DCI’s current case – a man with apparently everything to live for, who self-immolates after withdrawing £8,000 from the bank and dropping it in a car park bin – with others that were dismissed as suicides but actua

<p>This cultural history of the British people is a vague, subjective take that lurches into the reactionary when it tackles social media. It’s a far cry from being a ‘major’ series</p><p>Simon Schama’s new show is, the BBC press blurb says, a “major” series, and it bears a grand and sweeping title, the Story of Us. One always wonders to whom such weighty first-person plurals refer – the answer here is the British people, in terms of how our postwar arts and culture have shaped who we are. But the picture of us is subjective, somewhat vague and limited to just three episodes. Major series are not what they used to be.</p><p>The timeline begins with the first cultural event Schama himself can remember, the 1951 Festival of Britain. It presented the country as forward-looking and dynamic, but the techno wonderland it set up on London’s South Bank was a temporary installation that the incoming Conservative government were happy to demolish – and, behind the dream of a bright manufacturi

<p>Grandad, Alan Sugar, a man I met in the pub: I’ve ignored them all. No wonder I don’t have any advice of my own to pass on</p><p>What’s the best bit of advice you’ve ever had? It’s a common question to lob in at the end of an interview. I mean the kind of interview you might be doing to promote a book or a film or something, rather than an interview for a job. Although I suppose it might crop up there too. I wouldn’t know, as I believe the last interview I had of that kind was for a job at the Birmingham Post in 1992. Not quite sure how I’ve managed to swerve all that stress ever since.</p><p>When I’ve asked the question of someone, on the radio, the interviewee has invariably been stuck for an answer. Now I see why. I’ve been asked it several times in recent months, at literary festivals and whatnot, talking about <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-curious-columns-of-adrian-chiles-9781805221814/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">a book

<p>‘I took all the images with a precisely tuned telescope then joined them up. Use the wrong type of telescope and you’ll blind yourself and burn your house down’</p><p>I bought a telescope on a whim in 2017, thinking back fondly to when my dad used to show me Jupiter and Saturn through his. I thought: “Why not revisit some of those memories, now that I can afford to spend a few hundred bucks on essentially a toy?” It was a 10in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope">Dobsonian telescope</a> that I set up in my back yard and pointed towards the brightest things I could see in the sky from the southern horizon – which by sheer luck happened to be Jupiter and Saturn.

Then I did what any millennial would do: I took out my iPhone and tried to take a photo of what I was seeing through the telescope. It didn’t turn out very good but it made me want to share what I was seeing with the

It revolves around a pair of children who were mistakenly swapped at birth, and the agony the subsequent discovery puts their parents through. It taps into a primal, gut-wrenching fear so profound that I know a lot of people – all parents, it must be said – who won’t even consider watching it.</p><p>I have to confess that I’m enjoying Playing Nice, especially the gleeful way it becomes quite self-consciously barmy. But for many others it is a step too far. Even the show’s star, Niamh Algar, acknowledged this in

But Kieran Culkin steals the show as the more mischievous cousin</p><p>With no great fanfare, Jesse Eisenberg has just given us a masterpiece. This is an effortlessly witty, fluent and astringent comedy with a very serious overcurrent. It is a road movie which is partly about the Holocaust and about America’s third-generation attempt at coming to terms with it, at confronting what their parents and grandparents found too painfully recent to revisit, or necessary to forget in order to survive. And partly it’s about family, male friendship and growing older. The movie affects a cool, sauntering tonal balance, teetering between the trivial and the world-historically important, with even the title glancing at the idea of someone being annoying … or experiencing authentic suffering.</p><p>As writer, director and joint lead actor, Eisenberg genero

If, however, a normal person bumps into them they will be enraged at the unpleasant reminder that other human beings exist outside their solipsistic bubble.

The deal means the fixture at Spa-Francorchamps – which is among the most recognisable circuits in F1 – will be omitted from the schedule in 2028 and 2030.</p><p>F1’s decision will free up room for new venues to be introduced – with Thailand, Argentina, Rwanda and a second race in Saudi Arabia all vying for spots on the schedule. It could also see the races in Imola and Barcelona’s Circuit de Catalunya rotated in the seasons to come. Both races are in danger, with a street round in Madrid due to be introduced next year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/08/spa-francorchamps-axed-from-f1-schedule-in-2028-and-2030">Continue reading...</a>

What can game do to stay afloat?</p><p>The water started flowing into the New Road practice area at about 4pm on Monday afternoon, and just kept on rolling. It flooded the entire ground and half the car park, as well as the nearby racecourse, the rowing club and the public footpath – which is now a popular hang-out space for swans. The head groundsman, Stephen Manfield, a man of a remarkably perky disposition, sits on the balcony of the club’s sports bar watching the fourth flood of the season do its business, the water coming in from the burst banks of the Severn as well as round the back across the fields. For the benefit of Spin readers he pokes his measuring stick into the water – “four-and-a-half feet in the shallow end” – and still rising.</p><p>Last off-season New Road was flooded eight times (enough for the chief executive, Ashley Giles, to question the long-term viability of the club

<p>Opposites attract in this subtle coming-of-age debut from an American author known for her short stories</p><p>Ask Me Again, the first novel by American short story writer Clare Sestanovich, is structured around a series of questions. Each chapter title is a kind of inquiry: Did You See That?; Can You Feel That?; Can I Tell You Something? It’s a simple device, but it creates an atmosphere of interrogative uncertainty I last felt when reading Carol Shields’s Unless, a book in which adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions serve as chapter headings: Therefore; Instead; Despite. The isolated events that make up a life are connected less by tight plot lines than by little fragments of language and the hunger for connection they represent.</p><p>Sestanovich is a gifted writer when it comes to capturing appetites.

You can either blame yourself or the other person, but it’s often a combination of the two - or something you each bring out in the other.

But as I looked at a tulip tree that day, my love of gardening came flooding back</p><p>I spent the early 00s living in my family home in west London, caring for my elderly father. When he died, in February 2015, I lost my home. When you’re on the streets, you have to sleep with one eye open in case people try to steal your things, so you end up being on alert 24 hours a day. The effect of living like that means you often look for distraction and I soon began spending time with other homeless people who were drinking and using drugs. I started smoking crack and heroin, and drinking heavily. My days all began to look the same: trying to stay warm, get into shelters, eat and score the next fix.</p><p>When Covid hit in early 2020, things became really hard – people were getting ill on the street and it felt sometimes as if we had been abandoned.

The brightly coloured, charmingly quirky toys fill floor-to-ceiling shelves in this Cambridgeshire garden centre, plastic eyes staring, stitched smiles beaming. There are plushly soft teddies and bunnies and cows and giraffes, but also boiled eggs in sunglasses and tennis balls with arms. Side by side they sit, a strange, soft communion, begging to be picked up and cuddled.</p><p>A closer look, though, reveals something less alluring. Every Jellycat has a grey security tag dangling from it, a pin piercing its downy fur. A scan of the ceiling shows security cameras trained on the shelves. When a member of staff walks past, I notice them glance apprehensively at me – and, I realise, at my tote

<p>Patience is Channel 4’s crime drama set in beautiful York. Plus: more trouble with Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors. Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><br>
 Patience (Ella Maisy Purvis) is an autistic woman who works in the criminal records department of Yorkshire police, but whose true talent is in criminology (self-taught since she was a child). When a series of apparent suicides are thought to be linked, detective Bea Metcalf (Laura Fraser) realises Patience is an asset to the case and asks for her help. But by the end of this slow-burn opener, we learn that one of the victims is familiar to Patience, and the story gets going. <strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/08/tv-tonight-a-new-detective-duo-investigate-a-string-of-suicides">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From opera singers to granola breakfasts, the reality TV smash hit sometimes feels like a Middle Englander’s fever dream. It’s only a matter of time before a task involves a dressage round</p><p>Out of the mouth of babes. Aged 20, Freddie Fraser might be the youngest player in The Traitors but he spoke an awkward truth about the hit BBC gameshow on the latest mission. Rowing a Viking longboat across a loch, Freddie sacrificed himself because he couldn’t get the knack. “I was struggling with the oar movement,” he admitted. “Like, I’m not that posh. I ain’t done rowing.”</p><p>Freddie made a fair point. Looking around at his shipmates, the politics student from Peterborough will have seen an interior designer, a business director, a doctor, a priest, a bank manager, two teachers and a retired opera singer. The interior designer, who took charge due to having the most rowing experience, happened to be named Francesca Rowan-Plowden. Not so much a cross-section of UK society as one of

<p>Professor of sociology <strong>Sam Friedman </strong>charts the enduring influence of private schools in the making of the British elite and asks whether the Labour government is looking finally to curtail it</p><p>The current Labour cabinet has been described as the most state-educated in British history: it’s not just Keir Starmer who went to a grammar school, all four holders of the great offices of state were state-educated.</p><p>It is, as LSE professor of sociology <strong>Sam Friedman </strong>explains, a marked departure from governments of the past – traditionally dominated not only by old public school boys, but by alumni of an even more exclusive circle. Two-thirds of the country’s prime ministers have come from so-called Clarendon schools – a group of nine of the most elite, prestigious, and expensive private boys’ schools in the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/jan/08/will-labour-take-on-the-power-of-private-schools-in-the-uk-podcast">
