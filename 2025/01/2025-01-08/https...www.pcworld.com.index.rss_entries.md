<p>Getting a new tablet is always exciting, and if you ask me, there’s still nothing quite better than an iPad. The performance is good, the experience is clean, and the value is fantastic.</p>



<p>And it’s even better when it’s on sale, which it is right now! For a limited time, the 10th-generation Apple iPad (the latest one, released in 2022) is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLXMVMV/">currently down to $279 on Amazon</a>, or 20 percent off its usual $349.</p>



<p>This 10.9-inch tablet is gorgeous, with a beautiful Liquid Retina Display, a solid build, and multiple color options. Seriously, its 2360×1640 resolution delivers crisp images and a wonderfully premium experience. Under the hood, it has an A14 Bionic chip that’s speedy enough to handle all sorts of tasks, games, and media streaming. It’ll last up to 10 ho

## Crucial’s new PCIE5 SSD sips power to save battery

<p>How fast do you need your PC’s storage to be? If the answer is always “faster” (even if you don’t actually need that speed for gaming), you might want to check out Crucial’s latest PCIE 5 drive. The P510 that just debuted at CES is claiming read speeds of up to 11,000 megabytes per second, with 9,550 on the write side of things. </p>



<p>That’s incredibly fast, but it isn’t quite speedy enough to beat the fastest PCIE 5 drive we’ve tested. That would be Crucial’s own T705 drive, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2229982/crucial-t705-ssd-review.html">unbeaten after almost a year</a>. </p>



<p>But the interesting twist here is that Crucial claims the P510 drive can do this using 25 percent less power than its previous fifth-gen designs. And that is indeed a big deal if you’re putting this thing in a laptop, where every watt counts in terms of batt

## Ventiva’s fanless PC cooler wins Intel over

<p>Around Christmas time, Ventiva launched its Ionic Cooling Engine (ICE), the latest in what has been an unexpectedly disappointing industry of fanless cooling solutions for laptops. But with Ventiva, there’s a key difference: It has a customer.</p>



<p>Ventiva, Intel, and Dell have collaborated on a proof-of-concept laptop that the company is showing off here at the CES show in Las Vegas. Inside is Ventiva’s ICE, which uses electrohydrodynamic airflow to strip about 25 watts’ worth of heat from a Core Ultra 200 (Lunar Lake) laptop — and essentially silently, to boot.</p>



<p>To be fair, Dell hasn’t formally committed to shipping the unnamed laptop, though it casually placed Ventiva’s name on its concept laptop, something that you don’t often see. Intel even endorsed the technology in its CES materials.</p>

## Interview: Valve talks SteamOS on third-party handhelds

<p>The Steam Deck has been the biggest PC gaming hardware story of the last few years. So it’s no surprise that the idea of running SteamOS (perhaps the most celebrated component of that machine) <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2567576/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-non-valve-steamos-gaming-handheld.html">on other handhelds like the Legion Go S</a> is also a big deal. On the show floor of CES 2025, PCWorld’s Adam Patrick Murray cornered Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais to chat about the future of Steam. </p>



<p>The Legion Go S will be the first non-Valve handheld with an officially blessed build of the Linux-based SteamOS available to buy directly from the manufacturer, alongside a version running Windows 11 that’ll be released sooner at a higher price. Griffais says that Valve is excited to work with companies like Lenovo (among others, <a hr

<p>Tech companies usually fall over each other to get the latest and greatest input and output ports into their devices in time for CES, but CES 2025 hasn’t yielded many Thunderbolt 5 devices.</p>



<p>One company that has taken the leap, however, is LG, who showed off the LG UltraFine 6K display with Thunderbolt 5 ports in Las Vegas this week. The LG UltraFine 6K is an interesting choice to place the world’s most capable consumer I/O connectivity, capable of outputting to double 8K displays at 60Hz or a single 6K display at 120Hz.</p>



<p>Okay, yes, the UltraFine 6K does boast an attractive 32-inch frame with super-slim bezels plus a 6K resolution, but LG made it a Nano IPS Black panel with a 98 percent DCI-P3 color gamut, not OLED. That means its color accuracy isn’t as good, and its blacks won’t quite reach the magnificent deep blacks gamers get from OL

## Why Asus’ world-first Thunderbolt 5 eGPU is on my gamer wishlist

<p>Asus just completely sold me on mobile GPUs by dropping the world’s first eGPU and dock with Thunderbolt 5 connectivity at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. Spoiler alert: It’s ripped with power and stacked with ports.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/external-graphic-docks/rog-xg-mobile-2025/">Asus ROG XG Mobile (2025)</a>, which looks a bit like a mini PC, can harness the power of up to Nvidia’s vanguard-tier RTX 5090 chip through a single cable connection. But it can do a lot more than that, too. The compact dock, which weighs less than 2.2 pounds, also provides up to 150W maximum power, supports dual monitors via HDMI 2.1 and USB DisplayPort 2.1, and throws in an SD card reader for fun — all the while providing a 5Gbps Ethernet connection.</p>



<p>The fact that it can do all that without self-destructing comes down to one thing: its Thunderbolt 5 con
