When I was looking for something I found it‚Äôs a lot of mixed genre with higher fantasy or particularly more romance mixed in with it which isn‚Äôt really what I was thinking.</p> <p>I was thinking witches and magic in our world, not in a fantasy world. I don‚Äôt mind if there‚Äôs a good romance in it but I don‚Äôt want it to be a romance with witches and it has to be adult I really can‚Äôt get into YA. Doesn‚Äôt have to be but I like some creepy elements to sometimes </p> <p>So what are some of the best witchy fiction books like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Emotional-Sir6052"> /u/Emotional

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I just re-read Camus&#39; The Myth of Sisyphus and it&#39;s left me wanting to dive into something fictional yet philosophical. I only recently read Kafka&#39;s The Trial and Metamorphosis for the first time and really enjoyed how engaging yet thought provoking they were. Upon observing my own reading habits I&#39;ve realized that I tend to not read anything newer and would like to change that. I believe the last modern novels I consumed were &quot;Hell&quot; by Robert Ohlen Butler and &quot;Clown Girl&quot; by Monica Drake which were both farcical yet intriguing looks at life&#39;s meaning and coping with less than enjoyable existences. I currently have some Sartre, who I am pretty unfamiliar with, on deck to read if I can&#39;t find anything that fits this criteria. </p> <p>Anything that could be provided in this vein would be greatly appreciated.

Title says it all, I guess.</p> <p>Recently I&#39;ve observed and suffered a lot about seeing that I am constantly making myself unhappy by comparing myself to imaginary and unrealistic standards.</p> <p>That includes things like being unhappy about my relationship when I see other girls that are smarter, &quot;more striking&quot; (I know how objectifying this sounds); people who use less social media and are more calm about themselves and their future; seeing how I used to be more settled and on top of things vs. now where I am in more stress and distract myself with games, social media, and what not.</p> <p>And I am quite sure, upon reflection, that it&#39;s not actually about being unhappy about my state. Because I am.

Anything around a &quot;top 100 books of all time&quot; list or something would be ideal, especially if they are on Kindle Unlimited. Just want to dive in and knock off as many of the best books as possible, I don&#39;t want to miss out anymore!</p> <p>Some of my favorites: Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Into the Wild, Five People you meet in Heaven.

She‚Äôs said she‚Äôll try one if I find it, however. So, any suggestions for something nice that she can disappear into, that‚Äôs not too dense or heavy on world-building? Ideally, it should have a strong focus on characters and relationships, with maybe a touch of whimsy or magic to keep things interesting without overwhelming her.

I absolutely loved it. Now I don&#39;t feel like watching TV at all so I can finish the book. </p> <p>I have already ordered part two of the saga. I found a Canadian website which has a lot of novels under 15 dollars but I need to other minimum of 50 dollars worth for free delivery.</p> <p>Can you please recommend any fantasy books that are good. I really am enjoying reading and don&#39;t want to lose interest. </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div>
