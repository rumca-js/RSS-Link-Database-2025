My router (Asus) have this custom option to refresh dns (and Lets Encrypt SSL) so that any change from my ISP would reflect on the domain and its routing. In later times, of course Squarespace took over Googles domains and i ran that thing for a year and now it morphed into a different plan.</p> <p>So i&#39;m now looking into alternative solutions that could work similar to google (or squarespace) where traffic could be routed to my local machine.</p> <p>But what should i look for specifically?
