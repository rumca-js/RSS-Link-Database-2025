<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not super technical and I forgot a lot of what I did to create this mess but I&#39;m researching what I can delete etc rn, and I just realised I have two seperate sims games on my laptop. I thought my EA version was the one I cracked but mods only work if I put them in the Origin Games folder I have stored on my onedrive. Is this because I somehow linked the cracked version to the Origin Games folder? I&#39;m like 90% sure I put in the EA version. Can I delete either?</p> <p>Extra info,,, I got the original game when it still cost money, got like four packs, downloaded the rest. I always play offline and under anadius because I don&#39;t understand the online part and I don&#39;t care anyway since I just build stuff sometimes. I did (truthfully) say my game was partially legit in the whole installment process.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redmushrooms444"> /u/redmushrooms444 </a> <br/>

As many others I have been playing around with the idea of switching to a Linux distro. I feel like gaming on Linux is becoming more supported by the day, so i want to make the switch. </p> <p>In testing if everything would work as intended, i came across a pretty big obstacle. While i dont really own a lot of cracked games, i do rely on a DLC unlocker a lot. I tried getting Koalageddon 1 and 2 to work, which both didn&#39;t. It&#39;s as if my Steam installation isn&#39;t even being recognized. </p> <p>I&#39;m hoping to find people who have managed to get it to work on a Linux distro, personally i went with CachyOS. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CaffeineAndKush99"> /u/CaffeineAndKush99 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hwwtus/unlocking_dlc_on_linux/">[link]</a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have google chrome extensions that I usually use to easily download onlyfans videos that seem to no longer be working on onlyfans for some reason. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because they&#39;ve made recent changes to their website code that has broken downloader extensions until they are updated to handle their new structure or not. But now when I try downloading the onlyfans videos with the current extensions I&#39;ve been using, I keep getting the &#39;Can&#39;t Play, The license for this content has expired. Please delete the file and download it again from your collection&#39; message when I try to open them in my movies &amp; TV video player on my windows 10 pro laptop. wonder if there&#39;s any way around this now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FollowingActual6088"> /u/FollowingActual6088 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hw7ovn/is_there_currently_
