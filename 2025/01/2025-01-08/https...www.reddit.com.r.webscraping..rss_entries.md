<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I&#39;ve built a web scraper (that was super difficult to do!) that scrapes eBay, Gumtree, and other marketplaces, etc. My friends and I have been using it to scrape these platforms and get custom details which we use for our reselling business. It&#39;s got to the point that I want to sell this as a service to other people as I know people who use it. I was wondering the legality behind it as I see lawsuits with these marketplaces and other scraping platforms and it all seems a grey area.</p> <p>can someone aid me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/smallroundcircle"> /u/smallroundcircle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hwtgmo/scraping_marketplaces/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hwtgmo/scraping_marketplaces/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all!</p> <p>I&#39;ve now done a couple of projects using Selenium for webscraping, and I&#39;ve realized that a lot of the syntax is super samey and tedious, and I can never quite remember all of the imports. SO, I&#39;ve been working on a github repothat makes scraping with Selenium easier, <a href="https://github.com/JoeyRussoniello/EasySelenium/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file">EasySelnium</a>! Just wanted to share with any folks newer to webscraping who want a slightly easier, less verbose module to perform webscraping with python.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Winter-Committee-945"> /u/Winter-Committee-945 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hwsy0s/easyselenium_for_python/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1hwsy0s/easyselenium_for_python/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all.</p> <p>I started collecting high-resolution images from museum websites. While most give them for free, some museums sold their souls to imagebanks who easily ask 80 bucks for a photo.</p> <p>For example the following;<br/> <a href="https://www.liechtensteincollections.at/en/collections-online/peasants-smoking-in-a-tavern#">https://www.liechtensteincollections.at/en/collections-online/peasants-smoking-in-a-tavern#</a></p> <p>This museum provides a zoomable image of high quality, but the downloadable images are NOT good quality at all.</p> <p>They use some zoom service called Micrio. I tried all the dev tools options I could find online but none seem to particularly work here.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to download these high-res zoom images from the webpage?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Molenaer_Fan"> /u/Molenaer_Fan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/we
