Two-time founder Rujul Zaparde knows a thing or two about resilience and learning from failure. After dropping out of college to build FlightCar, the AirBnB of car-sharing, he pivoted to become a product manager at Airbnb, and later a visiting partner at YC. In 2020, he co-founded Zip, a procurement software company that has since raised $370 million and reached a $2.2 billion valuation. In this conversation with managing partner Dalton Caldwell, Rujul demystifies the world of enterprise sales, shares his hard-earned lessons about scaling a business from zero and explains how founders can use first-principles thinking to better approach the challenges of building a startup.
