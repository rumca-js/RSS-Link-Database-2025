<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I drank the cool-aid on the Microsoft research that discouraged enforcing 90 day password rotation because users tend towards easy to guess simple passwords. Then the Lastpass breach happened. Then I learned about NTLM hash leakage, etc., etc., etc.</p> <p>So, considering that a lot of our systems do NOT have mitigating controls such as MFA, logging and alerting, anomaly detection, rate limiting, etc. Should I un-drink the cool-aid and bring back at least an annual password rotation requirement?</p> <p>We have people with nine year old Active Directory passwords. We have passwords on online accounts with the company name in the password with MFA off, etc.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PappaFrost"> /u/PappaFrost </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hwwh45/what_password_rotation_should_i_enforce_for_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="ht

Everything was going smoothly—until it wasn’t. He accidentally opened an Slack up right in the middle of the presentation. But there wasn’t just a harmless “lunch later?” message—it contained sensitive company information. The kind of stuff you <em>don’t</em> want your clients to see.</p> <p>The room went quiet. The client saw it, his manager saw it. That slip-up cost the company not just a deal— but also it cost him his job.

I didn&#39;t study cybersec in faculty, actually i have a bachelor&#39;s degree in electrical engineering and this summer i also plan to finish a master&#39;s degree in electical engineering too. Since i was like 5 years old i had a PC that i had used for anything, mostly gaming, but also studying and learning new things, but i never really dug more deeply in how computers really work besides maybe searching something on googe that i didn&#39;t know and i needed or something like that. I would say i have maybe an intermediate experience in using PCs and technology in general, i know how to do some tricks with them, but if you make me explain deeper things on how they work i would need to search about that.</p> <p>Now that i gave you some background my problem is: at this job which is incident reporting (IR) as a L1 SOC Analyst i see that you don&

Performance: I need decent CPU and RAM to handle tools like Nmap, Sublist3r, and Burp Suite. 3. Privacy: A VPS provider that respects user data and has good security practices. 4. Bandwidth: Scanning can get bandwidth-heavy, so a reasonable data cap or unlimited traffic would be ideal.</p> <p>I’ve considered options like DigitalOcean, Linode, and AWS Lightsail, but I’m curious about what others here use and recommend.

Does this mean something is running 24/7 to collect those logs?</p> <p>I&#39;ve yet to work at a place where all network traffic is being captured and logged 24/7 ( granted I mostly worked in medium sized enterprises). Are the labs just not very realistic in this regard, or do large enterprises actually capture and log all network traffic around the clock? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ensoens"> /u/ensoens </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hwctsf/network_pcap_capture_247/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hwctsf/network_pcap_capture_247/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Folks who joined a company after they just had a fairly large cyber incident (think millions of PII exposure). What has been the experience? </p> <p>I&#39;m particularly interested in the questions you asked during your interview and how you gauged their responses. Were they defensive/evasive? Did you regret the move after you started working there? If you eventually left, was the experience you gained in helping to clean-up valuable to your career or was it just another section on your resume?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p>Edit: Updated from &quot;Cybersecurity company&quot; to just &quot;Company&quot; (Financial, SaaS etc)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cyberdot14"> /u/cyberdot14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hwaprp/joining_a_company_after_security_incident/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comment
