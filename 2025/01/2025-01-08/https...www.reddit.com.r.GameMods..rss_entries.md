<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been slowly getting back into gaming this past year, starting with a Series X and Gamepass. I see myself eventually investing in &amp; building a quality gaming PC at some point. </p> <p>My question is this: will my entire game library purchased through Gamepass Ultimate be able to be modded on PC or will I have to purchase the games I want to mod again for PC? </p> <p>I have a decent collection going with all of the deeply discounted games I&#39;ve been seeing on sale and it would be really cool if these can be modded in the future. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/humanoid_42"> /u/humanoid_42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1hwnar5/can_gamepass_games_be_modded_on_pc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1hwnar5/can_gamepass_games_be_modded_on_pc/">[comments]</a></span>
