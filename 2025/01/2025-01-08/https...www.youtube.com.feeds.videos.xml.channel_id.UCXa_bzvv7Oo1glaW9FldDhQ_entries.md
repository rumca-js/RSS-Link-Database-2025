With reputable reports from Jez Corden, Kobrille, and NateDrake, rumors of a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake or remaster are all but confirmed for 2025. The game will likely be using Unreal Engine 5 for its graphics while the old Creation Engine manages the underlying physics and gameplay. 

It’s still a mystery whether this project overhauls prominent systems like a proper remake or if it’ll just be a cosmetic improvement and be a light remaster. That leaves the question: just what should be improved and/or kept for a re-rerelease of Oblivion?

2006’s Oblivion was revolutionary at the time for its radiant AI, physics, and open world. But things like the flawed levelling system and the dull combat make it hard for some gamers to return to today.

Sniper Elite: Resistance is the latest entry in developer Rebellion’s long-serving World War II themed stealth-come-military shooter.

There’s an element that Sniper Elite: Resistance is DLC for Sniper Elite 5 repackaged as a fully-fledged game, and whilst, yes, there isn’t a boatload of innovation here, Sniper Elite: Resistance does feature a handful of novel innovations which we’ll go through in this feature. The game’s out January 30th to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms, and it’s looking to do just enough to justify itself as a worthy entry in the storied series.
