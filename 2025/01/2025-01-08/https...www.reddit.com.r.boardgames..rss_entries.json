There was quite a lot of discussion around how although it was great, it wasn&#39;t a game for everyone and had some key weaknesses. Partly because of those complaints and also the steep price of the ultimate edition, I&#39;d held off on buying it for fear I might not like it. But recently I took the plunge after finding the ultimate edition on sale, and boy oh boy am I glad I did.

I&#39;ve got Bristol 1350 and want to try it with my group, but when I looked into rules in more details preparing to the game I realised that there is possibility to be contracted &quot;forever&quot; what will change your objective. In this regards two questions (to thouse who played the game):</p> <p>1) What is the motivation to avoid contraction &quot;at any cost&quot; as it&#39;s written in the rules. It seems that it&#39;s easier to win just contracting the plague right away. </p> <p>2) Also, if you are &quot;forever ill&quot; - it kind of devaluate the winning in general since many (seems) will win the game. </p> <p>So, my question - if any of you modified the rules somehow, so someone who get 6 just &quot;dies&quot; and out of the game? Or something else? </p> <p>Where are you finding fun in this game (if you do :) in general)</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cha",

We already chose the model, it will be a zeus from mesas para juegos. My only concern is about the size of the gaming area, which is by default 91x180cm. Which seems alright, but maybe 91 cm is a little short ? What are your opinion on this ? My favourite games are : Heat Ark Nova Spirit Island Terra Mystica Terraforming Mars</p> <p>On one hand 91cm might be enough and comfortable to reach most of the table, on another hand is it enough to play these games ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GDB_\"> /u/GDB_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hwk6tr/size_for_a_boardgame_table/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hwk6tr/size_for_a_boardgame_table/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;ve been playing Scythe for a year now with my family and a few friends and we love it. What we haven&#39;t loved is all the time it takes to setup and cleanup. So for about 6 months I&#39;ve been working on a storage system for Scythe. But not just the base game, of course, because what&#39;s the point of having a place for only some of the things? After countless hours and many iterations, the ultimate Scythe insert is finally finished! It accommodates every official Scythe product and promo item (except the neoprene mat and the World of Scythe art book). I&#39;ve super proud of how it turned out, and I&#39;d love to hear what everyone thinks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everybody,</p> <p>I have a question regarding Spacing guild expansion. Is this expansion really unbalanced and favors Harkonen? I read quite a few posts about this and I didn&#39;t quite get the answer I was hoping for. Some people say it favors Harkonen, other people say that Atreides can play around it too. Since this expansion costs quite a lot in Europe (49.90\u20ac) I want to make sure it is worth getting as I can get a new game like Arcs at similiar price point. So to anyone who has played the game with this expansion, does it improve the gameplay and is it worth spending the dime to get it?</p> <p>I really apreciate every response.
