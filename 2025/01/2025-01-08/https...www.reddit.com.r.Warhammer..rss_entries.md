<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wondering because I&#39;m a huge Halo fan which if you ignore all of the stuff 343i added like The Arbiter putting on a suit of immortal zombie armor or the Master Chief literally becoming the god of fortune and war, Halo has always been a rather grounded universe. In the game Halo Reach alone there&#39;s some good moments of &quot;huh, I never thought about that, but that makes sense.&quot; like how when The Grafton fires a MAC shot in atmosphere and Jorge is shocked that it&#39;s being done. It&#39;s because a MAC round is so powerful that when you fire it in atmosphere it disrupts alot of stuff on the surface of a planet causing massive gusts and often natural disasters. Also, when Reach was being glassed you can see the atmosphere leaving the planet because the ooze layers were literally burned away. <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/images/0/0c/Fall_of_Reach_1.jpg">Reach in the process of getting glassed.</a> Another thing I didn&#39;t think of
