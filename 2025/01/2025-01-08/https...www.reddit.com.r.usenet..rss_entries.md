<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;m currently running Newsdemon for 2,25 € per month (27€ per year) which is pretty good and finds way enough of my stuff but sometimes I also need an Indian or Turkish VPN for example for some buys. Newsdemon offers SlickVPN access but only to locations in USA, UK and Singapore.</p> <p>So I was wondering if this special Eweka deal with VPN included would support more locations or specifically regions like India. Or would you recommend me any cheap VPN service for this? I don&#39;t use VPN often. Only a few times a year. I know that Eweka is a better Usenet provider because of it&#39;s retention so the little higher price might be worth it anyway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CptDayDreamer"> /u/CptDayDreamer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hwnkmk/eweka_included_vpn/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im really new to easynews/usenet so sorry if this is a stupid question. I joined easynews for there $2 a month plan and it seems great for the price. Some shows i cant find using easy news but I can find with NZBgeek (currently using the trial but willing to pay). Is there a way I can download the nzb file for the show and then download using my easynews subscription using an ipad preferably?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NSS1989"> /u/NSS1989 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hwg0n2/nzbgeek_with_easynews/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hwg0n2/nzbgeek_with_easynews/">[comments]</a></span>
