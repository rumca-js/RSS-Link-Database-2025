I would love books with Black leads but I\u2019m open to all books with WOC as leads. I\u2019d love if these were written by authors of color but as they\u2019re free i understand if my stipulations are hard to meet. Still drop your recs, they\u2019re free so it can\u2019t hurt! No self help please. </p> <p>I\u2019m not asking for pirated books, I am asking for book recs that are labeled as FREE on the Apple Book Store. I\u2019m planning to get my library card so this is a quick fix until I get a bit of free time to do that!

My brain often comes up with more fascinating stories, and if I&#39;m not left on a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter, I&#39;ll likely never pick up the book again. Does anyone have any good book suggestions that are generally fast-paced and hard to put down? I generally enjoy fantasy and have enjoyed the Empyrean series. :) (For example, as a kid, I loved the Wings of Fire series because it always ended on a cliffhanger every chapter.

I feel like this is too niche of an ask and they might not even really exist but it\u2019s worth a try.

Title says it all, I guess.</p> <p>Recently I&#39;ve observed and suffered a lot about seeing that I am constantly making myself unhappy by comparing myself to imaginary and unrealistic standards.</p> <p>That includes things like being unhappy about my relationship when I see other girls that are smarter, &quot;more striking&quot; (I know how objectifying this sounds); people who use less social media and are more calm about themselves and their future; seeing how I used to be more settled and on top of things vs. now where I am in more stress and distract myself with games, social media, and what not.</p> <p>And I am quite sure, upon reflection, that it&#39;s not actually about being unhappy about my state. Because I am. But the constant unhappyness about wanting to be on the greener side of the grass (that probably doesn&#39;t exist in reality) makes me 1. unhappy and 2. puts me under a lot of stress which is the urge to improve my life.</p> <p",

I was a little disappointed in kindle unlimited&#39;s lack of selection (I am naive and thought buying a kindle with unlimited automatically gave me access to every book I want to read lol) My goal is to check off as many of the \u201cbest ever/must-reads\u201d as possible. Anything around a &quot;top 100 books of all time&quot; list or something would be ideal, especially if they are on Kindle Unlimited. Just want to dive in and knock off as many of the best books as possible, I don&#39;t want to miss out anymore!</p> <p>Some of my favorites: Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Into the Wild, Five People you meet in Heaven. Really interested in 11/22/63 by King. Also looking for some good books on productivity/skill development.

The thing is, she\u2019s convinced need she doesn\u2019t like fantasy, despite never having really engaged with it (her mental image of fantasy is The Lord of the Rings with all of its seriousness and funny names; we did read The Ten Thousand Doors of January together and she enjoyed that, so she\u2019s not completely against heightened fiction). She\u2019s said she\u2019ll try one if I find it, however. So, any suggestions for something nice that she can disappear into, that\u2019s not too dense or heavy on world-building? Ideally, it should have a strong focus on characters and relationships, with maybe a touch of whimsy or magic to keep things interesting without overwhelming her.
