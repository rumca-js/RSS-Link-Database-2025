If the answer is always \u201cfaster\u201d (even if you don\u2019t actually need that speed for gaming), you might want to check out Crucial\u2019s latest PCIE 5 drive. The P510 that just debuted at CES is claiming read speeds of up to 11,000 megabytes per second, with 9,550 on the write side of things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s incredibly fast, but it isn\u2019t quite speedy enough to beat the fastest PCIE 5 drive we\u2019ve tested. That would be Crucial\u2019s own T705 drive, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2229982/crucial-t705-ssd-review.html\">unbeaten after almost a year</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the interesting twist here is that Crucial claims the P510 drive can do this using 25 percent less power than its previous fifth-gen designs. And that is indeed a big deal if you\u2019re putting this thing in a laptop, where every watt counts in terms of batt",
