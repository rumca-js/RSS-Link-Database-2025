Maria broods over her “medication” and neglects to eat, and she is impossibly difficult with the servants, housekeeper Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher) and valet Ferruccio (Pierfrancesco Favino), who are the aghast witnesses to her decline – and she is beginning to relinquish the idea that she will ever sing again.
