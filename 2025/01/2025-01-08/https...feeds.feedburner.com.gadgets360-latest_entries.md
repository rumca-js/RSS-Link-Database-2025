Recent studies have highlighted the alarming effects of PFAS (forever chemicals) on freshwater turtles in Australia. The research, led by environmental biochemist David Beale and his team, discovered that PFAS exposure is causing serious health issues in both adult turtles and their hatchlings. The chemicals accumulate in key organs like the liver, kidneys, and ovaries, leading to metabolic disruptions and deformities in young turtles. The study also found a concerning absence of juvenile turtles in contaminated areas, suggesting that PFAS may be reducing turtle populations. Experts warn that these findings could indicate broader environmental risks from PFAS exposure

Jupiter’s clouds, long believed to be made of ammonia ice, are now confirmed to consist primarily of ammonium hydrosulfide combined with photochemical materials. This groundbreaking discovery, achieved through collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers, has redefined our understanding of the planet's atmosphere. Using innovative methods involving commercial telescopes and filters, researchers identified cloud layers deeper and warmer than previously thought. These findings also highlight the role of photochemical reactions in preventing ammonia condensation, influencing the planet's iconic colours and weather patterns. The study paves the way for simpler cloud-mapping techniques and reveals parallels with atmospheric processes on Saturn

As Antarctica’s ice sheet continues to melt, scientists warn it could awaken over 100 hidden volcanoes beneath the surface. The loss of ice reduces pressure on magma chambers, allowing the magma to expand and potentially trigger eruptions. This could lead to increased volcanic activity, releasing gases and heat that may accelerate ice melt, weakening the ice sheet's stability. These processes could initiate a feedback loop, amplifying climate change effects. This research underscores the complex relationship between global warming and geological activity, revealing significant implications for the planet’s future if subglacial eruptions become more frequent

A new theory proposes that Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, was formed billions of years ago through a rare "kiss-and-capture" collision in the Kuiper Belt. This process involves two icy bodies briefly merging and then separating, leaving Charon in a stable orbit around Pluto. Unlike traditional collision models, this event challenges previous theories and may offer insights into the formation of other large moons in the solar system. Researchers aim to explore the long-term tidal evolution of Charon to further validate this hypothesis

A detailed genetic analysis of Yemen has uncovered the region's complex migration history. By studying 46 Yemeni genomes, the research reveals significant genetic influences from East Africa, the Levant, and Arabia. Maternal DNA shows a marked African presence, with one-third of individuals carrying African-specific mitochondrial haplogroups, particularly L2a1, indicating a flow of genes from East Africa. Paternal DNA connects Yemeni populations to the Levant and Arabia, with the J1 haplogroup as a key marker. Coastal regions exhibit stronger African genetic influence than inland areas, which show closer ties to Arabia and the Levant. The findings underscore Yemen's role as a historical crossroads in trade and migration, particularly during the Bronze Age and the Red Sea slave trade
