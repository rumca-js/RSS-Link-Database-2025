That\u2019s true, in the case of actual beta\nsoftware, where by \u201cactual beta\u201d I mean \u201cnot yet released,\nbut close\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Released vs. not-released is the distinction that warrants\ncritical restraint. Film critics don\u2019t write reviews of rough\ncuts. Book critics don\u2019t review non-final manuscripts of novels.</p>\n\n<p>Released software that is labeled \u201cbeta\u201d is still released\nsoftware, and is fair game for the same level of criticism as any\nreleased software. You can\u2019t \u201csemi-release\u201d your 1.0 just because\nyou want it out there but aren\u2019t yet finished. Being semi-released\nis like being semi-pregnant.
