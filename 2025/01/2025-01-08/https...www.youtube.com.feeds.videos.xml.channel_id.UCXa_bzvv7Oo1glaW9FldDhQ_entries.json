        "description": "With reputable reports from Jez Corden, Kobrille, and NateDrake, rumors of a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake or remaster are all but confirmed for 2025. The game will likely be using Unreal Engine 5 for its graphics while the old Creation Engine manages the underlying physics and gameplay. \n\nIt\u2019s still a mystery whether this project overhauls prominent systems like a proper remake or if it\u2019ll just be a cosmetic improvement and be a light remaster. That leaves the question: just what should be improved and/or kept for a re-rerelease of Oblivion?\n\n2006\u2019s Oblivion was revolutionary at the time for its radiant AI, physics, and open world. But things like the flawed levelling system and the dull combat make it hard for some gamers to return to today.",

It\u2019ll plunge players once again during the latter stages of World War II, with new missions across newly designed territory the fodder to engage in the series\u2019 award-winning advanced sniping mechanics and tactical third-person gameplay. \n\nThere\u2019s an element that Sniper Elite: Resistance is DLC for Sniper Elite 5 repackaged as a fully-fledged game, and whilst, yes, there isn\u2019t a boatload of innovation here, Sniper Elite: Resistance does feature a handful of novel innovations which we\u2019ll go through in this feature. The game\u2019s out January 30th to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms, and it\u2019s looking to do just enough to justify itself as a worthy entry in the storied series.",
