I have my eyes on a future in corporate security/security architecture and it\u2019s apparent that the ability to automate plays a big role. </p> <p>I\u2019ve taken multiple Python courses and understand the basics but have had a difficult time of \u201cgetting into it\u201d per se. For those who have gone on a similar journey, how did you finally adopt an engineering mindset and begin being able to identify impactful projects? Working for such a large organization it\u2019s difficult to figure out how to apply what little coding knowledge I know and expand upon it.

It\u2019s not where my passion is. But I do want more cloud experience cause I want to move to a better paying job to be more marketable. I have Microsoft sc-200 as well since we currently use M365. </p> <p>I want a hands on blue team certification as well. BTL1 is what I want, then, eJPT, then CCD. I want to get better at the hands on blue team stuff, a red team cert to understand that side more. I feel like I\u2019m just flowing and not focused right now. Is this a good way to be more marketable or should I add more cloud certs/experience? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Glad_Pay_3541\"> /u/Glad_Pay_3541 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1iafd0g/whats_next_after_cissp/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

I recently built a SaaS called Barrion, used to help tech teams and security professionals to identify security issues in their websites and web apps. The service allows users to scan websites or really any deployed web application which is publicly accessible, such as portals, API&#39;s etc. There&#39;s support to run these scans on schedule, as well as to run instantly for a quick (almost instant) assessment. Each scan provides a summary with actionable insights about potential vulnerabilities.</p> <p>The service is currently completely free to use, including all pro features, as I\u2019m looking for feedback to improve it. Feel free to check it out and share your thoughts!</p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable-Buyer-119\"> /u/Remarkable-Buyer-119 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/com",
