<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I thought I was trans for 3 1/2 years. I asked people to call me by my chosen name and am still sort of known by that name by a couple of my friends.</p> <p>I didn’t do anything major except for the name and pronouns. I recently found out I’m just bi with a heavy preference for women and I’m a little bit of a masc. I want to tell people about my healing story with not being confident and not understand myself, and this is definitely a major part in it. But I have seen so many people talking like “we don’t care about you de-transition” and I feel like I would be disrespected to the trans community if I do talk about it. I have immense respect for the trans community and don’t want to be “putting them in the dark” by talking about it. Should I feel guilty for wanting to talk about my “de-transition” (if it is even called that in my case)?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/leahluvsrocks"> /u/leahluvsr
