Keegan brings 1980\u2019s Ireland to life through her writing, and even though it\u2019s such a simple story of kindness and how to be human is to be kind, it\u2019s still such an engrossing read. Furlong\u2019s daily life and musings were a joy to read too. I teared up a bit at the part where he first met the girl in the convent, and again towards the end where he rescued her from the convent. I couldn\u2019t put this book down after I finished reading the 4th chapter. It\u2019s well past midnight here but I knew I had to go all the way and finish it in one sitting, which I haven\u2019t done for a long, long time because of a chronic reading slump. Looking forward to reading more of Keegan\u2019s work after this.</p> <p>Okay enough rambling I guess, but yeah I highly recommend this short and moving story to anyone who\u2019s going through a reading slump, and to anyone who\u2019d like to emerge a little bit more optimistic after finishing it about o",

This is my first experience reading a novel written as a stream of consciousness, and I admit it was challenging. It was hard to find a natural pause in which to stop. Set in the fictional town of Macondo, the novel chronicles the Buend\u00eda family across seven generations, weaving a rich tapestry of love, ambition, and destiny. The novel&#39;s structure is both intricate and ingenious, as time spirals rather than flows linearly, with events and character traits echoing across generations. This cyclical nature is emphasized by the repetition of names, creating a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that permeates the narrative. <em>As a history enthusiast, I found this mirroring of historical patterns particularly engaging</em>.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez&#39;s use of magical realism creates a world where the strange seamlessly ming",
