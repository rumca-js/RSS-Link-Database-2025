<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I have spent a few hours trying to debug this and have had little success. I am using docker compose to host a plex server, where the files are located on an external drive mounted in <code>/mnt/data/media</code>. This system was working fine. However, I accidentally rebooted my pc. Unfortunately, the filesystem did not mount to this mountpoint (It wasn&#39;t specified to the fstab) and as a result of this I assume this is where the error came from. After this, I recieved various errors with plex [Please note, this whole post is not plex specific, and I did not have these problems beforehand - I have had errors of various kinds with other services since too]. (<code>docker logs plex</code>):</p> <pre><code>... chown: missing operand after ‚Äòplex:plex‚Äô Try &#39;chown --help&#39; for more information. ...

My goal is to use Docker as my development environment since it includes all the dependencies and libraries I need. I‚Äôve got VSCode connected to the container, which is great because I get autocomplete, reference lookups, and no errors for missing libraries (unlike working directly on my Mac).</p> <p>The issue I‚Äôm running into is this:</p> <ul> <li>Every time I make changes to the code and want to test it, I have to restart the container. When I do that, the VSCode connection dies, and I have to reconnect.</li> <li>If there‚Äôs a bug or crash in the Python app, the Docker container stops, and I lose access via VSCode.</li> </ul> <p>I‚Äôd like to have a setup where the Docker container stays up and running while I‚Äôm editing code, but I can start/stop/restart the app
