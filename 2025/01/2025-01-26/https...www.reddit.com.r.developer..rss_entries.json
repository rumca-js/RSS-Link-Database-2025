I&#39;m working on a project right now where essentially I will have a queue that reads off of a server and updates a graphic with the names in the queue, a kiosk where users can add themselves to the queue, and another client that will connect to manage the queue. I want the queue to be displayed on a tv, so I am thinking my implementation for the front end will be a raspberry pi zero W connected to it via HDMI and being powered by the TV&#39;s USB port. Is there some sort of better implementation that I am missing that would be a more practical method of attack?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TFGCards\"> /u/TFGCards </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1iahosa/raspberry_pi_frontend/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1iahosa/raspberry_pi_frontend/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Here&#39;s how it works:</p> <p>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Choose a skill you want to improve.<br/> 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Build a project from scratch in one month.<br/> 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Share weekly updates on your progress and get feedback.<br/> 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Compete for a chance to be featured on my new project: freelancing platform for developers.</p> <p>The idea is to help participants grow, connect with other coders, and showcase their work.</p> <p>Would you be interested in joining?
