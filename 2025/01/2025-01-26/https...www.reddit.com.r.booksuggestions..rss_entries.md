The reason she is an addict is due to her being in the car when her parents and the best friends parents die. They all find out it wasn’t an accident and they decide to take revenge on the person at the party announcing she is home. The FMC also ends up in a relationship with her bodyguard at some point in the story too. </p> <p>Some other stuff happened but that’s the main stuff I can remember. Also not sure where it was published as I read on a few different platforms. Tried googling it but no luck. Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </p> </div><!-

## What are the GOATs of audiobooks?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some audiobooks just fly straight past me, like James Joyce&#39;s Portrait, Wuthering Heights and Infinite Jest. Of course I loved them when I read them in text, brilliant books. </p> <p>I had the opposite experience with Les Miserables, War and Peace, and Count of Monte Cristo, as they seem to be written in a way where the audio form doesn&#39;t take too much away from them. Non fiction seems hit or miss in that regard too. </p> <p>So I guess I want really good audiobooks that have simple prose, and are executed well in terms of voice acting and quality.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAirplaneScene"> /u/TheAirplaneScene </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ia8w90/what_are_the_goats_of_audiobooks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ia8w90/what_are_the_goats_of_audiobooks/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for a book that makes me want to do nothing but read and try to get everyone else to read the book because I love it so much. I used to feel this all the time as a kid reading books like Twilight, Hunger Games, Pretty Little Liars, etc. I felt it with ACOTAR and Boys of Tommen as an adult, but I want more!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In ways the book communities on YouTube/TikTok/Instagram have helped me a lot. They’ve helped me stay motivated to read, get back in to reading and find out about many books I probably wouldn’t otherwise. I’ll often read my books with live reading sprint videos. But in other ways, I find them very frustrating. almost like they are a members only club where everyone is reading the same books. For example close to 80-90% of the people I follow are all reading “Onyx storm” They all usually have ACOTAR books in the background . I have nothing against the book itself or people who want to read them , I’m just giving an example of how everyone always seems to be reading the same things. What are your thoughts on these type of reading platforms? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jolly_Data_2412"> /u/Jolly_Data_2412 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ia3x7s/opinio
