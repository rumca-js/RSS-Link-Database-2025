Apologies if so.]</p> <p>As a developer that spends some time with AI during work hours, I wanted to create an assistant that would help me talk to my infrastructure/services using AI. The main idea is that it generates the command/query that I need based on the context that is set by the infrastructure that it is connected.</p> <p>As of now, I am using this CLI tool to connect to Kubernetes clusters, PostgreSQL database, and Azure and to get the commands that I normally need to google or find from the docs. It is fully open-source right now and I need some help if you are interested.</p> <p>Here’s how it works:</p> <ol> <li>You connect to your service with a simple command: <code>pops conn connect</code>.

First of all, the broligarchy did not understand, that natural language has certain limits, so LLMs cannot recreate the full scale of human cognitive capabilities. That was the original sin, the source of the belief, that ONLY GPUs will decide the AI race. In reality training based on hundreds of thousands of GPUs won&#39;t create AGI. So while the US LLMs plateaued in 2024 (the US wasn&#39;t able to use it&#39;s GPU supremacy), the Chinese used efficient methods to create SOTA LLMs with limited GPU resources.

The tech Cold War just went thermonuclear.</em></p> <p><strong>1. Trump’s TikTok &quot;Shakedown&quot;: A Public Humiliation?</strong><br/> Remember when Trump threatened to ban TikTok unless it sold a majority stake to U.S. entities, even asking Larry Ellison on live TV if he’d buy it &quot;cheap&quot; if China refused? This wasn’t just hardball negotiation—it was <em>theater</em>. For China, this likely crossed two red lines:<br/> - <strong>Economic</strong>: Forced asset transfers echo colonial-era &quot;unequal treaties,&quot; a sensitive historical trigger.<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I am new here.</p> <p>I’m wondering if OpenAI’s new tool operator can join a Google Meet session and take notes during the meeting. My idea is to have an AI assistant that could listen in and provide a summary or key takeaways, so I can focus on the discussion.</p> <p>Does anyone know if this is currently possible or if there are any integrations/extensions out there that make it work? If not, are there alternative AI tools that you’ve used for this purpose?</p> <p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

## my idea about ASI structure

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In my consideration, ASI is not a single model, but a rl pipeline with enormous instances of strongest models to run and optimize it. This pipeline will be contained inside the structure of any ASI.</p> <p>1 Data module. Gathering data from physical world and virtual world for training data set.</p> <p>2 Training module. Pretrain and post rl train subprocesses.</p> <p>3 Benchmark module. Testing the new outcome model performance in physical and virtual world with more harder tasks.</p> <p>4 Use the smartest model to search solutions found in the last iteration.</p> <p>5 Replace all models in the pipeline with the new smarter model, apply optimizations for next iteration.</p> <p>It&#39;s a meta algorithm but without final convergence.</p> <p>The only limitation is computation theory and computation resources.</p> <p>I think we could get this pipeline without human involved in the next 5 years. </p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi

## Maybe trying to keep China from importing technology and thereby forcing them to innovate it better themselves is making them stronger, as with deepseek.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wonder what the longer term consequences of this will look like. With DeepSeek only requiring 3% of the cost of OpenAi and being far more efficient, and perhaps having a greater model, could this lead to a massive bubble burst and correction in the NASDAQ? With the MAG7 doing all of the heavy lifting, will be interesting to see how it all plays out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/manicmeowmommy"> /u/manicmeowmommy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ia3frk/maybe_trying_to_keep_china_from_importing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ia3frk/maybe_trying_to_keep_china_from_importing/">[comments]</a></span>
