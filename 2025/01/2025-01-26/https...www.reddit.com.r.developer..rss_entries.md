<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all! I&#39;m working on a project right now where essentially I will have a queue that reads off of a server and updates a graphic with the names in the queue, a kiosk where users can add themselves to the queue, and another client that will connect to manage the queue. I want the queue to be displayed on a tv, so I am thinking my implementation for the front end will be a raspberry pi zero W connected to it via HDMI and being powered by the TV&#39;s USB port. Is there some sort of better implementation that I am missing that would be a more practical method of attack?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TFGCards"> /u/TFGCards </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1iahosa/raspberry_pi_frontend/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1iahosa/raspberry_pi_frontend/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, fellow coders! üëã</p> <p>I&#39;m planning to launch a coding challenge in <strong>August</strong> called <strong>Finetune</strong>, designed to help developers sharpen their skills while building cool projects. Here&#39;s how it works:</p> <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a skill you want to improve.<br/> 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build a project from scratch in one month.<br/> 3Ô∏è‚É£ Share weekly updates on your progress and get feedback.<br/> 4Ô∏è‚É£ Compete for a chance to be featured on my new project: freelancing platform for developers.</p> <p>The idea is to help participants grow, connect with other coders, and showcase their work.</p> <p>Would you be interested in joining? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VulcanWM"> /u/VulcanWM </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ia9kef/would_you_join_a_monthly_coding_challenge_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre
