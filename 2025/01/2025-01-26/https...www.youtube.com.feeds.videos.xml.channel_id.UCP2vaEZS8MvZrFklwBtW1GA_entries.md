This video shares how to install DITRA Peel and Stick, also known as DITRA-PS. I recently installed DITRA-PS for a client. So I took the opportunity to outline exactly how it should be done. You'll also see tips for how to remove tile mortar, prime substrates like plywood or concrete, dry-fit the sheets, and more. Many thanks to Schluter for sponsoring this video and providing products for my client's bathroom.
