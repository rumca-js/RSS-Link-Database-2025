I feel like something like this would make it much easier to search and explore the international web and thought there may be a site that does it, but ironically enough it&#39;s quite hard to search for with all the results from the more general translation tools provided by search engines.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/auxfnx\"> /u/auxfnx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1iaho8q/does_a_translating_search_engine_exist/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1iaho8q/does_a_translating_search_engine_exist/\">[comments]</a></span>",
