<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>freezing up*</p> <p>I have an HTC Vive Focus Vision on a TP-Link AX53 AX3000 WiFi 6 network which has two devices, my headset and my pc with ethernet. I am literally standing next to the antennas of the router. As you can see from the video I attached, the issue is not my pc underperforming, i have a beefy one, fpsvr shows that clearly. But it shouldn&#39;t be the network connections either as its supposed to be plenty fast.</p> <p>I set the bitrates to max wherever i could (might have not found some settings)</p> <p>Is there a way I can diagnose this? And fix this? This occurs multiple times most sessions</p> <p>video: <a href="https://streamable.com/m7sdz2">https://streamable.com/m7sdz2</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vajkk"> /u/vajkk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ia9sf3/steamvr_feezing_up/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just recently got a Meta Quest 3, been having a lot of fun. But I have learned that though the headset is standalone and comes with many great games, I am missing out a lot still without PCVR. </p> <p>I have a desktop computer but my computer is a mini computer by ACE Magician, idk crap about computers or what I need to get PCVR to work. But pretty much these are the specs and could you let me know if it’s possible to make PCVR Work. If not what can I get that is affordable?</p> <p>My Mini PC by Ace Magician</p> <p>AMD Ryzen 7 5825U Mini PC 16GB DDR4 512GB SSD Mini Computers (8C/16T, up to 4.5Ghz), 4K Triple Display Mini Desktop </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slow-Organization688"> /u/Slow-Organization688 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ia99n1/recently_got_a_meta_quest_3_thinking_of_pcvr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit
