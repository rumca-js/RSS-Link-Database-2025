<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have 3 boys and we have gone through some tough times but made it through it all with each other. </p> <p>We are at a point now that they are coming of age as young adults and having to take their next big steps into the world and there’s been some trying times again of late. So as to having to push them through and being supportive though they are having hesitations doing so I try to help them understand that it’s something they have to do, it’s causing strain in our relationships. </p> <p>I’ve found it hard to find proper words as a father to express my feelings for them but we all love music and I think it would be fantastic to share some songs that could help express how much they mean to me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the 1960s and 1970s, music was a powerful tool for political expression and protest. Songs like Bob Dylan&#39;s &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#39;&quot;, Edwin Starr’s &quot;War&quot;, and The Beatles’ &quot;Revolution&quot; became anthems for change, speaking directly to the injustices of the time — civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and economic inequality. These songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future.</p> <p>Fast forward to today, and many members of the Baby Boomer generation—the very ones who helped create this powerful music—are now among the most ardent supporters of Donald Trump. This is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism, injustice, and the excesses of the elite. Some examples of iconic political songs from that era:</p> <pre><code>• Bob Dylan – &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin’&quot
