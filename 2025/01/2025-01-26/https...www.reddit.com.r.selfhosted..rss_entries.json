It\u2019s a self-hosted CLI tool that lets you interact with your infrastructure\u2014like PostgreSQL databases, Kubernetes clusters, or cloud providers\u2014using plain English.</p> <p>The idea came from my frustration with constantly Googling commands or juggling multiple CLIs just to get simple things done. So, I thought: why not just <strong><em>talk</em></strong> to my services?</p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works:</p> <ol> <li>You connect to a service with <code>pops conn connect</code>, which grabs all the context the tool needs to understand your setup.</li> <li>Then, you can use the <strong>Prompt-Ops shell</strong> in two ways: <ul> <li><strong>Command Mode</strong>: Ask something like, &quot;Show all tables in my PostgreSQL database,&quot; and it\u2019ll generate the right query or command for you.</li> <li><",

This drive is replicated to two other machines (off site) via Syncthing. While this solution has worked well in the past, the issue is high availability. If the main machine loses power for example, my cloud is no longer reachable. There is no data loss, but until it is powered on again I don&#39;t have access to the data. My solution to this is setting up a Proxmox cluster where I set up a VM on machine A with high availability, so if it goes down it would automatically be replicated on machine B or C. My questions are: 1. How would I set up the external drives on the two additional machines? Simply as storage? 2. How can I migrate from Docker to a Nextcloud VM? 3. Would Proxmox automatically sync the data from the external drives to the nodes as well similar to Syncthing? Because otherwise for HA I would have a working (reachable) Nextcloud VM on for ",
