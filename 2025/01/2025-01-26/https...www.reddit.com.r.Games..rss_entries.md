The chess board is much larger here and can have hidden rooms, traps and many different layouts. The setting is dark with caves, castles and dungeons. </p> <p>In this version of chess the pieces don&#39;t instantly take each other out, instead they each have a health pool that gets depleted by combat and magical spells. To keep your units alive you can cast special healing abilities or give your units health potions as well as item equipment to boost their strength and armor.</p> <p>You’re probably already familiar with the usual chess pieces such as Queens and Pawns. Now there are more archetypes! For example: the Warlock is a ranged caster that shoots fireballs and the Cobra is a serpent with a long range bite and a poison spit ability.</p> <p><em>If you like the sound of this, consider adding the game to your wishlist.
