<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For example, a search engine where I can enter my keywords in English and then select Arabic from a language list. It would then translate that into Arabic for the search and the results it presents are then auto-translated back to English. I feel like something like this would make it much easier to search and explore the international web and thought there may be a site that does it, but ironically enough it&#39;s quite hard to search for with all the results from the more general translation tools provided by search engines.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/auxfnx"> /u/auxfnx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1iaho8q/does_a_translating_search_engine_exist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1iaho8q/does_a_translating_search_engine_exist/">[comments]</a></span>
