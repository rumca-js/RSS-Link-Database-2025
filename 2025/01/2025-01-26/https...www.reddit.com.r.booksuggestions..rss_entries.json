They\u2019ve helped me stay motivated to read, get back in to reading and find out about many books I probably wouldn\u2019t otherwise. I\u2019ll often read my books with live reading sprint videos. But in other ways, I find them very frustrating. almost like they are a members only club where everyone is reading the same books. For example close to 80-90% of the people I follow are all reading \u201cOnyx storm\u201d They all usually have ACOTAR books in the background . I have nothing against the book itself or people who want to read them , I\u2019m just giving an example of how everyone always seems to be reading the same things.
