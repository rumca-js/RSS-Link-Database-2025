<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, this may be a stupid question, but I was just wondering if there is any way to add the WebSub and/or PodPing protocol to an RSS Feed that you do not own or control?</p> <p>There is an hourly news feed bulletin that I follow, but my podcast app (Pocketcast) can be up to 40 minutes late in detecting new episodes. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kevmarl"> /u/kevmarl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iau6bn/websub_or_podping_support/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iau6bn/websub_or_podping_support/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Idk if I&#39;m doing this wrong but when I check the apps the prices I see are €9,49 for Inoreader and between €8,49-16,99 for Feedly. PER MONTH. Does anyone actually pay that much?</p> <p>Are there cheaper alternatives that also sync between devices? No self hosting. Might look into that later but can&#39;t rn</p> <p>Edit: Only looking for services with native Android apps</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MissingNerd"> /u/MissingNerd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ias4ls/why_are_feedly_and_inoreader_so_expensive/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ias4ls/why_are_feedly_and_inoreader_so_expensive/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Asking because I&#39;m not planning on using the new version (the new approach doesn&#39;t work very well for me), but just want to make sure it will still work on new versions of iOS and Mac OS, or if it&#39;s just available to old users but will eventually stop working due to being &quot;abandoned&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p> <p>The developer answered my email. He confirmed what everyone said here. </p> <p>1) It&#39;s a complete product</p> <p>2) It&#39;s not abandoned</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shimirovisky"> /u/Shimirovisky </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iajdgf/is_reeder_classic_been_actively_updated/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iajdgf/is_reeder_classic_been_actively_updated/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to have some way to have an RSS for Pixiv (since a good chunk of my favorite creators are on it) but there is no RSS around, and when I try one of these RSS creator sites it just gives me a blank page. I have very superficial RSS and coding knowledge and wanted to know if someone has any knowledge on this, or how to get around it. I tried a bunch of stuff that did not work, and my last attempt was at <a href="https://rsseverything.com/newfeed">https://rsseverything.com/newfeed</a> where I thought maybe I could use it to work but could never test it since I have 0 knowledge of what I am doing. If there is an way or a workaround PLEASE someone tell me, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Puzzleheaded-Fun5519"> /u/Puzzleheaded-Fun5519 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iaj5vd/pixiv_rss/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss
