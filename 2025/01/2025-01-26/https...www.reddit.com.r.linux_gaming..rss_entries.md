<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a bit obsessed recently with the thought of a first person shooter (more like Overwatch than CS:GO) but with minimal (or zero) anti-cheat on the client side. Perhaps the client could be open source as well. Are there any examples of this being pulled off in AAA games?</p> <p>As for a motive - I think this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8cT1YCsxgo">Low Level</a> explains it well enough. With gaming on Linux in mind, it&#39;s a shame these companies lock out an OS entirely because of kernel level anti-cheats. Coming from a web-dev perspective: everything on the server is validated since JavaScript can be infinitely manipulated. Why are multiplayer games not the same?</p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m being naive, but technically speaking, how feasible does this sound? It makes me question myself, considering kernel level anti-cheats are so prevalent. Here are some scenarios I can think of: </p> <p><strong>Wallhacks/ESP:</strong> I

Apologies for the wall of text, don&#39;t feel like you have to read it lmao.</p> <p>Got a couple of questions I want to ask the subreddit to get some opinions. </p> <p>I&#39;ve ran arch as a rolling release multiple times and I love it, however I have a lot of issues with nvidia drivers as I have a 3070, the main problem is some performance drops that also make my gpu only be used at like 40% and my cpu is the same, maybe I was a noob but it made me go back to windows for work things as I didn&#39;t have to worry about it.</p> <p>However Windows is just being more and more invasive and no matter how many times I disable things like recall it comes back. So I want to jump back to arch full time.</p> <p>I&#39;ve noticed that Nvidia 570 seems to be coming out, so should I wait for it to be added officially to the Arch reop? I want the best support for my gpu that linux can offer. Details about my set up as I had som

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was just testing out the new nvidia 570 *beta* drivers while using cachyos under wayland. It would seem that either GGG fixed something, or these new drivers did, because I can launch the game everytime through stream (Proton Experimental with vulkan renderer) without any black screens. The performance for me is equal now if not better for me on Linux than in windows. </p> <p>Lots of improvements with this upcoming driver, Good Job Nvidia! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MikhajlS"> /u/MikhajlS </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ia75ak/path_of_exile_2_vulkan_works_for_me_now_new/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ia75ak/path_of_exile_2_vulkan_works_for_me_now_new/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Since this is a common topic, and with the RTX 5000 series around the corner, I decided to share my experience with NVIDIA on Linux.</p> <p>Three months ago I switched from an RX 7600 to an RTX 4060 TI 16GB, my main reasons for the switch were because I was unhappy with AMD&#39;s encoder for live streaming and video editing, and because I wanted a more powerful GPU with more VRAM. I bought the RX 7600 specifically for AV1 support, but it ended up having worse quality than HVEC, and an incorrect resolution due to a hardware bug that affects all RX 7000 GPUs, needless to say that I was disappointed.</p> <p>My distro of choice is Fedora Silverblue, which uses GNOME and Wayland, I update the system daily and I upgraded from Fedora Silverblue 40 to 41 the day it released, so I&#39;m up-to-date with the kernel and everything else, so far I&#39;ve never had any issues with NVIDIA drivers breaking. To be fair, when I installed the GPU I had to change a boot
