I noticed today that I hit the limit of API calls with DS and have a large number with ninja. I checked the .xml files on the API calls for both and it is showing shows and episodes I have never heard of. I renewed the API keys and changed my passwords on both and the calls are continuing, albeit at a slower pace, but that just might be because I am waiting the intently and checking more now and I don&#39;t know how to check the actual exact time of the call in the xml file.</p> <p>Any idea how this can be happening? The stack is on a local mini pc behind passwords (not HTTPS) and I never use the services outside of my home. I am using a wireguard VPN assigned in my asus router to the mini pc only.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Starbuckwhatdoyahear\"> /u/Starbuckwhatdoyahear </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet",
