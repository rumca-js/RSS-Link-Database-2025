So I‚Äôm living with a roommate in an apartment and we only have one fob which is used to open doors as well as the gate. I understand somewhat that an rfid tag copier would emit the signal that would let me get into the apartment gym and stuff but the main problem is opening the gate to the parking garage which is only remote controlled with the same fob. Here‚Äôs some pics of it: They charge 150$ for a new one and we‚Äôre only going to stay here for a year max so I was hoping I could find a cheaper alternative. Thank you! üôè </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xx__Senpai__xX">

But I am sure here has to be some hidden gems out there. I know SpecterOps has some good videos, but I watched many of them already.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My shitty dorm WiFi service requires us to pay quite expensive amount for a captive portal &quot;voucher code&quot; on a monthly basis, apart from the already huge tuition fees which probably includes the fee of internet as well. Mind that the speeds are utter trash and we face downtimes frequently too. Its plain scam at this point. Many just stopped paying for it, but some tech dudes somehow managed to get &quot;member login&quot; details - i assume its used by the IT guys for trouble shooting and stuffs, so they just get to access it for free. These douchebags wont just share the secret. I wanna do the same. </p> <p>Can someone please give a noob-friendly guide to bypass/crack to get free network access?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tinyrick_137"> /u/tinyrick_137 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ia9lp3/bypass_captive_portals_for_free_internet/">[link]</a><
