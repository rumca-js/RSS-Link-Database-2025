I&#39;m trying to create a USB camera device that can apply filters to the video stream. I&#39;m quite new to using the camera module and followed the instructions from here: <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/plug-and-play-raspberry-pi-usb-webcam/\">https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/plug-and-play-raspberry-pi-usb-webcam/</a>.</p> <p>It worked perfectly, but then I wanted to add a filter. So, I tried to create a virtual camera device using v4l2-ctl and intended to use that as the source for the usb-gadget script. Then I wrote a Python script (though maybe I should have done it in C++) that takes input from the real camera, applies the filter, and sets the output as the input for the virtual camera. However, the usb-gadget script doesn&#39;t recognize the virtual camera, and now I&#39;m stuck.</p> <p>Do you have any advice on where to learn",

Problem is, that with the new 4k resolution the text in the terminal and also the UI of moonlight are way to small and I therefore want to force 1080p resolution again.</p> <p>I first tried appending &quot;video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080@60D&quot; to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt but that only got me a 1080p output in the top left quarter of the display, and moonlight would not be able to start anymore.</p> <p>I then tried to set the resolution via Wayland using a tutorial. But I failed on the first step because entering &quot;wlr-randr&quot; only results in &quot;command not found&quot;, although Wayland seems to be installed since I can choose between it and X11 in the raspi config.
