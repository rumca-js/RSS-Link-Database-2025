<p>Actor Rachel Ward’s sterling efforts to farm sustainably make for an inspiring, charming documentary. It places optimism and energy front and centre</p><p>Hang on – the Rachel in Rachel’s Farm is Rachel Ward?! By heavens, it is! She was the star of the 1983 cassock-ripper The Thorn Birds, which united several countries in pursuit of the question of whether her young, wild Meggie – in the Australian outback to help her aunt run a sheep station – would persuade the local priest (played by 1983’s Richard Chamberlain) to forsake his calling for earthly pleasures. Well, Ward has now forsaken acting&nbsp;for literal earthly pleasures and become a regenerative farmer.</p><p>This charming and inspiring (if slightly rambling) 90-minute film takes us to the smallholding she and her husband, Bryan Brown (yes, him from The Thorn Birds, too!

<p>China’s tech leap challenges US dominance through innovation. But unregulated competition increases the risk of catastrophe</p><p>Eight years ago, Vladimir Putin proclaimed that mastering artificial intelligence (AI) would make a nation the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/4/16251226/russia-ai-putin-rule-the-world">ruler of the world</a>”.

<p>New research shows western medicine’s traditional split between brain and body is, in fact, far from clear cut – and could provide a breakthrough for many complex conditions<br></p><p>Some years ago Camilla Nord suffered such persistent pain at the site of an old injury that doctors thought she would need major surgery – a joint replacement in her foot. To delay this for a few months, they injected the foot with steroids. Steroids wear off – but nearly a decade later, the pain was still much reduced. To Nord, whose day job is running the Mental Health Neuroscience Lab at the University of Cambridge, this was fascinating. Not all of her pain, it seemed, came from her foot.</p><p>As Nord knew, chronic pain can cause physiological changes in the brain – a process that is now measurable in the lab. It seemed to her that her brain, as she puts it in her recent book, The Balanced Brain, “had become used to pain, monitored pain, and had begun to enhance the sensation of pain on my body”.

<p>Joe Biden’s pardon of Marcus Garvey capped a decades-long campaign to restore the reputation of one of the most significant Black leaders of the 20th century</p><p>In the days before President Joe Biden’s final moments in office, Justin Hansford, a Howard University law professor, received a call from a White House staffer. They told Hansford that Marcus Garvey, the revolutionary Jamaican leader who pushed for the unity of Black people and a collective return to Africa, would soon be posthumously pardoned for mail fraud.</p><p>Hansford dialed in Garvey’s son, Dr Julius Garvey, for a three-way call to break the news to him before it hit the newspaper circuit. As he thought of his nearly two decades of legal and advocacy work to help exonerate Garvey, Hansford remembered Garvey’s wife <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/garvey-jacques/">Amy Jacques</a> who began the efforts to pardon him in 1923.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jan/26/

O’Toole has every reason to be sincere about the humble spud. In November 2020, when she was an out-of-work chef, she made a TikTok video of her “crispy crunchy parmesan roasties”, which quickly got a million views. Since then, she has built up 4.4 million followers on TikTok, 1.1 million on Instagram, and is a regular on TV, whipping up potato dishes on <em>Saturday Kitchen</em> and <em>This Morning</em>. It is only a wonder that it has taken her so long to get around to writing an entire potato-themed cookbook.

Down 5-6, 30-30 on his serve in the second set, as Alexander Zverev tried desperately to steal the set, the German pounced on a forehand and flitted forward to the net. Sinner responded to the danger by producing one of the most brilliant points of the tournament, chasing down every last shot before slipping a pinpoint backhand winner past his flailing opponent at the net.</p><p>It was another demonstration of supreme mental fortitude from an incredible tennis player who continues to establish himself as a potential all-time great.

Anxious to entice valuable employees away from the comforts of working from home, or from defecting to rivals, companies offer them spas, gyms and views of greenery.

<p>Research into the disease has never been more far-reaching, but there is little consensus as to what is causing the rocketing rates of diagnosis in young adults</p><p>In 2022, around 16% of the 20 million people with cancer worldwide were under 50. Cancer has always been markedly more of an older person’s disease, says Lynn Turner, director of research at Worldwide Cancer Research. But between 1990 and 2019, the incidence of the disease in under-50s rose by 79%, according to <a href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049">research</a> published in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> in 2023.
