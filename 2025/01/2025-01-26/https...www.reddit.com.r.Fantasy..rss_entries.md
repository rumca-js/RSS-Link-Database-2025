<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For me- it was a good surprise. I recently read Dungeon Crawler Carl for the first time after having it recommended repeatedly by different friends, accounts I follow, and various posts on Reddit. The synopsis didn’t sound like a book I’d gravitate towards normally- my favorites are classic sword &amp; sorcery or high fantasy but I’ll read just about anything at least once. And since I had recently hit the bottom of my TBR list I finally gave DCC a shot. </p> <p>Y’all- I loved it. I was wary because I don’t typically love books that are primarily humorous. I’ll enjoy reading them for a bit but if there’s no story to really draw me in I usually end up DNF’ing them. DCC pleasantly surprised me by having a story I cared about. The main character has a good heart and follows a surprisingly classic underdog hero’s journey despite the modern setting. </p> <p>I also enjoyed the game element. I am not a big gamer- the closest I get is stardew valley. But the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Picked up the book the other day and oh my god. The feeling of horror and anticipation in this book is something I&#39;ve never felt in a fantasy book before. It&#39;s left me aching :) for more books like it, so I would appreciate it if anyone has recommendations for similar books.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dj_pump_bucket"> /u/dj_pump_bucket </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ia8w3a/aching_god_by_mike_shel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ia8w3a/aching_god_by_mike_shel/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel like I&#39;m losing my mind. I just keep seeing the same recommendations for Logan nine fingers, mistborne, wheel of time, Malazan. Drizzt. </p> <p>I just finished the Greatcoats. It was a good series but I feel like the story followed the least interesting character. I want to read about a character in a fantasy setting who is generally the best fighter around. I&#39;d prefer it if he wasn&#39;t a magic user, but rather a fighter, like with a sword. </p> <p>I feel like there should be hundreds of such fantasy books but I can&#39;t seem to find one. </p> <p><strong>Edit: list of recommendations I keep seeing, and to which is like alternative recommendations—black company, anything by Sanderson, acts of Caine, Elric of Melbourne.</strong></p> <p><strong>Edit 2: To clarify, I&#39;m not looking for a book with an OP protagonist. Just one where his skill is central</strong>. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It was a generally satisfying and enjoyable ride! I ripped through all three books in two days, had a great time reading it, and would recommend it to my friends. That being said!! I have some thoughts.</p> <p>Starting with the positives:</p> <p>1) Kell Maresh is one of my favorite protagonists in a long time. I find his character set up as a dying breed of rare magician, his complicated ties with the royal family, and his character growth to be very satisfying throughout the trilogy. Personally, I love characters who suffer from the weight of responsibility, are extremely competent, and also traumatized, and Kell checks all the boxes. </p> <p>2) The creativity of crossing between alternate Londons is amazing, and I think it’s one of the coolest parallel world ideas I’ve encountered in a while.</p> <p>And all of these positives come with qualifiers, which are:</p> <p>1) Kell Maresh is a great character BUT the real complexities and contradictions in 

## I dislike how Codex Alera is described as Pokemon + Roman Legion

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know, the story behind how the series was created is that someone dared Jim Butcher to create a series based on any 2 random things, and they picked Pokemon and Romans. But that&#39;s not the vibe when I read it. </p> <p>If someone told me it was Pokemon with Roman Legion, I&#39;d be expecting a monster collecting/raising story where a kid is training to be the very best and has a rival and collects/adventures with hundreds of unique creatures. </p> <p>Instead, I&#39;d describe it as Game of Thrones lite with Avatar the Last Airbender magic system. The main plot of the story revolves around political intrigue of multiple different houses scheming and betraying each other to become the next ruler of the nation. With a frozen wall to the north holding back savages and nomadic tribal warriors being underestimated by society. (These are tropes in many fantasy series, but both feel inspired by GoT to me) And the magic system is pure elemental magic wher

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a huge classic detective fiction fan- Dorothy L. Sayers and Agatha Christie wrote most of what I&#39;ve been reading lately- and I&#39;d love to find some fantasy books that have the same vibe, or the vibe of the Brother Cadfael murder mysteries! </p> <p>A book I read recently that has that vibe is The Beanstalk Murder by PG Bell - it&#39;s kinda like if the giant chapter from The Silver Chair was the whole book, and instead of being cannibals the giants are all Agatha Christie villains. It&#39;s a really good time- and I&#39;d love to find some stuff like that for grownups, lol. </p> <p>(I tried Glen Cook&#39;s Garrett Files series and I just did not care for the way Garrett sees women; really wanted to like them, but they just weren&#39;t for me.) </p> <p>Any recommendations? Any thoughts on what makes a good fantasy mystery? Any advice on how to find them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/us
