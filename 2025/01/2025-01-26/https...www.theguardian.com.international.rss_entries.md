<p>For brighter, healthy-looking skin a weekly hydrating mask is a winter essential</p><p>I have long eschewed the arduous multi-stepped skincare regime that once upon a time promised us our “best skin ever!” This was because very quickly I realised two things: 1) I lacked the commitment to the game, and 2) I discovered that using tons of products all at once is really confusing for the skin – imagine 15 people trying to speak at the same time. Yeah, exactly. Also, using a million and one products – particularly those with active ingredients – won’t necessarily deliver great skin. Instead, it will give you the gift of super-sensitised skin and an annoying catch-22 situation that will have you going around in circles as you constantly battle new skincare issues. I say all this to reiterate that minimising your skincare steps is definitely a good idea. However, certain steps should remain in place – such as face masks, particularly a hydrating mask.

<p><strong>Sundance film festival:</strong> A primary school teacher in Russia pushes back on cruel nationalist propaganda in a fascinating and daring look at everyday encroachment</p><p>Pavel Talankin is, by his own admission early in the extraordinary documentary Mr Nobody Against Putin, not the person you or he would pick to be the hero of the story or to take on an oppressive regime. To stand up to Vladimir Putin takes a considerable amount of courage and a not inconsiderable amount of resources; Pasha, as he is known to his students, is a teacher at a small primary school in Karabash, a mining town in the Ural mountains remarkable only for its renowned levels of toxic waste, and would have been more or less content to remain the titular nobody far from Moscow. He loves his hometown, its smokestacks and Soviet buildings, but most of all loves the curiosity and enthusiasm of his students, all filmed by Talankin in his capacity as school videographer.</p><p>But Talankin has always

<p>Christiane Amanpour has spent four decades as a celebrated journalist and war reporter. With disinformation rampaging through the media, she talks about the threat of technocracy, Donald Trump’s second term – and why facts are more important than ever</p><p>Just occasionally, in more than 40 years of reporting the world’s troubles, Christiane Amanpour has forced herself to step away and pause for breath. One of those moments for rebooting came over Christmas and new year, when she took a holiday in South Africa. I met her on the day she got back to work at the CNN offices in London, from which she makes her nightly news programme, and Saturday’s <em><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/title-2447319">The Amanpour Hour</a></em>. There is a powerful sense of her team buckling up for the tumultuous year ahead. “What I cover is the international reverberations of what America does in the world and what might be coming back at America,” she says. “The good, the bad and the ugly.”</p
