I&#39;m not trying to do anything crazy internally with my phone, I just don&#39;t want google anywhere near it. The things people are discussing about Murena go way over my head but maybe implies its a lot of maintenance with sideloading (again whatever that means) and other things.</p> <p>Is this something I have to do as a very casual phone user? I just wanna text, play games, use the internet, and have useful apps as various tools. Would something like Murena fit that vibe? Is it something a person like me could handle? Are there any other options that are simpler? Please help!</p> </div><
