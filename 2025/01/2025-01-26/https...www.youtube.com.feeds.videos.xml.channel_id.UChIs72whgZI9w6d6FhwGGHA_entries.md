In this hardware news recap for the week, we talk about the unopenable PC case that'll stump GN (it uses magnets), the AMD RX 9070 and 9070 XT inbound, counterfeit Ryzen 9800X3D CPUs, the RTX 5090 supply limitations and shortages, and KINGPIN considering a "color" change for GPUs. We'll also cover the Reuters report on TSMC's delays for tech arriving to the US. Finally, news from SilverStone on its FLP-01 now going to more distributors around the world -- we're excited to test the case!
