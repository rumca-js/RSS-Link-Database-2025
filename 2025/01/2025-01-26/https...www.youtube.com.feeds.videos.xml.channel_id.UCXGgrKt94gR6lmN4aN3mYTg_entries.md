I decided to buy everything YouTube advertised to me for 30 minutes straight and things got interesting fast. From a surprisingly decent budget gaming laptop to some questionable lighting equipment, I put each product through real-world testing to see if any of these ads are actually worth your money. Spoiler alert: some of these purchases were actually pretty good, while others... well, you'll have to watch to find out.
