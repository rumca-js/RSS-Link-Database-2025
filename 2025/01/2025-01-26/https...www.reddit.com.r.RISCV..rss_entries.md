<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>They missed the promised &quot;Within 30 days of the order&quot;. It&#39;s 49 days since I ordered on December 8. As they informed me on January 7th, the PCB had a signal quality issue and they needed to redesign it, and at that time they estimated shipping before &quot;Spring Festival&quot; aka Chinese New Year which starts on January 29, so they&#39;ve beaten that.</p> <p>Orders opened on November 25, so I was a little slow. Have other people&#39;s orders shipped?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brucehoult"> /u/brucehoult </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ia69qh/my_milkv_megrez_p550_has_shipped_from_arace/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ia69qh/my_milkv_megrez_p550_has_shipped_from_arace/">[comments]</a></span>
