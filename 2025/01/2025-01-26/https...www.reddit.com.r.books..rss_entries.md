<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished reading this wonderful short story. Keegan brings 1980’s Ireland to life through her writing, and even though it’s such a simple story of kindness and how to be human is to be kind, it’s still such an engrossing read. Furlong’s daily life and musings were a joy to read too. I teared up a bit at the part where he first met the girl in the convent, and again towards the end where he rescued her from the convent. I couldn’t put this book down after I finished reading the 4th chapter. It’s well past midnight here but I knew I had to go all the way and finish it in one sitting, which I haven’t done for a long, long time because of a chronic reading slump. Looking forward to reading more of Keegan’s work after this.</p> <p>Okay enough rambling I guess, but yeah I highly recommend this short and moving story to anyone who’s going through a reading slump, and to anyone who’d like to emerge a little bit more optimistic after finishing it about o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just picked up The Alchemyst (Michael Scott not The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho) again, and Jesus I forgot how wild this book is. It threw me right into the action with magic, alchemy, and a bunch of random historical figures like Nicholas Flamel and Dr. John Dee, except they’re immortal and cool and warriors in an ancient battle or something </p> <p>I remember loving this series a decade ago, but I don’t see many people talking about it anymore. It’s got that fun mix of mythology and weird kinda crazy fast-paced adventure, kind of like Percy Jackson, but with a different more serious doom and gloom vibe.</p> <p>Has anyone else read this? What did you think? Does it hold up years later or?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMechanic7777"> /u/TheMechanic7777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iatafs/anyone_else_remember_the_secrets_of_the_immortal/">[link]</a></s

## When reading a book, do you visualize real people?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished the Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (I know I know, I&#39;m late to the party). And I just could. not. stop. visualizing Angelina Jolie as Evelyn, and Anderson Cooper as Harry. </p> <p>Do you do this? When you read a book do you visualize a real person (famous or not), into a character? </p> <p>For me it happens most with books that I can easily imagine becoming a movie or a tv series. I immediately &#39;cast&#39; the story in my mind. Fun but it can be annoying too, especially if the author&#39;s descriptions don&#39;t line up with my own imagining.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/busyshrew"> /u/busyshrew </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iarm5r/when_reading_a_book_do_you_visualize_real_people/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iarm5r/when_reading_a_book_do_you_visualize_real_people/">[comments]</a></span>

## One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) by Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa (Translator) (spoilers)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Gabriel García Márquez&#39;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;</strong> is a journey through time, magic, and the human experience. This is my first experience reading a novel written as a stream of consciousness, and I admit it was challenging. It was hard to find a natural pause in which to stop. Set in the fictional town of Macondo, the novel chronicles the Buendía family across seven generations, weaving a rich tapestry of love, ambition, and destiny. The novel&#39;s structure is both intricate and ingenious, as time spirals rather than flows linearly, with events and character traits echoing across generations. This cyclical nature is emphasized by the repetition of names, creating a sense of déjà vu that permeates the narrative. <em>As a history enthusiast, I found this mirroring of historical patterns particularly engaging</em>.</p> <p>García Márquez&#39;s use of magical realism creates a world where the strange seamlessly ming

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to make a post for this memoir that I just finished reading. I did a search and didn’t find any previous posts. </p> <p>This book was such a great read. It describes a Puerto Rican girl’s struggle through a childhood of poverty with a mentally ill mother. It really tells a type of story that doesn’t get a lot of mainstream attention, a story of an underrepresented people. I really appreciated the perspective. It was also not written purely chronologically, it jumped around a little bit focused on specific incidents that really affected the girl as she grew up. I enjoyed that aspect because it felt more true to how we experience our past.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shanacan"> /u/Shanacan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iallqh/ordinary_girls_by_jaquira_diaz/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iallqh/ordin

## Emojis in books- thoughts?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a strong dislike of emojis being used in books. I understand it’s a sign of the time, but to me it undermines the integrity and seriousness of the writing style and book itself. I’m curious what you think when you come across an emoji printed in a book? Is it corny? Or is it an accurate reflection of modern communication styles? </p> <p>Example: Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt uses emojis in the book. I distinctly remember the “💩 “ emoji in that book. Edit: the emoji in this book was used within a text message between characters. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Valuable-Usual8549"> /u/Valuable-Usual8549 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ialhli/emojis_in_books_thoughts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ialhli/emojis_in_books_thoughts/">[comments]</a></span>

## What book had a fantastic premise, but the writing style just ruined it for you?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have read a few books where the premise is actually great but the writing style/execution of the book made it not an enjoyable read. I get especially frustrated with these reads because I feel like it could have been a 4 or 5 star book if it went through another round of rewrites or editing. </p> <p>One that comes to mind for myself is Definitely Better Now by Ava Robinson because it was the last book I read that fell under this category. I LOVED the premise. It was about a character who was getting sober in her mid 20s in NYC. It was about dealing with your past life catching up to you and how you can still have self-destructive tendencies when sober. I fell in love with the premise because I feel like it was a story that was not tapped into yet. I have not read any book about getting sober in your 20s and the complications that comes with it from social norms to people&#39;s reactions to getting sober young. </p> <p>But the writing style ruined i

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is a novel set in modern day Ireland about a young woman who starts an affair with a married man. It&#39;s all about her, her best friend/ex, and this married couple who their lives become intertwined with. It sounds kinda boring and not the kind of book I would normally read but I was blown away!</p> <p>It&#39;s such an incisive look at class, gender, relationships, and most of all power dynamics. The main character feels disempowered by her life circumstances and attempts to gain that back however she can, mostly in small ways. It&#39;s absolutely fascinating and every moment has something to unravel. It&#39;s also quite dryly funny. </p> <p>I&#39;ve heard this book can be a bit divisive but I quite enjoyed it. This is the scene that I can&#39;t stop thinking about. I&#39;m not sure if it works out of context but it&#39;s extremely jarring while reading.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>JFR: The Lies We Conjure by Sarah Henning</p> <p>I loved this book because it wasn’t so complicated for my brain to comprehend the fantasy/magical world in it. And it did bring me out of my rut. </p> <p>But I have some questions and rants about the book 😆. Feel free to join and also share your thoughts on it. </p> <p>Questions: 1) Where is Athena Blackgate? Is she dead or alive? 2) What happened to Hegemony kids’ mothers? Ursula’s kids are surrogated but are her grandchildren surrogated as well? 3) Luna says the dead driver is a non-witch or something? So how did they miss Ruby and Wren? </p> <p>Rants: I enjoyed the writing but it did get a little annoying when Auden and Ruby’s POV was reflecting a same tone here and there. I felt that it could have been a little more distinct from the other. </p> <p>And I felt like Ursula’s murder and the whole whodunnit thing could have been explained better with emphasis like how they do it in a usual whodunnit bo
