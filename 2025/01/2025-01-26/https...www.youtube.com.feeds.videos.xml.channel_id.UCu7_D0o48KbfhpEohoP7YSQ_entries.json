I got one of the first engineering samples to show to you.\nBecause it is based on the C6, we first have a look at this chip. Then we try the new board on 5.8 GHz. And finally, we use the Zigbee test functionality with Home Assistant.\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nESP32-C6: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oF9adnL\nESP32-C6 Supermini: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oovbaRR\nESP32-C5 Reference page: https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c5\nESP32-C6 Datasheet: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c6_datasheet_en.pdf\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot.org\nGitHub: https://www.github.com/sensorsiot\nMy Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/AndreasSpiess\nDiscord: https:",
