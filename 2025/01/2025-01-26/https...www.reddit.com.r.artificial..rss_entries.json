They have been consistently at the cutting edge of machine learning and big data, you just don&#39;t hear about it because they keep every single thing they do a closely guarded secret and have no need for marketing their capabilities. They have some of the smartest people in the field, who are drawn to these companies because there is just so much more money to be made there, compared to an AI Research position. For an autonomous trading system to be continually competitive in quickly evolving markets, I believe its capabilities will need to be more and more <em>general</em> to accurately model human behavior and markets, therefore these systems could effectively be called &quot;<strong>ASI</strong>&quot; if they are not already there today.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",
