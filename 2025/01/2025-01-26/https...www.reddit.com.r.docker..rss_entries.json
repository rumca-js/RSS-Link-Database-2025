I am somewhat familiar with the command line due to working with Macs over the years. I have managed to get Qbittorrent running on my WD PR4100 NAS by installing docker/portainer. What I am failing to do is to get the container to be able to download to one of the NAS shares. </p> <p>The NAS share is called Transmission. It is located at /shares/Volume_1/Transmission</p> <p>I have tried every combination I can think of to just create a /Transmission volume or bind or whatever and nothing works.
