<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, odd issue that i don&#39;t see mentioned anywhere and not sure how to get TS, i had to format my pc and reinstall greenluma which always used to work fine.</p> <p>I installed it fresh, which i did less then a month ago pre-format so the files themselves should be fine, my friend using the same files has no issues. No matter what, I add the games to greenluma and if i launch a family shared game it will say &quot;this game is in use by another family, closing in 3 mins&quot; then close. What&#39;s crazy is that this happens if nobody is playing anything, i tried multiple games and they all have the same issue, old and new. I can family share them just fine, but i can&#39;t greenluma a single game without it closing.</p> <p>Clearly greenluma is set up properly otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be changing the ownership to me and causing the issue in the first place</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user
