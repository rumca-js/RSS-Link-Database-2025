The ESP32-C5 is the first dual-band chip with 2.4 and 5.8 GHz WiFi. I got one of the first engineering samples to show to you.
Because it is based on the C6, we first have a look at this chip. Then we try the new board on 5.8 GHz. And finally, we use the Zigbee test functionality with Home Assistant.
