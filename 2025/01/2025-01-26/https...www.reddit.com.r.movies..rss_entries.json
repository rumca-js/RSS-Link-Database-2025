From Jenny\u2019s abuse, to all the characters suffering so badly that if you put yourself in your shoes for a moment, you wonder how they haven\u2019t gone crazy.</p> <p>Biggest shock factor for me was the scene at the start where Mrs Gump is essentially coerced into sex with the principal to get her son into school.

No scenes featuring gratuitous violence, homophobia or any of the other tropes. Instead it&#39;s about the healing and reforming power of art, and features one of the strongest depictions of male friendship and comraderie outside of a war movie. It subverts the typical toxic masculine energy of its genre and shows us real men who have been inside having the time of their lives playing dress up, communicating with emotional maturity, crying. As a young man growing up in the age of the redpill movement, i think movies like this are not only a breath of fresh air, but necessary. I found it incredibly moving and it currently stands as my movie of the year of 2024. Clarence Maclin was snubbed for a best supporting actor nom, but I would love if he won for Best Adapted Screenplay. A masterpiece in my opinion, and fully deserves every win it gets.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",

Which is kind of crazy cause of how growing up like most Mexican and/or Hispanic American homes and especially even more so with boys as you grow into men. You are taught to be so macho and not as emotional. This definitely not only deserves the best animated Oscar, but really should have been nominated in the best pictures of the year too.

Not only is it Josh Harnett , Tom Sizemore, Ewan mcgregor, and Eric bana, but Tom hardy and Orlando bloom are in this. So is the actor who plays Jamie Lannister . Wtf! So good. Honorable mentions also include William fitchtner AND Jeremy piven. It\u2019s also a very good movie , I just can\u2019t believe how many all stars it had (many before they got big I guess).?</p> <p>Edit: adding ty Burrell!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fearless-Cherry-4587\"> /u/Fearless-Cherry-4587 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia2ev4/black_hawk_down_literally_the_most_star_studded/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia2ev4/black_hawk_down_literally_the_most_star_studded/\">[comments]</a></span>",
