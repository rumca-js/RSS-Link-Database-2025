I'm back from the Las Vegas Open! It was a heck of a trip, and I'll tell you about all about it, and of course, I'll also answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

Vince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com

I'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you! Use code 'FactoryUncle5' at checkout to get 5% off of your entire order at http://www.thearmypainter.com or check my favorite Army Painter products at https://thearmypainter.com/tabletop-minions

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
