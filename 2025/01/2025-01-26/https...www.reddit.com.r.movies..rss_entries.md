<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just sat down and watched John Carter. Unfortunately, when it first came out, I listened to the opinions of critics instead of seeing it and forming my own opinions. If I remember correctly, it came out on the same date as another big movie and Disney lost money on it because of poor planning. I thought it was a solid stand-alone sci-fi movie, although I haven&#39;t read any of the source material by Edgar Rice Burroughs.</p> <p>Just my two cents.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GeekyNiceGuy1985"> /u/GeekyNiceGuy1985 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iasvp7/john_carter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iasvp7/john_carter/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Great movie, but I hadn’t seen it since I was a kid myself. On rewatch it’s crazy just how many things fly under the radar when you’re young. From Jenny’s abuse, to all the characters suffering so badly that if you put yourself in your shoes for a moment, you wonder how they haven’t gone crazy.</p> <p>Biggest shock factor for me was the scene at the start where Mrs Gump is essentially coerced into sex with the principal to get her son into school. As a child I had no idea - for some reason I thought the principal was just having an asthma attack in the house, which explained the weird noises he made. </p> <p>Anyway, any other films you rewatched and were surprised at as an older person? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ovid738"> /u/Ovid738 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iarpio/rewatched_forrest_gump_totally_forgot_how_dark_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A prison drama that doesn&#39;t tread the same ground as the others in its genre. No scenes featuring gratuitous violence, homophobia or any of the other tropes. Instead it&#39;s about the healing and reforming power of art, and features one of the strongest depictions of male friendship and comraderie outside of a war movie. It subverts the typical toxic masculine energy of its genre and shows us real men who have been inside having the time of their lives playing dress up, communicating with emotional maturity, crying. As a young man growing up in the age of the redpill movement, i think movies like this are not only a breath of fresh air, but necessary. I found it incredibly moving and it currently stands as my movie of the year of 2024. Clarence Maclin was snubbed for a best supporting actor nom, but I would love if he won for Best Adapted Screenplay. A masterpiece in my opinion, and fully deserves every win it gets.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As I finish this movie, this movie does so many things right. It makes you think of the beginning situation one way and throughout the movie it comes out to be something deeper. Seeing Edward be so self conscious, and seeing him think that once he gets this miracle drug then his life will be better. Until he meets someone who has the same disease he then sees how much they embrace life, how confident they are in their own skin. It’s such a beautiful and smart film that this for me is a Top 3 A24 film! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gingerbread0596"> /u/Gingerbread0596 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia4has/different_man_is_brilliant/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia4has/different_man_is_brilliant/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw The Brutalist today (huge recommend) but while watching I realized this is not the first movie made starring Adrien Brody as a Holocaust survivor. It got me thinking: has an actor before been in multiple Holocaust movies before? Or better yet, is there an actor who has &quot;lived&quot; through the same war multiple times?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bob_loblaw_0211"> /u/bob_loblaw_0211 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia3pyt/what_actor_has_lived_through_the_holocaust_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia3pyt/what_actor_has_lived_through_the_holocaust_the/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Idk how I missed this. Not only is it Josh Harnett , Tom Sizemore, Ewan mcgregor, and Eric bana, but Tom hardy and Orlando bloom are in this. So is the actor who plays Jamie Lannister . Wtf! So good. Honorable mentions also include William fitchtner AND Jeremy piven. It’s also a very good movie , I just can’t believe how many all stars it had (many before they got big I guess).?</p> <p>Edit: adding ty Burrell!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fearless-Cherry-4587"> /u/Fearless-Cherry-4587 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia2ev4/black_hawk_down_literally_the_most_star_studded/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ia2ev4/black_hawk_down_literally_the_most_star_studded/">[comments]</a></span>
