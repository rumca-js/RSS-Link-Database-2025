<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have had my media server stack up and running for a few weeks. I noticed today that I hit the limit of API calls with DS and have a large number with ninja. I checked the .xml files on the API calls for both and it is showing shows and episodes I have never heard of. I renewed the API keys and changed my passwords on both and the calls are continuing, albeit at a slower pace, but that just might be because I am waiting the intently and checking more now and I don&#39;t know how to check the actual exact time of the call in the xml file.</p> <p>Any idea how this can be happening? The stack is on a local mini pc behind passwords (not HTTPS) and I never use the services outside of my home. I am using a wireguard VPN assigned in my asus router to the mini pc only.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Starbuckwhatdoyahear"> /u/Starbuckwhatdoyahear </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, all</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using usenet for a year or so now, but I&#39;m noticing that my NZBGeek seems to miss episodes of TV Shows that I can download manually if I look for them on newshosting through the newsreader. I don&#39;t really understand why this happens and I&#39;m wondering if anyone can shed any light on what could be the issue here?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kamaad"> /u/kamaad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iahz5n/nzb_indexers_miss_files/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iahz5n/nzb_indexers_miss_files/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m looking for advice please. Currently with slug and ninja, and I&#39;m struggling to find audiobooks that I previously downloaded many years ago and foolishly deleted...
