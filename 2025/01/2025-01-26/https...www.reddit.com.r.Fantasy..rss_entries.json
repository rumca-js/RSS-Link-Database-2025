I ripped through all three books in two days, had a great time reading it, and would recommend it to my friends. That being said!! I have some thoughts.</p> <p>Starting with the positives:</p> <p>1) Kell Maresh is one of my favorite protagonists in a long time. I find his character set up as a dying breed of rare magician, his complicated ties with the royal family, and his character growth to be very satisfying throughout the trilogy. Personally, I love characters who suffer from the weight of responsibility, are extremely competent, and also traumatized, and Kell checks all the boxes. </p> <p>2) The creativity of crossing between alternate Londons is amazing, and I think it\u2019s one of the coolest parallel world ideas I\u2019ve encountered in a while.</p> <p>And all of these positives come with qualifiers, which are:</p> <p>1) Kell Maresh is a great character BUT the real complexities and contradictions in ",

But that&#39;s not the vibe when I read it. </p> <p>If someone told me it was Pokemon with Roman Legion, I&#39;d be expecting a monster collecting/raising story where a kid is training to be the very best and has a rival and collects/adventures with hundreds of unique creatures. </p> <p>Instead, I&#39;d describe it as Game of Thrones lite with Avatar the Last Airbender magic system. The main plot of the story revolves around political intrigue of multiple different houses scheming and betraying each other to become the next ruler of the nation.

Sayers and Agatha Christie wrote most of what I&#39;ve been reading lately- and I&#39;d love to find some fantasy books that have the same vibe, or the vibe of the Brother Cadfael murder mysteries! </p> <p>A book I read recently that has that vibe is The Beanstalk Murder by PG Bell - it&#39;s kinda like if the giant chapter from The Silver Chair was the whole book, and instead of being cannibals the giants are all Agatha Christie villains. It&#39;s a really good time- and I&#39;d love to find some stuff like that for grownups, lol. </p> <p>(I tried Glen Cook&#39;s Garrett Files series and I just did not care for the way Garrett sees women; really wanted to like them, but they just weren&#39;t for me.) </p> <p>Any recommendations? Any thoughts on what makes a good fantasy mystery? Any advice on how to find them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",
