So I\u2019m living with a roommate in an apartment and we only have one fob which is used to open doors as well as the gate. I understand somewhat that an rfid tag copier would emit the signal that would let me get into the apartment gym and stuff but the main problem is opening the gate to the parking garage which is only remote controlled with the same fob. Here\u2019s some pics of it: They charge 150$ for a new one and we\u2019re only going to stay here for a year max so I was hoping I could find a cheaper alternative. Thank you! \ud83d\ude4f </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Xx__Senpai__xX\"> ",
