<p>Ben Stiller, <a href="https://x.com/BenStiller/status/1882792326982250665">on X</a>, posted a short video with Tim Cook as a severed employee at Lumon Industries. Very fun, and it’s really the only thing on people’s minds about Tim Cook lately — that he’s a fun guy. Definitely the only thing people are thinking about him lately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Tim Cook Severance promo is wild because I always felt like
the show could be about Apple - a company with such a deep, crazy
culture of secrecy that they’d be the first to opt for severed
employees in the workforce.</p>

<p>Also, my work there was always mysterious and important.</p>
