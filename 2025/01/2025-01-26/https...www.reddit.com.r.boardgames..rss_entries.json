So many prominent, popular games are basically just gone, with no realistic prospect of reprints, and with the existing used stock gradually falling apart. (The golden years of FFG are especially depressing here, particularly their licensed stuff.) Worse, even newish games can be surprisingly hard to get, with very limited stock if you don&#39;t back expensive crowdfunding campaigns years before.</p> <p>At least with digital games there&#39;s the prospect of emulation and piracy. But with physical games we have...what? Sometimes a TTS module (hopefully complete), maybe the ability to print-and-play for some card games.</p> <p>Is there any way to improve the situation, realistically? Or is this just a hobby where we have to get used to buying games early &quot;just in case&quot;, or else hope you can overpay for a limited pool of used copies?</p> </div><!-- SC",
