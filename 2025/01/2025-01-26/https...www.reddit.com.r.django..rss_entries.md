<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Apologies for the rather basic question, but I&#39;m developing an app locally and have just switched from sqlite to postgres. The database for the app is working fine, but not so the temporary database that Pytest (or unittest) sets up. I keep getting errors like this: &#39;django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation &quot;users_customuser&quot; does not exist&#39;, which suggests that the tables in the test DB are not being created correctly. I&#39;ve tried mucking around with migrations, and the USER permissions for the test DB appear appropriate (though by no means do I have a lot of expertise with postgres). I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows the answer to this, or is aware of some kind of resource or tutorial out there that focuses on the intersection of Django, postgres, and testing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Flimsy-Parfait5032"> /u/Flimsy-Parfait5032 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Finished a python tech degree with TeamTreehouse and then went on to do a course from Dennis Ivy on the django framework... Since then have built my own little project and launced it on heroku. Previous to this I was doing a FEWD course but decided that it wasn&#39;t really my forte.. I mean it would be alright to have to do a bit of it here and there if I was working on a team and noticed something wasn&#39;t jiving but ALL day long I would prefer not to be doing design.. My question is this.. I know we have all had imposture syndrome at some point.. I have been doing this off and on now learning for lets say a year and I am wondering where does one even look for a django job! Or how would you reccomend to start? Really and truly at this point I would love to do an internship and be a part of a team or work on a project with a community but every time I go looking for jobs or internships it seems not many people specify django in their posting...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I researched the suitable stack to use before working on the product idea in mind, some folks crucified Django while others praised it. But learning to know of some major tech coys using Django is some relief.</p> <p>We built a mentee meet mentor app for data &amp; AI folks purely on Django at the backend and it has been fun. Though I want to improve API response time in deployment, I&#39;m good outside that. <a href="https://semis.reispartechnologies.com/">https://semis.reispartechnologies.com/</a>. Mentors can host group sessions and share their profiles for folks to connect with them.</p> <p>Django at the backend is great, our app has evolved and will still do. Currently, we vet mentors before accepting. We are not there yet obviously, it&#39;s a learning experience for me. .

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been puzzled by something. Djapy just hit 19K downloads - not massive compared to DRF, but surprisingly high for a framework that started as my personal tool for rapid MVPs. This got me wondering: what are other developers seeing in it?</p> <p>Looking at the feedback (especially from a mechanical engineer who&#39;s using it for internal tools!) (<a href="https://github.com/Bishwas-py/djapy/issues/32">github issue convo</a>), I think I&#39;m starting to understand:</p> <pre><code># This is literally all you need for a typed, validated API endpoint @djapify def get_user(request, username: str) -&gt; {200: UserSchema, 404: MessageOut}: return User.objects.get(username=username) </code></pre> <p>For those who&#39;ve tried it, the appeal seems to be:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Build MVPs in Hours, Not Days</strong>: One developer went from idea to deployed internal tool in an afternoon.
