<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi.</p> <p>I want to use both Laravel and Django for my application. I want to have a shared database and tables accessible by both. I have kind of achieved it, by managing models, migrations etc. for all tables, except users table.</p> <p>According to my current understanding. - Laravel creates a users table with bcrypt to hash passwords.</p> <ul> <li><p>Django saves by default using PBKDF2, with some sequence of $&lt;algorithm&gt;$&lt;iterations&gt;$&lt;salt&gt;$$&lt;hash&gt;$</p></li> <li><p>I have added Django specific columns to users table, is_staff, is_superuser, timestamps etc.</p></li> </ul> <p>In Django I tried changing the hashing password method to bcrypt, but still it saves password differently.</p> <p>I tried with Custom Managers etc. along with changing the password saving format to just hash</p> <p>Any guidance is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pkdme"> /u/pkdme </a>

For the past 2.3 years, Iâ€™ve been working as a Python Django Developer cum Trainer. Most of my experience has been focused on teaching students and helping them with academic projects. While this has given me excellent communication skills and a solid grasp of Django concepts, I lack hands-on experience with live projects or working in a team environment. </p> <p>Iâ€™ve always dreamed of becoming a full-time developer, but teaching commitments held me back from pursuing that goal earlier. Recently, I decided to quit my job to focus on upskilling and finding a developer role as soon as possible. Iâ€™ve started exploring Django Rest Framework, React, and building projects to strengthen my profile. Iâ€™m also doing freelance teaching to stay financially stable during this transition. </p> <p>I have a few questions:<br/> 1. If I start as a freshe

Im using DRF with a frontend.</p> <p>I also have not done auth yet and im guessing i probably should even though i will attempt to handle this from the VPS too.</p> <p>Thanks in advanced</p> <p>Edit: Should i be implementing JWT so the frontend passes this to the apis?
