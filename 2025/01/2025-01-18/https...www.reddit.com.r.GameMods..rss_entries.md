<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking to get into making my own mods. However, the games I would like to mod (Luminous Avenger iX/iX2, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3) are made by Inti Creates using their own proprietary engine. Does anyone have any tools to help me out? I know games made in Unity or other engines have dev tools like BepInEx.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArmedBlue08"> /u/ArmedBlue08 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i49u6j/how_to_mod_inti_creates_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i49u6j/how_to_mod_inti_creates_games/">[comments]</a></span>
