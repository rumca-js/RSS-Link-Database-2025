## Den of Thieves (2018) is basically Heat for meatheads - but a really fun movie nonetheless

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Watched Den of Thieves, starring Gerard Butler, Pablo Schreiber and O&#39;Shea Jackson Jr, recently on an international flight. This is basically Heat&#39;s baby brother, where Heat is the sophisticated, mature older brother and Den of Thieves is the loud, brash, and dumb younger sibling. For DoT ostensibly is almost a greatest hits cover of Heat - a group of bank robbers ripping off joints in LA, and a band of cops gunning for them. But whereas Heat was more concerned with the innate complexities of the process, method and consequence of playing cops and robbers, DoT harbours no such lofty pretensions - it&#39;s more visceral and in your face, and more concerned with slick, in-the-moment action. </p> <p>That&#39;s really both the movie&#39;s strengths and weakness. Cause there really isn&#39;t much going on narratively speaking - there are some bank robber dudes, they are macho, tough and badass. There are some mildly corrupt cops, who are also mach

I feel they nerfed her in this movie. I don&#39;t mind Bridgette Wilson, even if she was miscast (Sandra Hess looked more apt but Wilson was a better actress).

## Among "The Sandlot's" many virtues, I really like how it doesn't go the "underdog team comes together to win championship" approach so prominent in the 90s. Indeed, it gleefully subverts that.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The 90s especially liked using that storyline in kids sports movies, in no small part thanks to the success of &quot;The Mighty Ducks.&quot; But &quot;The Sandlot&quot; has none of that, as the whole point of the titular baseball field is that the gang of friends who use it have an endless game that they play themselves with no organization save their own. There is no championship to win, it&#39;s just kids having fun. And while there is the subplot with the snobby Little League team midway through the film, it&#39;s just one of several episodes in the film&#39;s storyline and the film gleefully subverts the &quot;championship game&quot; by having it be a completely one-sided affair where the gang crushes the Little Leaguers (in no small part due to Ham&#39;s trash talking behind the plate). It&#39;s another way &quot;The Sandlot&quot; is such an endearing classic. Championship games are not nearly as important as saving the Baby Ruth ball from the B

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong><em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em></strong> is a fantastic book that was adapted into a highly acclaimed film in 1975. I like the story for two main reasons. First, it takes place in a psych ward, where one of the main characters has no reason to be there—i.e., he’s completely sane—but he chooses to be there. Second, it makes you reconsider the outward roles and appearances we wear—e.g., does the title of “Charge Nurse” mean you’re genuinely acting to help patients? Or are the patients we label as mentally ill actually any different in the way they think from the average person?</p> <p>The big question this book made me meditate on is what true freedom looks like and whether it is necessarily influenced by our outward circumstances.</p> <p>Before examining the theme more closely, I’ll do a brief summary of the book.</p> <p>Ken Kesey’s <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em> is set in a psychiatric hospital and narrated by Chief Bromden

I grew up on fast cuts and shaky cams before John Wick came to end them all. </p> <p>When I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger movies like Predator or Commando, where he is basically a machine dressed up to kill, I thought that is how every old action movie works. Explosions, cool one liners and fearless heroes. </p> <p>This is why Die Hard and Lethal Weapon surprised me quite a bit. John McClane is not one of those indestructible heroes. He does not shoot with infinite ammunition. Yes, he does some pretty wild stuff, like jumping from rooftops, but there is also a side of him that makes him very interesting. A touch humanity that is caught when he talks to the police officer or his wife. I like that very much. </p> <p>The same goes for Lethal Weapon.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We see that in Back to the Future Part II (1989), that old Biff Tannen steals the time machine and uses it to go back to 1955 and give the Sports Almanac to his younger self, introducing a new much darker timeline that significantly changes world history. The world presented to us in this alternate timeline could even be described as dystopian, which isn&#39;t surprising given the easter eggs we see in the film. We find out that in this timeline, the Vietnam War continues deep into the 1980s, and Richard Nixon isn&#39;t exposed in the Watergate Scandal (likely do to Biff who probably is friends with Nixon in this timeline), meaning Nixon abolishes that two term limit and continues to be president by 1985 (ala Watchmen).</p> <p>In the Escape From movies including Escape from New York (1981) and Escape from L.A (1996), we know that America seemingly goes right down the crapper for reasons never fully explained to us. We know that in 1988, the crime rat

## In Making the LOTR Trilogy Peter Jackson made almost all the right moves in hiring cast & crew. For me though one choice in particular stands out above the rest. Who would compose the music for this fantasy epic? No one could’ve predicted it, it was a bold, out of left field choice. Howard Shore.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Put yourself back circa 1999-2001. Lord of the Rings, out of all fantasy books, has a unique musical quality to it. Even in book form. Music is a major part of the books charm &amp; soul. So whoever was chosen as composer for the planned film trilogy, it would be a daunting task. Many names were floating around. James Horner was a popular choice. His music was heavily featured in the early trailers. Danny Elfman was another since he and PJ had worked together on PJ’s last film prior to Rings.</p> <p>This is a selection that Jackson MUST get right. So I imagine when Howard Shore was announced as composer for all 3 films there was a collective “Huh?”, “The Se7en guy? The David Cronenberg guy”?</p> <p>There was nothing in Shore’s resume that jumps out at you that’d he’d be right for this job. Even his “sound” didn’t seem to fit within the Middle Earth aesthetic. Surely James Horner would be the better choice? Or Hans Zimmer? Horner did Braveheart &amp;
