With his side leading 2-0 against Aston Villa thanks to goals from Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz, the Arsenal manager must have felt they were within touching distance of a cathartic victory.</p><p>But having seen leaders Liverpool seal a dramatic late victory over Brentford earlier in the afternoon, once again Unai Emery had other plans against his former club. Arteta could only watch on in horror as Youri Tielemans pulled one back before Ollie Watkins volleyed home the equaliser. Even when it seemed Arsenal might have won it late on through Mikel Merino, their joy was short-lived as VAR ruled Havertz had diverted the Spaniard\u2019s effort with his arm to ensure this was another two points dropped in their pursuit of Liverpool.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/18/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

The initial plan for his pre-season had been to spend some of his time sparring with Carlos Alcaraz at the Spaniard\u2019s home away from home at the Ferrero Tennis Academy in Villena, Alicante.</p><p>This was clearly an exciting prospect. Since one of his goals in the new year was to chase after Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, it was a perfect opportunity to see how one of the leading lights of the new era of men\u2019s tennis works behind the scenes and to refine his own game against the best.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/18/jack-draper-battles-five-setters-and-fitness-to-set-up-alcaraz-showdown\">Continue reading...</a>",

When Swiatek\u2019s game is flowing and her mind is clear, the combined quality of her violent ball-striking, athleticism and unrelenting focus is so great that, at some point or another, she has rendered nearly all of the best players in the world spectators in their own match.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon at Melbourne Park, it was Emma Raducanu\u2019s turn to endure such an unpleasant experience. Raducanu cut a lonely, solemn figure on one of the biggest tennis stadiums in the world as she was completely helpless in the face of a supreme Swiatek, who ruthlessly opened up her bakery to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open with a dominant 6-1, 6-0 win.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025",
