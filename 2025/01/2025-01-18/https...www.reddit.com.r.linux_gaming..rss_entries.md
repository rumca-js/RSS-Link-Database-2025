<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to get my SHH Shifter to work in games but it just doesn&#39;t get detected and nothing can be assigned to it. I&#39;ve tried it in both Assetto Corsa Evo and Assetto Corsa Competizione.</p> <p>The shifter gets detected (Shows up in dmesg, lsusb) and steam can see it and I can begin setting it up (It&#39;s asking me to press A, B, X, Y, etc). If I do this setup, enable steam input for generic controllers and enable steam input for the game. Then, I am able to map it in game but the buttons show up as generic gamepad buttons such as X, Y, A and B instead of a button dedicated to the controller like it does on windows.</p> <p>With steam input disabled for it, I can&#39;t bind it to anything. I tried it in multiple games and I had the same results.</p> <p>Has anyone gotten shifters to work on linux?

This can be a lifesaver if you&#39;re dealing with issues related to NVIDIA drivers or want to optimize your system setup.</p> <p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p> <p>Many people assume their iGPU is irrelevant because they have a dedicated GPU (dGPU), but in reality, you can leverage the iGPU for desktop use while reserving the dGPU for gaming.</p> <p><strong>Here’s how it can help:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Desktop Stability: Use the iGPU for general desktop tasks if you&#39;re experiencing instability with the NVIDIA drivers.</li> <li>Gaming Compatibility: Steam, Proton, and most game launchers on Linux automatically switch to the dGPU for gaming, so you won&#39;t sacrifice performance in your games.</li> <li>Power Efficiency: Offloading non-gaming

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey y&#39;all, recent Linux conversion here. Been running Mint on a NUC with a Ryzen 7 7840HS and using Parsec for gaming to connect to my &quot;main&quot; PC in my rack with Windows with a Ryzen 7 5800X and a 7900XT.</p> <p>The frame rate and delay have been fine, they&#39;re plugged into the same gigabit switch so that hasn&#39;t been an issue. But the graphical fidelity feels very lacking, I assume due to the bitrate limits of Parsec.</p> <p>My main question: How much hassle is it to run games natively on Linux vs Parsec into a Windows machine? I would say 95% of the games I play are semi-big titles (no super duper indie stuff to worry about weird driver support or anything), and Icarus is what has made me notice the graphics lacking. </p> <p>I do need a Windows machine for some apps like Affinity photo editor and Capcut, but would it be better to make the more powerful machine my Linux machine and use the NUC for Windows?

It can&#39;t map keys to axis at all from what I understand and half of mappings just don&#39;t work properly, A B X Y and SELECT work as expected, I think also either triggers or bumpers, but other do not. Playing a game just with ABXY is not impossible, but for all games I do want to play it&#39;s not enough.</p> <p>System: Arch Linux, KDE Plasma, Wayland</p> <p>What I need: A software that can remap keyboard buttons to virtual gamepad buttons.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On booting up steam in Ubuntu, I can see all my games that I already own. Great, check. </p> <p>When I select CS2 ( which I know is native ) I see a blue INSTALL button that it clickable. For games like The Finals, or Outer Wilds, the install button is greyed out. I can force the use of a compatibility tool and wallah, I can install now. Great check. All makes sense.</p> <p>Now here&#39;s the fun part: When I click on library games like POE2 and Marvel Rivals, I also see a blue install button that&#39;s clickable... And after investigating these aren&#39;t actually native, and have no forced compatibility tool in their properties... What makes certain windows games special, that I can directly install them, while other windows games I can&#39;t?? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mander1122"> /u/mander1122 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i3uvh7/new_to_stea
