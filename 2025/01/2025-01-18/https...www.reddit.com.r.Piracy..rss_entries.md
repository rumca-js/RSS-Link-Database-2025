Everyone remembers the heated seats fiasco BMW did and how people quickly hacked their system to enable (the previously inatalled and already in the vehicle) heated seats.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have used my android phone to cast to my xbox with SmartView for a few years now. I use sites that host the videos on them and just hit play but it tends to not play on a full screen. Need some tips for better quality casting. I&#39;ll download some apps but I won&#39;t torrent.</p> <p>Thank you,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LtDansLegs1"> /u/LtDansLegs1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1i3vzdw/phone_to_xbox_casting/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1i3vzdw/phone_to_xbox_casting/">[comments]</a></span>
