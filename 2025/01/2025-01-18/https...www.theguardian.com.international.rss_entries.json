The most famous actor of the 20th century told the then education secretary to put a book on her head and walk around to improve her deportment. He also advised her to take long confident strides, and to use her eyes to seduce and flirt.</p><p>The future prime minister went on to visit Olivier\u2019s house for a further five lessons, details of which are revealed in a new Radio 4 play, <em>When Maggie Met Larry</em>. Starring Derek Jacobi, who joined Olivier\u2019s fledgling National Theatre when only 24, and Frances Barber as Thatcher, the drama tells of the previously unknown advice on style and voice offered to the Tory politician.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/18/how-laurence-olivier-gave-margaret-thatcher-private-seduction-l",
