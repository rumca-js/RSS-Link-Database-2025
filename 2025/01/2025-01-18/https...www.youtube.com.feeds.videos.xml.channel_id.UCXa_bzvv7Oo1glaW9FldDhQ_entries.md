Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is undoubtedly worth playing in that it’s a good game still; but it seems to be far too overpriced for what it is, and the game having very changes made since its last re-release over a decade ago means that it doesn’t have as many modern quality of life features that can help it appeal to a more expanded audience. 

Simultaneously, it being the third release of the game, means that enthusiasts are unlikely to bite it, especially at that price and with those shortcomings.

It’s official: 2025 is the year of the video game sequel. Cutting this list down to 15 was immensely challenging given the wealth of exceptional follow-ups that’ll see the light of day this year and into next. 

The fact so many studios are releasing sequels this year is likely down to chance, but either way it could also prove to be a good thing to release something familiar, something known or anticipated, as the last couple of years have been brutal for those working in the industry. 

New ideas haven’t always translated into something meaningful, so lament the lack of something fresh all you like, fact is the barrage of sequels incoming is nothing short of positive.

Sony has cancelled two more games. Live service projects in development at Sony Bend and Bluepoint Games (with the latter reportedly being a God of War spinoff) have been shelved, with the company seemingly reassessing its live service push after the complete and disastrous failure of Concord. 

It is, of course, good that Sony seems to be backing away from its ambitious live service plans, given the fact that the company was clearly not equipped to actually implement them successfully. But at the same time, looking at this console generation, which has been marked with project cancellations, studio closures, widespread layoffs, and a bevy of controversial decisions by PlayStation, you can’t help but feel a little dejected at the current state of the company. 

Here, we discuss all of that and more.
