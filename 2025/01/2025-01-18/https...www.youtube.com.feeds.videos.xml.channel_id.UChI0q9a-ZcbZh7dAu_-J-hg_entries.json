        "description": "Elon Musk, despite holding accolades in a variety of industries and projects, has decided that he wants to be perceived as an elite \"Pro Gamer\" ... Just one problem though... he isn't one. \n\nAfter inflating his own ego with claims of being one of the worlds best Quake players (as far back as the 1990s) he is now embarrassing himself by fabricating Path of Exile 2 accomplishments, and twisting the authenticity of Diablo 4 speed runs, after becoming a widespread industry joke for the title of Elden Ring. \n\nHe may be the worlds richest businessman, but hes certainly one of the worlds most pathetic gamers.\n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nQuin69TVs Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmEe3eUPWq4&t=659s\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURI",
