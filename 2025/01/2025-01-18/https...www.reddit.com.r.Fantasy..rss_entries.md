<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This might sound like a bizarre question, but it’s just that I have been debating with myself on what works best when it comes to physical VS digital media regarding how I read my books as I have a tendency to switch between the two types.</p> <p>To start off with an example, I recently got Mistborn on a regular format as I got the standard edition on a physical copy, but I feel tempted to read the original novel through a Kindle device just to see if it’s easier to read the book on a digital format. Maybe I am just making a big deal out of this situation, but it’s just that I had to bring up this particular issue as I found it to be an interesting topic to discuss as sometimes I see people debating on how they like to access their media, and since this is a subreddit for discussing fantasy books in general, I was hoping to get some interesting answers regarding how readers like to access their media regarding the genre.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My favorite fantasy is often from the 80s/90s, due to the more “classic” style of prose back then.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you’re a fan of fantasy and you haven’t read Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Shadow of the Apt series yet, you’re missing out. It&#39;s got 10 books, military strategy, sword fights, steampunk vibes, and a ridiculously cool bug-inspired world. There&#39;s political intrigue, massive battles, character drama, advancing technology, even magic.</p> <p>So, without further ado, my review. Spoilers will be marked.</p> <p><strong>Why I loved it:</strong><br/> The first four books are absolutely the best. They tell a complete arc that had me hooked from start to finish. That being said, it&#39;s worth pushing on through and reading the whole series for a really rich epic fantasy story.</p> <p>Character wise, I loved Sten, Tynisa, Tisimon, but especially Cheerwell Maker. What I really loved about her is that she never abandons her principles. Her life goes to hell without the benefit of a handbasket and she still manages to cling to her collegiate principles.</p> <p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read this book in a single sitting today and thought it was excellently written. The descriptions of the wasteland’s nature made it come across as truly hellish and the companies’ greed made for an excellent villain, while the naturalist’s self-delusion was believable, but painful in a similar manner to Cersei’s POV in the later game of thrones books.</p> <p>That said, I absolutely hated the ending. Hell was unleashed onto the world, and the characters had become so changed that they no longer cared, including Marya, whose mission to find that the companies greed had caused this calamity didn’t prevent her being a similarly willing part of it. </p> <p>In terms of characters, that seems to make my perspective on the outcome to be most like the priest Petrov. Given he was characterised as an overly religious hypocrite throughout, that seems to be a case of disagreeing with the authors perspective perhaps? The alternative is that we are supposed to vi

I already got No Coincidence, which I believe is the only full length novel set in the same world as the game. I&#39;ve tried to read both Neuromancer and Snow Crash and they just don&#39;t scratch the itch that I have. What I&#39;m looking for is basically something like Red Rising or Sun Eater in that while they are sci-fi, they feel more like fantasy in the way they are executed. Neuromancer and Snow Crash feel more like traditional sci-fi which I am personally not the biggest fan of.

The author does a good job of laying out the whole story through the MC’s eyes, mind, innocence, brilliance, and strangeness.

It’s easily <strong>one of my favorite books</strong> over the last few years, and I read a <em>lot</em>.
