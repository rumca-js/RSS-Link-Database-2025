<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to have a Hello Kitty radio, in like 2010s? Anyways I used to play this cd in it, and I loved this song in it but I can&#39;t remember the name or any to most of the lyrics. This guy was singing about going to bed, and that everything would be okay in the morning, and there was a guitar playing. I remember him saying rest your little head? Some other songs on the CD were like, the three blind mice, give a dog a bone. Any help would be greatly appreciated. :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Moist_Counter_9377"> /u/Moist_Counter_9377 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i4hp0h/old_lullaby/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i4hp0h/old_lullaby/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like country, I don&#39;t listen to it. But I recently spent the day with a friend who had his radio tuned to a country music station. It was a long, quiet day so I paid more attention to the lyrics than I normally would, and it just kinda surprised me that alcohol as a topic came up more than any other theme. Plenty of songs were about nothing BUT drinking, but it comes up constantly in all sorts of songs. I simply found this normalization and glorification of alcohol strange, even though I drink alcohol myself and don&#39;t really object to it. Somewhat related, but country music culture is absolutely OBSESSED with self referential lyrics about a particular way of life. That&#39;s practically all it is. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/diceblue"> /u/diceblue </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i4fk4r/i_listened_to_country_music_for_hours_and_only_2/">[
