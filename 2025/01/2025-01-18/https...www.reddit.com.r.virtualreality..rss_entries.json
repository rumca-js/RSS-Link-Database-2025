If I\u2019m spending $1-2k for a headset, spending an extra $600 to get controllers working is crazy. </p> <p>I will say the design/functionality of the index controllers is chefs kiss. It\u2019s my favorite controller design wise. I get the knuckles mods for all my controllers bc I hate being forced to hold the controllers. </p> <p>Seems like the Pimax Dream Air will be the only option in the near future for a PCVR headset that\u2019s lightweight but also includes inside/out tracking. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_yung_spitta\"> /u/the_yung_spitta </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i3wky7/are_index_controllers_still_worth_it_in_2025/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtu",
