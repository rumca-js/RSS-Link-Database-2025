## Atari 7800 outsold Sega Master System by a factor of roughly 2:1 in North America according to various sources (3.7mil vs 1.5-2mil respectively). Why do I so often hear people say the opposite?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this is a fairly esoteric topic but I figure this is the place to talk about it. I read and watch a lot of retro gaming content. When I‚Äôm at home I usually have some kind of retro gaming video playlist going in the background. In videos about the 3rd generation of consoles I‚Äôve heard a number of Youtube commentators talk about the Atari 7800 being a sales disaster vs the Master System, including in North America. </p> <p>Obviously the Master System significantly surpassed the 7800 in terms of overall <em>global</em> sales but it quite clearly lost out to the 7800 on Atari‚Äôs home turf. I just find it a little odd that this fact somehow hasn‚Äôt made it into the overall narrative surrounding this generation of consoles <em>at all</em>. It‚Äôs almost universally ignored in favor of dismissing and ridiculing the 7800 as a total failure. Naturally it was no NES sales wise but it firmly came in second place in NA, distant though it may be.</p> <p>Do you

Games will freeze up, and the unit cycles off, and sometimes won&#39;t even start. I just don&#39;t see me paying to have it recapped and repaired. I have been seeing for several years 3rd party devices claiming to be able to play retro game cartridges ranging from NES, SNES, and Sega and often &quot;3-in-one&quot; options. What are the opinions of these and are there suggestions of devices? I&#39;ve built a Retro-Pie device, but as I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all discovered good ROMs are hard to come by. Plus I have a collection of games still playable as cartridges. TIA.</p> <p>Side Note: During searches I&#39;m seeing where there&#39;s controversy in the emulation world. Of all things... I have nothing against emulation and have done so. I just like the physical so

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was born in the early 90s. My dad had an old pc prior to windows 95. I know we had the original Duke nukem game. I remeber the crptic typing run_whatever.exe.</p> <p>This game you were trapped on an island. You could type commands. I remeber typing bad words and the game would be like don&#39;t say that. I remeber getting captured by tribal people and put in a prison. I used to be super stumped playing that one. And I can&#39;t find it anywhere. I wanna tackle it as a 30 yr old lol.</p> <p>Please help </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InverseCramer101"> /u/InverseCramer101 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i3vu3a/trying_to_remeber_the_name_of_an_old_ms_dos_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i3vu3a/trying_to_remeber_the_name_of_an_old_ms_dos_or/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve been looking up and down for a way to stream my retro consoles, specifically PlayStation 2 and original Xbox. I would prefer something that isn‚Äôt a million dollars for temporary use as well as recommendations for when I have the expendable income to make it look really nice. So basically can I get a specturm of products ranging from simple and cheap to expensive and complicated, so I know where to start and what to build towards. Right now anything will do that let‚Äôs me play old games on stream. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TrashoBaggins"> /u/TrashoBaggins </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i3vrh4/best_way_to_stream_retro_consoles/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i3vrh4/best_way_to_stream_retro_consoles/">[comments]</a></span>
