I tried searching with videos but there&#39;s nothing there...plus I&#39;m thinking maybe it&#39;s different in the repack. Any helpful comment is appreciated.

I successfully installed it, but for some reason, it won&#39;t start.</p> <p>I have already tried the following troubleshooting steps:</p> <ul> <li>Running the game in compatibility mode</li> <li>Running it as an administrator</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, none of these worked. Here are the specifications of my PC:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Operating System</strong>: Windows 11 Pro (24H2)</li> <li><strong>Driver</strong>: Latest AMD driver (24.9.1)</li> <li><strong>CPU</strong>: Ryzen 5 Pro 4650G</li> <li><strong>GPU</strong>: RX 580 8GB</li> <li><strong>Storage</strong>: HDD 1TB (where the game is installed)</li> <li><strong>RAM</strong>: 16GB DDR4 (3200MHz)</li> </ul> <p>I don’t think the issue is with the HDD, as other games installed on the same drive work perfectly fine.</p> <p>Do you have any suggestions or fixes for this
