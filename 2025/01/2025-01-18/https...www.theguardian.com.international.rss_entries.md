<p>Irish drag performer and LGBTQ+ activist Rory O’Neill AKA Panti Bliss on Beyoncé, why Australia is so annoying about coffee, and pestering Madonna for a lift</p><p><strong>What’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?</strong></p><p>There’s a saying that I first heard said by RuPaul: what other people think of you is none of your business. That is something that has helped me loads over the years. I get a lot of shit from the far right and I think it could have bothered me a lot more at times if I didn’t remind myself of that saying. And I like it because it’s not saying “ignore what other people say”; it’s almost giving you a telling off – it’s just <em>none of your business</em>. I think it makes it much easier to move through the world and not give a shit what other people think.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/19/panti-bliss-the-gays-will-never-forgive-me-for-that">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Harlequins 24-7 Glasgow</li><li>Cunningham-South scores first of three Quins tries</li></ul><p>A Champions Cup of modest returns for the English was at least given a fillip by Harlequins. This reasonably comfortable win over Glasgow across the road, from where the Calcutta Cup will be contested next month, put the home team through to the last 16. No one will particularly relish a visit from one of the game’s more waspish teams, but it is fair to say any further progress by Quins will require an improvement on this.</p><p>Glasgow, champions of the United Rugby Championship, no less were not quite there all evening. Perhaps they were thrown by loss of Sione Tuipulotu to a suspected pectoral injury this week in training, which threatens his participation in Scotland’s Six Nations campaign.

<p>Eight minutes of nonsense have all but put paid to manager’s title dreams after draw with Aston Villa</p><p>Mikel Arteta dropped to his haunches, laid his hand on his brow and let his head slump. When he looked up again, he had his thumb and forefinger to his eyes. It was the fifth minute of injury time, Leandro Trossard had just rolled a shot wide and Arsenal’s final chance had vanished. With it, perhaps, so had their hopes of winning the league. At the very least, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/15/arsenal-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">gains of Wednesday were handed back</a>.</p><p>As it turned out Trossard, who had been Arsenal’s most dangerous forward, may have been a fraction offside anyway, which perhaps would have been the most fitting conclusion.

<p>Improbable hype around the Ipswich forward is growing as he faces the club that reared and discarded him</p><p>This season: one of the best strikers in the Premier League. Last season: not in the Premier League, and if we’re being honest not even really a striker. Kieran McKenna remembers Liam Delap coming to Portman Road with Hull late 2023 and starting on the right wing: trying to use his pace to beat the offside trap, trying to get in behind and fashion chances for Aaron Connolly, and mostly failing to do either. Hull lost 3-0.</p><p>The blooming of Delap for Ipswich under McKenna has been one of the unlikelier underdog yarns of recent months. Until recently, this was another young, gifted age-group forward whose career appeared to be meandering towards frustration, another item of floating big-club debris trying to pick up whatever scraps were left on the table. We’ve seen this film before. It ends with a series of unsatisfying Championship loans, three moderately successful s

<p>The Brentford fans ought to have known better. After all, Darwin Núñez had scored a fabulous goal against their team in the corresponding fixture here last season. Still, when Núñez entered as a 65th minute substitute, they were ready with their taunt, one that compared him unfavourably to his one-time Liverpool predecessor, Andy Carroll.</p><p>Núñez had travelled to London having scored only four times all season. The scrutiny burned. It was no kind of return for an £85m record signing. Arne Slot had insisted he would come good, that it was simply a matter of getting him into the right spaces and situations against deep-set opponents. How it would work out at the very end for Núñez and Liverpool.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/18/brentford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Mateta at the double as Crystal Palace cruise to win against 10-man West Ham

<p>The sound of boos ringing out at the London Stadium has not taken long to return. This was a miserable afternoon for Graham Potter, whose side finished with 10 men and failed to register a shot on target during this deserved defeat to Crystal Palace, and it will surely intensify West Ham’s efforts to sign a new forward this month.</p><p>Palace are unlikely to have an easier clean sheet. Dean Henderson had nothing to do in goal and Oliver Glasner’s side were able to assume a tight grip from start to finish. Jean-Philippe Mateta, with his 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> goals of the season, produced the finishes that saw Palace move above West Ham and stretch their unbeaten run on the road to seven games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/18/west-ham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Seeing double: mirrors in art – in pictures

<p>From Rubens to <a href="https://www.junocalypso.com/">Juno Calypso</a> to <a href="https://yayoi-kusama.jp/e/information/">Yayoi Kusama</a> , artists have long been drawn to mirrors’ reflective surfaces. More than 150 artworks have been collected in a new book, drawing together sculptures, paintings, installations, photographs and more. “Historically, a mirror in a painting was a lens into another world or visual space,” says the book’s author, artist Michael Petry. “They also allowed artists to show the viewer more than one view point at a time, suggesting the complexity of our world and our relationship to it.” Self-portraits, and increasingly selfies, are a recurring theme. “It is clear that as humans, we are amazingly interested in our own image. It could be mere vanity but also I think mirrors show us the passage of time etched on our faces.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://thamesandhudson.com/mirrormirror-the-reflective-surface-in-contemporary-art-9780500026205">MirrorMirror

<p>From a ‘starter’ of dishing out compliments to a ‘dessert’ of smashing laptops in rage rooms, scientists and authors share 15 ‘portion-sized’ ideas for a positivity boost</p><p>Dopamine has a reputation as the body’s “feelgood” hormone, but it’s “really more about motivation than about positive affect”, says happiness researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky. This is the chemical that nudges you towards things you enjoy, helping you muster the effort required to attend a party you’re on the fence about, then showering you with a sense of reward when you actually have a great time. Dopamine works with other neurotransmitters like serotonin to give you a sense of momentum: do one thing to give yourself a mood boost, and the cascading effects of that decision can help you break out of a rut and resuscitate your zest for life. January, with its clean slate, is the ideal time to rev this process up.</p><p>Enter the concept of the dopamine menu: a fresh sheet of stimulating activities designed to l
