However, my tastes differ from the mainstream somewhat. Can anyone recommend a few booktubers to follow that would be a good fit? I really like literary fiction, like some epic/magic fantasy here and there (like LOTR, GOT, Harry potter - I do not like romantasy) I dislike YA - I read the first book of a court of thrones and roses and didn&#39;t like it very much). Romance as a genre generally isn&#39;t my thing, but I don&#39;t mind romance in books. Thrillers are okay, but I generally prefer character driven literature over plot. So I generally steer away from mysteries. </p> <p>Favorite books: The red tent A man called ove The time in between</p> <p>Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/the_ranch_gal\"> /u/the_ranch_gal </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i49ws9/booktube_w",

In total, I\u2019ve read 31 books from 13 series in 2024. </p> <p>And since I\u2019ve read so much sci-fi in a relatively short time, I thought it\u2019d be fun for me to summarize my reading year and review each book/series I\u2019ve read. Hopefully some of you will find it helpful when searching for some sci-fi to read. </p> <p>I\u2019ve tried to get a good collection of classical and modern titles included, as well as some non-western works. I\u2019ll try to avoid spoilers; however, I consider a book\u2019s main premise and plot points that could be on the back cover fair game - so if you want to go into these books completely blind, don\u2019t read further. </p> <p>So here are my reviews (in reading order): </p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dune (Frank Herbert), up to Child",
