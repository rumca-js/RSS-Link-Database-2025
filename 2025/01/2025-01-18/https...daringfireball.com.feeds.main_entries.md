<p>Tim Hardwick, last week for MacRumors, “Apple Smart Home Hub Launch Possibly Delayed Until Later in Year”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s long-rumoured smart home hub or “command center” may not
arrive in the spring as previously expected, according to
Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. [...]</p>

<p>Apple originally planned to introduce the home hub in March 2025.
However, writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-12/apple-2025-plans-iphone-17-smart-home-hub-ios-19-ai-apple-watch-ipads-m5">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman
says that the device “may take longer to reach consumers,” owing

<p>Joanna Stern, in her weekly Tech Things newsletter for the WSJ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite what my iPhone’s frequent notification summaries report,
my husband isn’t messy, he isn’t sad and he <em>definitely</em> didn’t
take out the garbage — because, again, I don’t have one. Wife?
Yes. Husband? No.</p>

<p><a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-sjrttn-dykjyuhruh-t/">As part of Apple Intelligence</a>, the company rolled out
these AI-powered summaries. Instead of scrolling through a
mountain of missed alerts, you get little condensed summaries,
grouped by app. Great concept, not quite “intelligent” execution.</p>
