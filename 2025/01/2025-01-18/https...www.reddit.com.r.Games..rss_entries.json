But once the world opened up, the gameplay - with many mandatory tasks rather than just a linear string of narrative missions - made the game a repetitive drag that I couldn&#39;t bother finishing. I was always ambivalent to Mafia 1/2 gameplay since I played them many years after playing other open-world games (GTA, Saint&",

This meant that I spent a lot of boring time grinding using enemies that didn&#39;t yield much exp or money, then faced no challenge once I got to the boss. This may have been connected to the common thing people do where they try to hold onto every item they get. I might not have wanted to use my patients and such. </p> <p>Now I try to beat bosses at a slightly low level as a challenge, and if I can&#39;t, I use grinding with a goal which makes it more fun. And also most jrpgs give you more options later into the game. For instance, early game grinding might literally just be for exp, but later on you have cool stuff you can buy, extra systems like Materia and Job points, etc..</p> <p>What are some ways you approached games that bettered your enjoyment of them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",
