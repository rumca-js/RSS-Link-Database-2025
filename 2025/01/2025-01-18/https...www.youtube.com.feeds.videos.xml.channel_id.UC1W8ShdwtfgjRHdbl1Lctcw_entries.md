I used a new colorization technique, restored and applied face restoration, and created a sound design for this rare video showcasing Copenhagen, Denmark in the late 1930s. The footage captures vibrant scenes of street life outside "Prwatbanken," bustling with bicycles, cars, horse-drawn carts, and modern apartment blocks,  Busy streets near City Hall reveal lively intersections filled with bicyclists, automobiles, and pedestrians, while Copenhagen's main square showcases the city's energetic rhythm. The video also features a serene view of the canal with the Nicolai Church tower in the background, the charming Nyborgade street, and close-ups of Christiansborg Palace, the seat of Parliament and the Foreign Ministry, including a long shot of its grand entrance, the Shell Centralen petrol building.
