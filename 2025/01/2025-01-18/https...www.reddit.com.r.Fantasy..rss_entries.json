Spoilers will be marked.</p> <p><strong>Why I loved it:</strong><br/> The first four books are absolutely the best. They tell a complete arc that had me hooked from start to finish. That being said, it&#39;s worth pushing on through and reading the whole series for a really rich epic fantasy story.</p> <p>Character wise, I loved Sten, Tynisa, Tisimon, but especially Cheerwell Maker. What I really loved about her is that she never abandons her principles. Her life goes to hell without the benefit of a handbasket and she still manages to cling to her collegiate principles.</p> <p>",

The descriptions of the wasteland\u2019s nature made it come across as truly hellish and the companies\u2019 greed made for an excellent villain, while the naturalist\u2019s self-delusion was believable, but painful in a similar manner to Cersei\u2019s POV in the later game of thrones books.</p> <p>That said, I absolutely hated the ending. Hell was unleashed onto the world, and the characters had become so changed that they no longer cared, including Marya, whose mission to find that the companies greed had caused this calamity didn\u2019t prevent her being a similarly willing part of it. </p> <p>In terms of characters, that seems to make my perspective on the outcome to be most like the priest Petrov.

I already got No Coincidence, which I believe is the only full length novel set in the same world as the game. I&#39;ve tried to read both Neuromancer and Snow Crash and they just don&#39;t scratch the itch that I have. What I&#39;m looking for is basically something like Red Rising or Sun Eater in that while they are sci-fi, they feel more like fantasy in the way they are executed. Neuromancer and Snow Crash feel more like traditional sci-fi which I am personally not the biggest fan of.
