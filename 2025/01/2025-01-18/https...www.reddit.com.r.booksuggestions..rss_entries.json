Over the last few weeks i&#39;ve found myself really interested in the history of humanity, from the times of our earliest ancestors in Africa all the way to modern humans. I know a lot of our history is unknown and a lot of it is also just lost entirely, but does anyone know of any books covering a good portion of our history? I would love to have a timetable of our discoveries and expansion all in a book/series if such a book exists.

I really enjoyed American Psycho (not that it relates to this) and I like more contemporary books. My favorite books are those reminiscent of the \u201cindie sleaze\u201d aesthetic with gritty, edgy, and urban vibes, similar to the feel of indie films or music. Any recommendations for books that embody this raw, underground aesthetic would be greatly appreciated. I also like weirder things too like the Diary of an Oxygen Thief.

A job I\u2019d hope for since I was 13 or 14. On paper my life is pretty great. However, things aren\u2019t panning out as I expected. I\u2019m the weakest link in my team and despite me trying my hardest and having a good attitude to improve, others consistently outperform me. It\u2019s been quite depressive to hope and work for a dream my entire adult life and not being good at it. My wife and kids have also devoted a lot to my career. My wife also has a great career she loves and put on hold for the time being and my toxic work environment/friends is effecting her mood as well. I need something to get me through at least our busy season (next 6-8months). Something that can get me (and maybe my wife) out of this lull of feeling like a failure and inadequate.

Haunted mansions, restless ghosts, dark cemeteries, maybe even a mummy or vampire-those are the vibes I&#39;m after. I&#39;m open to both modern and older books, as long as they really capture that timeless horror feel.</p> <p>For reference: \u2022 I loved Dracula, Frankenstein, The Haunting of Hill House, and most of Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s works.

Afterwards I also plan to get into the Hobbit and the Silmarillion, since I love the lore and world-building! (Meaning I&#39;ll have my hands full for now)</p> <p>Does anyone maybe have any suggestions? I&#39;m a bit unsure what else to read once I&#39;m done with these books (Which will obviously take a while). I&#39;m generally open to a lot of stuff; Fantasy, sci-fi, horror, even dystopian novels are good. I&#39;m just a bit out of touch with specific genres and Authors I guess. Though I have to say, I&#39;m not that much into books that deal primarily with romance.</p> <p>Any suggestion would be appreciated!

But once I hit high school, I kind of fell out of the habit. (I guess now would be a good time to mention I have pretty bad ADHD and I think that\u2019s a big contributing factor) </p> <p>I would love to get back into reading, but I get so distracted. I have no idea where to start, so I\u2019m hoping for some help here. My favourite genre right now is true crime, science fiction, and horror. I need something that will really grab me from the beginning. </p> <p>I would love some suggestions.
