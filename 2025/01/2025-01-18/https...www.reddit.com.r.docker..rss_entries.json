        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello! Definitely a newbie here trying to dive in but having some roadblocks. Currently I have a Rasp Pi 5 with Docker installed and set up. However, I intend on having the Pi be headless, and remote in with my main Windows machine. Is there an easy way to access the Docker Engine running on the Pi from my Windows machine, without using either VNC or SSH on the command line? Both are doable, but VNC is clunky and ideally I don&#39;t want to have to use it on a regular basis, and currently I don&#39;t have the confidence with CLI to do EVERYthing while at the same time I&#39;m learning how to set up containers, opening them to LAN, etc.</p> <p>Google has been failing me on trying to find a guide or other post regarding this specific issue. Does anyone here have advice, or can point me to an appropriate guide? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deltaflip\"> /u/deltaflip </a> <br/> <span><a href",
