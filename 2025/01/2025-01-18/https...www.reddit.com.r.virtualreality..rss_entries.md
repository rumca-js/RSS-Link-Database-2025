<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really want PCVR to work, guys! Mainly so I can access native VR games on Steam and for Skyrim VR of course. I&#39;m having an issue in any game, whether performance heavy or not. When I physically turn my head, It&#39;s like it takes a while for the VR world to catch up. I get black borders and stuttering around the edges of the scene.</p> <p>Sometimes it blanks out to the Steam VR void totally and takes it a second to even show the game again.</p> <p>I&#39;m still working on modded Skyrim VR in general so I know that one is a performance eater, but I was surprised to see that I have this issue occasionally on other simpler games, like I Expect You To Die. Granted, it happens WAY WAY less than Skyrim.</p> <p><strong>Headset:</strong> Quest 3</p> <p><strong>Connection:</strong> PrismXR Puppis S1 on PrismPulse mode.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My partner owns a Quest 2, has had it since pre-meta. Now we are trying to move away from anything meta affiliated. He loves his headset so I was hoping that thereâ€™s some way to mod it so it runs off a different OS that isnâ€™t affiliated with meta. Maybe a custom OS or the OS of a different VR company? I do have experience with modding more traditional consoles to run off custom software so while VR modding is new to me, modding itself isnâ€™t. We wonâ€™t be getting rid of it anyways even if this isnâ€™t possible since itâ€™s still functional, just buying from a different brand once itâ€™s either broken or obsolete. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gracoy"> /u/gracoy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i3zci6/quest_2_is_there_a_way_to_change_the_os/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i3zci6/quest_2_is_there_a_way_

## Are Index Controllers still worth it in 2025?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really want to upgrade to something like the Bigscreen Beyond of MeganeX 8k, but the set up/ cost of index controllers + base stations is a huge turn off for me. If Iâ€™m spending $1-2k for a headset, spending an extra $600 to get controllers working is crazy. </p> <p>I will say the design/functionality of the index controllers is chefs kiss. Itâ€™s my favorite controller design wise. I get the knuckles mods for all my controllers bc I hate being forced to hold the controllers. </p> <p>Seems like the Pimax Dream Air will be the only option in the near future for a PCVR headset thatâ€™s lightweight but also includes inside/out tracking. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the_yung_spitta"> /u/the_yung_spitta </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i3wky7/are_index_controllers_still_worth_it_in_2025/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtu
