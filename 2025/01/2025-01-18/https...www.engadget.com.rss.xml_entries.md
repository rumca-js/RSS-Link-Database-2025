<p>Amazon&#39;s drones won&#39;t be making any deliveries in the foreseeable future. According to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-17/amazon-pauses-drone-deliveries-after-aircraft-crashed-in-rain"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has paused all commercial drone deliveries in Texas and Arizona after a previously undisclosed event in which two of Amazon&#39;s MK30 drones had crashed at the Pendleton, Oregon airport it uses for testing. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-next-gen-prime-air-delivery-drone-103003910.html">MK30</a> is the company&#39;s next-gen drone model, which is lighter and has a longer range than its predecessor, the MK27. The incidents took place in December, with one of the drones even catching fire after it fell. Amazon reportedly determined that its drones crashed due a software issue that&#39;s linked to the light rain drizzling at the time the tests were being conducted.&nbsp;</p>
