<p>As Mikel Arteta knows only too well, it can only take the finest of margins to settle a Premier League title race. With his side leading 2-0 against Aston Villa thanks to goals from Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz, the Arsenal manager must have felt they were within touching distance of a cathartic victory.</p><p>But having seen leaders Liverpool seal a dramatic late victory over Brentford earlier in the afternoon, once again Unai Emery had other plans against his former club. Arteta could only watch on in horror as Youri Tielemans pulled one back before Ollie Watkins volleyed home the equaliser. Even when it seemed Arsenal might have won it late on through Mikel Merino, their joy was short-lived as VAR ruled Havertz had diverted the Spaniard’s effort with his arm to ensure this was another two points dropped in their pursuit of Liverpool.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/18/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emile Smith Rowe and Adama Traoré struck in the second half as Fulham inflicted a seventh successive Premier League defeat on Leicester. The hosts provided another solid first-half showing but ultimately paid the price for a lack of quality and failed to learn their lessons from their midweek second-half <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/15/leicester-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report">collapse to Crystal Palace</a> in a similar display in front of their own fans.</p><p>Their defensive fragility showed after the interval and they conceded early for the second time in the space of a week courtesy of Smith-Rowe’s fourth goal of the campaign.

<p>Second world war deserters upset the lives of an isolated mountain community in this outstanding second feature from Maura Delpero</p><p>The year is 1944. But the remote Italian Alpine village of Vermiglio is a place of timeless rhythms and rituals, unchanged for centuries. There’s a precarious poetry to life in this ice-bound little community: the clear, widescreen drama of the backdrop is a contrast to the darker reality of a brutally high infant mortality rate and perpetual gnawing hunger. It’s a world away from the war consuming the rest of Europe. But then the ragged edges of combat finally reach the mountain: two deserters – Attilio (Santiago Fondevila), a son of the village, and Pietro (Giuseppe De Domenico), a stranger from Sicily – take shelter within the community. Lucia (Martina Scrinzi), the oldest daughter of the stern village teacher, is drawn to the stranger, and a tentative romance blossoms into marriage. But their union sets in motion a string of devastating conse

The initial plan for his pre-season had been to spend some of his time sparring with Carlos Alcaraz at the Spaniard’s home away from home at the Ferrero Tennis Academy in Villena, Alicante.</p><p>This was clearly an exciting prospect.

<p>I didn’t remember committing my crime but I knew I had fallen through the cracks of the system. Could prison really be my salvation?</p><p>Sixteen months ago, I somehow found myself standing bewildered in the dock of a magistrates court, at my own bail hearing for attempted armed robbery, wondering if I was really there or not. I had inexplicably gone into a shop with a toy gun at 7.30am, pointed it at the cashier and screamed at him for money while in a psychotic, delusional state. In my mind, I hadn’t committed a crime at all; I was merely acting out a scene from a film. Legally I had committed a Schedule 15 offence – a list that includes kidnapping, sex offences, manslaughter and soliciting murder, grave crimes that can result in a maximum of 14 years’ custody. Bail wasn’t even considered, as the magistrate believed I underestimated the seriousness of my crime, didn’t think I’d surrender to my bail conditions and saw me as a flight risk. I don’t know if he banged a gavel or not

<p>Somewhere between protein powders and chicken breasts in plastic containers, I fear the pursuit of wellness has become a thief of joy</p><p>Last year, I needed to eat on the go between exercising and an evening class. Frequently, I would find myself striding up a hill in the dark eating cold boiled eggs from a plastic pot. The eggs had been cooked into submission, with a grey ring around the chalky yolk that plastered itself across my tongue and teeth. The whites were rubbery, and the bottom of the pot held a little pool of mysterious cloudy water that made me shudder.</p><p>So why choose to eat the cursed eggs?

According to her friend, the musician and neuroscientist Daniel Levitin, “when she got back from the hospital, she couldn’t walk and she couldn’t talk, and the doctors were so pessimistic about her recovery, they hadn’t scheduled any follow-ups”. For a while it looked as though&nbsp;one of the most gifted&nbsp;songwriters of the 20th&nbsp;century would be permanently silenced.</p><p>One day, though, the nurses caring for her at her home found Levitin’s number on a piece of paper in the kitchen, and called him. They had noticed that Mitchell perked up when she heard music coming from their phones, and wondered if he had any suggestions for songs she might respond to. Remarkably, he’d helped her compile a CD of her favourite t

I imagine it’s for this reason that shortbread is often paired with sharp and creamy posset, a smooth set cream and citrus dessert on which today’s mousse is based. The fennel seed, with its sweet, green flavour, acts as an excellent chaperone, helping to ease any tension between mousse and shortbread.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/18/vegan-lemon-mousse-with-fennel-seed-shortbread-recipe-meera-so
