<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So in one of my classes at school, there&#39;s a girl I like. The teacher said that if anyone wants to pick their seats in class, they can with a Google form. And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a coincidence but I&#39;m sitting with her. I want to know if she picked me so I can figure out if she likes me. Is there a way for me to see her response on a Google form without needing her account. If anyone can help me, please do in any way possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JesusAndGodLover777"> /u/JesusAndGodLover777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i3vefh/help_me_hack_in_the_name_of_love/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1i3vefh/help_me_hack_in_the_name_of_love/">[comments]</a></span>
