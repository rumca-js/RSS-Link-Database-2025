There are few who can claim to be deserving of a brand new adjective but David Lynch was certainly one of them. A truly unique artist whose work was dark and strange and surreal and funny all in equal measure, his influences came from a place that may not exist anymore, and at some point he became the influence himself. While films will forever strive to be “Lynchian” we can be sure we’ll never see an artist quite like David Lynch again.

In this episode of IGN Rewind, we dive into how the missteps of the Wii's successor paved the way for the creation of one of the best-selling consoles of all time—the Nintendo Switch.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is officially announced and perhaps the biggest surprise, is that it isn't very surprising at all. From the form to function, this is very much a bigger, more powerful Switch and that's a good thing.

In today's Daily Fix:
Sony has canceled a couple more games, both of which were live service titles. One of them was a God of War multiplayer game, and the other was an unannounced game from Bluepoint. Looks like Sony could be scaling back their live service push in the wake of the colossal failure of Concord. In other news, the devs behind Hollow Knight: Silksong potentially teased...something. A cryptic tweet involving a dessert profile picture have lead some to believe a Silksong announcement is coming with Nintendo's big Switch 2 Direct in April. And finally there's a new Steam Deck, only you can't buy it and it would probably be bad to play games on. To celebrate Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Steam Deck verification, Square Enix showed off a chocobo-themed Steam Deck complete with chocobo fur. Not the best way to play a handheld that can get very without the extra sweater.
