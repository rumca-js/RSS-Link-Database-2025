Today&#39;s paper is titled &quot;Advice for Diabetes Self-Management by ChatGPT Models: Challenges and Recommendations&quot; by Waqar Hussain and John Grundy.</p> <p>This paper evaluates the advice provided by ChatGPT models (versions 3.5 and 4) in response to diabetes-related queries. It uncovers substantial challenges associated with these models in providing accurate and practical advice for diabetes self-management. The study assesses the medical knowledge and personalized advisory capacity of these models, uncovering discrepancies in accuracy and biases that pose risks to effective diabetes management.</p> <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Accuracy and Bias Concerns</strong>: The study fo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We are working on a Decentralized Multi-agent Framework called Ceylon. In this framework, we decided to decouple LLMs from the core system. I have validated our ideas as follows. I would like to hear from you to get more suggestions and ideas for further developments.</p> <p>In recent months, we&#39;ve observed a growing trend in the AI community where Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being treated as a mandatory component of agent systems. While LLMs offer powerful capabilities, we believe this assumption needs careful examination. This article explains our strategic decision to decouple LLM support from our core agent library and why this architectural choice matters for the future of agent-based systems.</p> <h2>The Current Landscape</h2> <p>In today&#39;s AI landscape, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become so dominant that there&#39;s a growing assumption that all intelligent agents must be LLM-powered.
