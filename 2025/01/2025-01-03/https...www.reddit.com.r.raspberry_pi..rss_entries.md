<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am attempting to setup a nextcloud manager on my pi5. Nextcloud is installed but the www-data user cannot write to the ntsc drive. I have been trying to edit the permissions but I canâ€™t. I have tried editing the jstab file. I have tried adding udev rules. I am trying to manually mount with ntsc-3g but it always gets over ridden by fuseblk and set to root access. I do not know what else to try. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pensulpusher"> /u/pensulpusher </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hsymnm/ntsc_drive_access_for_nextcloud_manager/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hsymnm/ntsc_drive_access_for_nextcloud_manager/">[comments]</a></span>

## Is there a way to install Node.js on Raspberry PI Zero V1? (ARMV6)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know how to install nodejs, and I was able to install it on the raspi, but got an <code>Illegal Instruction</code> error, most likely because the distribution is only for ARMV7. I am now trying to compile it directly on the raspi, but this has a few problems. First, I will also have to compile <code>npm</code>, but more importantly, just <code>git clone</code> on that repo took 30 minutes so far. The compilation could take many hours.</p> <p>So I was wondering if I missed something. Or if someone has an idea on compiling both node and npm on some other machine. Anything I found on the internet was either outdated or &quot;just do <code>apt-get install</code>&quot; which I already tried.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MXXIV666"> /u/MXXIV666 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1hsm5f9/is_there_a_way_to_install_nodejs_on_raspberry_pi/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>Probably a stupid question, but...</p> <p>The Pi Zero 2 W only has one usb port, when connecting a bluetooth dongle, I have one question :</p> <p>For example, I connect a bluetooth dongle and start up the Pi Zero 2 W, with for example Batocera installed. How am I supposed to connect anything to it ? Because to be able to connect anything through bluetooth, you would have to go into the bluetooth menu. And with the bluetooth dongle connected, it overwrites/disables the internal bluetooth, so any controller working with the internal bluetooth before connecting the dongle wouldn&#39;t work anymore with the dongle connected.</p> <p>So how can this dongle be used ?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m about to build a raspberry pi cluster. As of right now, the plan is to have 2-3 Raspberry Pi Zero 2Ws and 1 Raspberry Pi 5. My main dilemma is whether or not I should get 4GB of RAM or 8GB. The cluster will be used for the following:</p> <ol> <li>Learning how to make a case for the cluster (I&#39;m super excited for this part)</li> <li>PiHole</li> <li>Discord bot(s)</li> <li>Self hosted webserver</li> <li>Linux VMs to mess around in (strong MAYBE)</li> <li>NAS (don&#39;t really need it, nice to have)</li> </ol> <p>As of right now, the plan is to have 1 of the Pi zeros acting as a master node. That will be running a web server of sorts that will routinely monitor the other PIs, making sure they&#39;re online, and will be managing things inside the case as well such as a fan and a status display. The remaining worker nodes (1-2 zeros and 1 pi 5) will be used to make sure the discord bot(s) don&#39;t go down (my friends like to spam a lot...
