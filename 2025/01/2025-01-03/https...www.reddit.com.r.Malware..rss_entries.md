<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, i play a lot off call of dutty on pc, but some off the old ones have some RCE exploits (Remote Code Execution), and i would like to keep playing without hackers being able to rat me, so i was wondering if a VM could be the answer to my problems. If i had a VM and eventually got hacked would the hack be limited to the VM ?</p> <p>Also in a question off perfermonce, is it the same as playing in the native system ?</p> <p>Could i also buy another SSD just for that instead off a VM, if performance is bad, and if so could i have a kind off dual boot off 2 windows in the same pc, for 2 different SSDs ?</p> <p>They can also get my ip, but that doesnt chock that much.</p> <p>If u have any other tips or ideas for the problem i would apreciate, ty for ur time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Advanced_Current1213"> /u/Advanced_Current1213 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comme
