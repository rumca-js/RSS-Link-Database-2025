For example, instead of walking through a specific compliance framework that requires showing controls for use of 3rd party LLMs, the book/resource I have in mind would list that as an example of vendor risk management and would mention that such a scenario should be dealt with in the same way any vendor risk management scenario should be dealt with.</p> <p>In other words, is there a book/ resource that deals with the fundamental concepts and questions that occur and reoccur in all compliance frameworks? Instead of &quot;x, y, and z are requirements from A specific compliance framework&quot;; &quot;x, y, and z are examples of A type of concept in compliamce and can be found in several compliane frameworks...&quot; etc etc</p> <p>Or is this just silly :)</p>",
