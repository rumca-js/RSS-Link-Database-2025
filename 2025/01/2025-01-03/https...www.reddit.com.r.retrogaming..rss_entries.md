It works very well for all of my arcade needs, and I use it regularly. </p> <p>Now what I&#39;m looking for is something for console games. Things like the nes, snes, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, and Playstation 1 specifically. Bonus points if it has more niche consoles like the Sega CD or dreamcast. </p> <p>Does anyone have a unit they would recommend?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey retrogamers, long time, first time here! I’ve seen the love on this sub for Donkey Kong Country 2, and as a fellow lover of the game decided that 39 was the age that I was finally going to play its successor and hoo boy, let me start off by saying it was as underwhelming as 12 year old me imagined it would be.</p> <p>I’ll start with what I believe was a big preconceived notion I had for the game, even if it wasn’t not fully recognized in my younger years. I’m talking about the newest addition, Kiddy Kong. As the name implies, he is supposed to be an infant. In fairness though if the Kong family lived up to their names, Donkey Kong would be a farm animal and Diddie would be a child predator, so this may not always be the best basis for assumptions. As the game starts, Kiddy gets foisted off from Funky Kong, who’s way too cool to be tied down with kids, so now Dixie becomes his babysitter. He wears a onesie and stomps his hands and feet on the grou

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The title refers to the difference between early console vs arcade and why the former still being stuck in vague terminology.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t about the legitimacy of just playing a game casually. It&#39;s more about how this era of games which are today so highly valued for their challenge still being so vaguely defined in their challenge level, in comparison to similar challenging arcade counterparts.</p> <p>I grew up on the NES era but got serious about gaming much later and cut my teeth on arcade titles mainly.</p> <p>I&#39;m going back to my roots recently, and coming over from arcade mentality I find it really odd that there are still no clear definitions established for &quot;beating&quot; a game, and only rarely is it even mentioned.</p> <p>For example in arcade culture there&#39;s terms like 1ALL, 1CC, Clear, No Death, No Damage, etc to designate the type of run. And often a score is posted as well.</p> <p>If it&#39;s just for &quot;fun

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I need your help in finding a weird game. I know ALOT of games and I collect retro games for years and theres one game that I remember playing as a kid with my cousin and he cant recall it and since its a super weird game, I cant find any trace of it. I&#39;ll put down the details I remember about it (its been a long time so bear with me)</p> <p>It was a side scrolling game, modern time theme, obviously pixel art (mid 90s probably), art style was western and not anime/JPN. Now the weird thing, you could have sex with women you find in the game level. I dont remember it being like a porno game, but you see the action of it for a few seconds and you move on. I think there was shooting as well. I think the sex action was like HP regen or something. I was very young and we played it like just the one sitting. it was probably around 1995 to 1998. I also remember like action movie vibes. It was most definitely an action game. </p> <p

## Looking back at Rolling Thunder is fascinating for how cheap the original game is

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I don’t know if anyone here is familiar with the original game, but basically I just wanted to have a simple discussion on it due to its high difficulty factor as I found it interesting.</p> <p>For starters, what is most confusing about the game’s design aesthetics is the HUD as it says the player has a big health bar, but what I don’t get is how it works as for some reason, the main character can only get hurt by enemies twice, again despite having a big health bar.</p> <p>Secondly, while I did beat the original arcade version, I still cannot believe how cheap it gets towards the end as enemies come at the player relentlessly as the aforementioned health bar problem does not help since apparently the protagonist himself is very fragile.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaleidoArachnid"> /u/KaleidoArachnid </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hsamy4/looking_b

## Am I crazy or did Duke Nukem 1 (1991) have music?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have what I thought was a very clear memory of playing Duke Nukem 1 (the 1991 one) and dreading this one level - if I remember it right, it involved harmful green goop that you had to dodge dripping from ceilings - and there was this hyper-repetetive melody that has been stuck in my head for... wow. More than two decades. Lordy I&#39;m old. I dunno if this would help jar any memories, but the melody repeats [A G# G F# F E D# E] a bunch of times at the outset. Lots of chromatic stuff.</p> <p>Problem is, videos I find have no music, some people say it never had music, others say the music used to be there but was taken away, and others say the music existed but you need SoundBlaster to hear it. I&#39;ve looked up Andrew Hulshut&#39;s stuff and Bobby Prince&#39;s stuff, and nothing.</p> <p>Am I going crazy? Am I thinking of a different game, maybe? Thanks!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shiekhy
