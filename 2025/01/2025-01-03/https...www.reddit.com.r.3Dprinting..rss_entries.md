I knew it would be a close call, the model required 56 g, I checked the spool with the remaining filament and it was like 180 g. I thought this spool alone cannot be more than 100 g, so let&#39;s go.</p> <p>Well, only after the filament run out I was able to check and the empty spool was actually 130 g. So I had about 50 g of filament. And yes, slicer is not always right, but if I knew it would be THIS close, I would reduce infill or something, to have a bit of a wiggle room.</p> <p>And it struck me... How much more convinient would it be, if the spools had their weight stamped on them during manufacturing. It&#39;s not like every spool is different, most of them are injection molded with precise amount of material. It can&#39;t be hard to just include their intended weight on the mold, right? So that we can weight the material we have, subtr
