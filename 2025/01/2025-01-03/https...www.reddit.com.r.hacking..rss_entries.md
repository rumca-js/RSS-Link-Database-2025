<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been poking around the cruise (royal Caribbean wonder of the seas) network and decided to see what I could do with the tvs ethernet cable. I took the tv out of hospitality mode to get the mac address and also copied down the h.browser address (tv.xmedia/) I plugged the cable into my laptop, cloned the mac address on my laptop and navigated to it which I was met with the xmedia login page. I don’t know what else I should really be doing on the network (should be doing probably nothing but i’m curious) if anyone has any things they want me to check out or if i could somehow get full internet access through the cable or log in to the tvs interface from my laptop id love to hear your suggestions. I don’t want anything malicious just to see what I can do and further my own skills.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SirLlama123"> /u/SirLlama123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hac

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I recently started using unitron b-312 hearing aids on the cheapest technology level. There&#39;s 1,3,5,7,9 and the price difference is gigantic (around 3.5K from 1 to 9) and they charge you per hearing aid so I would be down 7k. Here&#39;s my question, the upgrades are merely software, I wonder therefore if it would be posible to hack them with a better technology level without paying such extreme amounts, I look forward to all comments and have a nice day!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Karma__Hunter"> /u/Karma__Hunter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hsnc73/could_one_hack_hearing_aids/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hsnc73/could_one_hack_hearing_aids/">[comments]</a></span>
