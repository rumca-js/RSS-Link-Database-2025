        "description": "Without a doubt, Seinfeld is one of, if not the most successful sitcom ever produced for television.  Though decades later, the Seinfeld finale is a contentious issue among fans.  Now, as Curb your Enthusiasm has come to an end fans have noticed that Larry David seemed to have \"fixed\" his mistakes dating back to the Seinfeld finale.  Basically ending Curb Your Enthusiasm in a similar, but more compelling way.  Even making note of it directly to Jerry Seinfeld in the shows final moments.  Which is why it can been seen that Curb Your Enthusiasm succeeded where Seinfeld came up short. \n\n#seinfeld #jerryseinfeld #larrydavid #curbyourenthusiasm #sitcom",
