The lawsuit says that TikTok was not only aware that TikTok Lives were exposing minors to concerning messages from adults, but the company also directly profited off of some of the exchanges through TikTok Live's virtual gifting system.</p>

<p>Be it for the Walkman portables and Trinitron TVs of old or the PlayStation consoles, Alpha cameras and superlative headphones of the twenty-first century, Sony has long been a mainstay at CES. But for the past couple of years at the world&#39;s biggest electronics trade show, Sony has opted to focus on a different field: Automotive. The Afeela electric vehicle dominated Sony&#39;s 2023 and 2024 CES press conferences, and we know that trend will continue for 2025, with an appearance at the Sony event (and a followup press conference) <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://

<p>Time to get into the habit of writing "2025" instead of 2024, and the year may have just begun, but the Engadget team is already working hard for CES 2025. This weekend, many from the Engadget team will be flying to Las Vegas, where we’ll be covering tech’s biggest annual conference. We've scoured our bursting inboxes, full of pitches from companies that are planning to be there, and meticulously filled out copious spreadsheets with upcoming launches and appointments for briefings and demos.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, as well as observation of recent industry trends, it’s fairly easy to make educated predictions about what we might see in a few days. Over the years, the focus of the conference has spanned areas like TVs, cars, smart home products and personal health, with a smattering of laptops and accessories thrown in. At CES 2025, we expect to see AI get even more pervasive in all areas of the show floor. But we are also likely to get the usual slew of new processors and

<p>Hisense unveiled its latest L9 series laser TV — the L9Q — at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2025/">CES 2025</a>. The “television” (an ultra-short-throw laser projector paired with a screen) comes with one of five screen sizes, ranging from 100 to 150 inches. The L9Q is the first in the series with auto screen alignment to ease the transition when you project it onto a different-sized screen.</p>
<p>The L9Q uses a proprietary Hisense triple-laser light engine, which helps the TV reach 110 percent of the BT.2020 (aka Rec. 2020) color space — a good omen for lifelike colors that pop. This model also boosts the brightness from previous models, reaching up to 5,000 lumens and a 5,000:1 contrast ratio.</p>

<p>Anthropic has partly resolved a legal disagreement that saw the AI startup draw the ire of the music industry. In October 2023, a group of music publishers, including Universal Music and ABKCO, filed a copyright infringement complaint against Anthropic. The group alleged that the company had trained its Claude AI model on at least 500 songs to which they held rights and that, when promoted, Claude could reproduce the lyrics of those tracks either partially or in full. Among the song lyrics the publishers said Anthropic had infringed on included Beyoncé’s “Halo” and “Moves Like Jagger” by Maroon 5.</p>

The PF600U may look like a stand fan, but it&#39;s actually a projector that&#39;s also a Bluetooth speaker and a LED mood lamp. Its lighting has nine colors and five brightness levels, so you can customize it to create the ambiance you want. Tilt its head, and you&#39;ve got yourself a projector that can produce images up to 120 inches in size with an FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution and 300 ANSI lumens of brightness. It can stream movies, shows and other content from streaming platforms via LG&#39;s webOS.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s other projector is CineBeam Q&#39;s direct successor. CineBeam S is now LG&#39;s smallest 4K Ultra Short Throw projector and weighs in at only 5.5 pounds. It&#39;s capable of delivering images as big as 100 inc

<p>We're ringing in 2025 with everything we're expecting to see at CES! That includes new video cards from AMD and NVIDIA, a holographic windshield from Hyundai and potentially more satellite enabled phones. AI will still be a major topic — like the next generation of AI PCs — but it also seems like we'll be hearing a lot more about classic CES stories. In addition, we explore why Meta wants to start adding AI users to Facebook and Instagram.</p>

## The Morning After: FCC’s attempt to restore net neutrality didn't work

<p>The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the FCC <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/us-court-of-appeals-rules-against-effort-to-restore-net-neutrality-205617210.html">does not</a> have the &quot;statutory authority&quot; to implement net neutrality rules.</p>
<p>Since the rules were established in 2015, the FCC argued that classifying ISPs as &quot;telecommunication services&quot; gives it broad authority to regulate them. The decision to redefine ISPs as &quot;information services&quot; during the first Trump Administration led to the repeal of net neutrality in 2017.</p>
<p>The current FCC voted to restore net neutrality on April 25 last year. The difference between 2015 and now is the Supreme Court&#39;s recent, radical reinterpretation of an important legal doctrine. The Chevron doctrine said that if Congress doesn&#39;t weigh in on an issue, courts are supposed to defer to the interpretation of government agencies. Now, inte

These AI PCs can optimize battery life, manage power across tasks and even enhance webcam quality during video calls. While AI integration is still relatively new in laptops, it’s a feature to watch if you’re considering future-proofing your setup. Plus, it’s exciting to see how these AI-powered PCs might handle everything from productivity to entertainment, offering smart adjustments and enhancements that could make our digital lives a bit easier.<br><br>Out of all of the notebooks we've tested and reviewed recently, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M3 to be the best laptop for most people, and this is still the case for our top picks to start off the new year.
