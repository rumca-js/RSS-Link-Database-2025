<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t understand why there is no talk of replacing all doctors that are not surgeons. They are a huge burden salary wise on the healthcare system, the education takes forever and in Europe where the state pays for tuition it costs a fortune in taxpayer money to pay for their education. We have numerous studies that show that LLM&#39;s outperform physicians, even if they use the aid of chatgpt. Why aren&#39;t states seriously analysing this issue, it would save a lot of money and lead to more access for patients to get treated and also to better results. The majority of the non urgent stuff they see is repetitive bs that can be solved by a nurse using chatgpt as of today. Their work is repetitive, they follow a set of guidelines, for chronic patients they literally have an algorithm for how to deal with most diseases. LLMs are tailor made for this stuff.They just need too keep the human nurses, so you would also get the human touch aspect solved

Due to client requirements, we use a somewhat outdated web application called ServiceBench that handles work orders and job information, but has very poor import/export and data management functionality. The first stage of the project will be developing an API for ServiceBench into a functional database and setting up some reporting. The second stage is automating claims processing in the simpler part of our business which is smartphone repair. The third stage is automating claims in the more complicated part of our business which is smart home device installation and set up. We are located in the Boston area but remote work is fine.

The AI is so imaginative and creative, and understands the framework of art so well.</p> <p>I already co-created two full length albums, one &quot;remix&quot; album with human DJs and producers, and several EPs together with ChatGPT.<br/> As I&#39;m a producer in the Doomcore / Techno / Noizy area of music, the music I work on together with ChatGPT is close to these genres, too.<br/> But ChatGPT is capable to help with almost any other genre as well.</p> <p>And this is not a lazy one-prompt-creates-a-song type of thing. It&#39;s *about* collaboration. About how AI can *enhance* your works of art, not how AI can *replace* you (or your art).<br/> So you still need to have some human production skills, and need to do a lot of work on your own here.<br/> Just like when

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There’s a great deal of overlap between the two, but one thing I think more people need to be discussing is distinction between the two and how that impacts our development of AI. </p> <p>Intelligence is the capacity to reason, solve problems, and adapt to new situations, reflecting an overarching ability to process and apply information effectively. In contrast, cognition refers to the mental processes involved in activities like reasoning, decision-making, memory, and perception. While intelligence describes the broader potential for performing these tasks, cognition encompasses the specific mechanisms and operations that enable reasoning and decision-making to occur. Essentially, intelligence is the “ability to think,” while cognition is “how thinking happens.”</p> <p>Basically, we risk overlooking some of the more fundamental aspects of how we think focusing primarily on intelligence.
