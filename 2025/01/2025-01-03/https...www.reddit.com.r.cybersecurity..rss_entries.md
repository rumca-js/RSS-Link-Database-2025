We are having the hiring team review over the next several weeks (potentially months) before we can confirm if we will be moving to interviews. If you do not hear from a recruiter, this means the hiring team has yet to select your application, but it is still in review. If selected for interviews, a recruiter will reach out and walk you through next steps and expected timeline at that time.</p> <p>Maybe I am looking in the wrong direction but most of the information, I found on how the internship process was for Software Engineers and not a ton of information on what the Security Engineer internship application process looks like.</p

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I&#39;ve built a small open-source project called <strong>PhantomGate</strong>, designed to mess with port scanners by sending them fake or randomized banners. The idea is to throw them off track and make their lives a bit more difficult when they&#39;re probing your ports.</p> <p><strong>How It Works</strong><br/> - Written entirely in Python (3.x).<br/> - Simply launch it with <code>phantomgate.py</code>, and it responds to incoming connections with predefined or randomized signatures.<br/> - There&#39;s a dedicated <code>signatures</code> folder where I&#39;ve grouped different types of signatures. You can load a specific file if you only want certain signatures to be used (e.g., <code>-s signatures/ssh_signatures.txt</code>).</p> <p><strong>Quick Start</strong><br/> 1. Clone or download the repo:<br/> <code> git clone https://github.com/keklick1337/PhantomGate </code> 2. Pick a signatures file or use the default <code>signatures.txt

The only other tool I know of that does this and is recently updated is <a href="https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex">Cortex</a> but I have not gotten around to trying that out yet. </p> <p>The script I am considering making is going to be modular and support sources such as - Public and private sandboxes - GeoIP data - VPN exit node identification - Malware sharing sites - DNS blocklist - IP abuse blocklists - Whois/RDAP data - Internet port scan data</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/After-Vacation-2146"> /u/After-Vacation-2146 </a> <br/> <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a freshman at college. Just finished my first semester. I spent a lot of time reading stuff about Machine learning and data science. And, I spent a lot of time reading about cybersecurity as well. My dilemma is that I find myself interested in both of these fields. I want to become an expert. So, I decided to dedicate a lump of my time, my entire college years, in specializing in this. I don&#39;t want to be a mediocre but to actually have a strong expertise in either of these.</p> <p>Then, it struck me, what if I actually learn cybersecurity in the mornings and data science (transition to ML roles later) in the evenings? </p> <p>Is this a disastrous idea where I turn out to be a half-cooked chap in both fields ~ a jack of both arts but a master of none? Or, is it actually wise to explore and develop an expert acumen in both of these, given that I have an ample amount of time before I set out to earn a livelihood?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3

However, ISMS frameworks differ in their approaches, methods, addressing of the cybersecurity domain, and management prioriti

Instead of &quot;x, y, and z are requirements from A specific compliance framework&quot;; &quot;x, y, and z are examples of A type of concept in compliamce and can be found in several compliane frameworks...&quot; etc etc</p> <p>Or is this just silly :)</p>
