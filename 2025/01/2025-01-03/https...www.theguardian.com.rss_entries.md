<p>Manchester United’s new manager is increasingly looking like an odd hire, especially compared to the successful succession at their arch rivals</p><p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United is the physical effect of the job, the altered optics. Amorim turned up at Old Trafford looking like a handsome pirate: the jawline, the seigneurial smile, the elite Euro-cardigan styling, the sense that here is someone who smells at all times of high-spec automobile upholstery.</p><p>Seven weeks in he has the air of a doomed royal hostage, shuttled joylessly from corridor to touchline by unseen handlers. The smile has fractured, the shoulders have drooped.

During Daniel Levy’s 24 years as chairman, there was once Harry Redknapp, warning of “bare bones” through Kevin Bond’s 4x4 window. The very public breakdown of Levy’s relations with Antonio Conte in 2023 came not long after the Italian failed to get what he wanted in the January sales. Tension boiled, too, with José Mourinho during the same month’s window.</p><p>Ange Postecoglou keeps his personal view of the ownership and the club’s executive class to himself.

<p>Barça are seasoned in the art of rejigging finances to get transfers done but they have been denied over Olmo and Pau Victor – for now</p><p>Rarely can a trademark have fitted so well, even if it wasn’t <em>exactly</em> the way Dani Olmo intended it. Not long ago the Barcelona midfielder lodged his own brand with the European Union; it includes the goalscoring celebration, borrowed from the Milwaukee Bucks basketball player Damian Lillard, in which he stands pointing at his wrist, asking what time it is. Over the past few days, the image has been everywhere and everyone else has been asking the same question, staring at their watches, waiting as the seconds tick by. The answer of course is: Olmo Time. Or it was supposed to be.</p><p>Instead, time has run out on him. Signed from RB Lepizig on a deal worth almost €60m, Olmo has five months later been removed from the squad after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/31/barcelona-make-fresh-attempt-register-dani-

<p>What you need to buy to make sure your new year resolution of following a plant-based diet lasts beyond January</p><p>Whether you’re doing it for the animals, your health or environmental reasons, there’s never been a better time to go vegan. There’s meatless meat, dairy-free cheese, plant-based liqueurs and, well, anything else you can think of.</p><p>With more than a decade of veganism under my belt, I’ve tried pretty much every plant-based brand going. I was a full-blown omnivore until the age of 20 though, so I can tell straight away when a new vegan product hasn’t got it right. Below, I cover the must-buy alternatives, from cheese to meat, to the foods that would-be vegans fear they’d miss the most. I’ll also tell you what not to buy.

<p>A rerun of last season’s final is a strong start to the year but the domestic game will soon be on hold for the Six Nations</p><p>There was a time when the first weekend of the new year meant immersion in what we kindly describe as rugby for the purists. The dark days between Christmas and spring are not easy for anyone, but they are largely responsible for giving rugby a bad name in this part of the world. Ten-man rugby, like asceticism, was pretty much invented for January.</p><p>And yet it is a concept that these days feels totally alien to the Premiership. An icy blast this weekend may yet precipitate a sudden tightening of coats, but such sobriety would represent quite the about-turn of current trends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/03/premiership-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Bristol Old Vic<br></strong>In Sonali Bhattacharyya’s tale, Liana Cottrill’s striking and gracefully realised mermaid is driven to leave her home not for a crush on a prince but in order to save the seas</p><p>In Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale, the oceans are cornflower-blue and clear as purest glass. But retelling The Little Mermaid today calls for a consideration of environmental damage and Disney’s 2023 blockbuster had Ariel’s father, King Triton, rebuking humans for disrespectfully “spoiling our waters” with the wreckage of their adventuring.</p><p>Directed by Miranda Cromwell, Sonali Bhattacharyya’s eco-fable is a timely call to arms for young audiences (it’s aimed at over-sevens). Her mermaid, Sereia (Liana Cottrill), is primarily driven to leave her home not for a crush on a prince but in order to save the dying Coral (personified by Nandi Bhebhe).

<p>A woman tries to escape her painful past in this moving novella from the author of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas </p><p>When 52-year-old Willow arrives at a rental cottage in a far-flung island off the coast of Ireland, she determinedly keeps herself to herself. The cottage is small and unheated, with a modest kitchen and a bedroom with a single bed. Unpacking some hair clippers, she sets about shaving her shoulder-length blond hair to the “uncomplicated blunt crop of a hard-working country woman”.</p><p>Willow, who was previously called Vanessa, apparently does not wish to be recognised among her island neighbours, who are understandably nosy about new arrivals. In her old life she was married for 28 years to Brendan, a swimming coach who is now in jail (the nature of his crime, and the ensuing scandal, becomes apparent later on). The couple had lived in Dublin and had two children, one of whom died tragically young. The other, now an adult, barely speaks to Willow who sends her

After dinner, I stopped for a&nbsp;beer at the Malmaison hotel. I’m pretty fussy about beer and I love an English bitter. I&nbsp;asked the bartender if she had any ales.&nbsp;She offered me a European pilsner, though eventually got me a&nbsp;Deuchars IPA.</p><p>There were a few cricketers in the bar, so I was chatting to them while I&nbsp;distractedly tapped my card on the reader to pay for the beer. The bartender said it didn’t work and asked me to do&nbsp;it again and put my pin in. I did, then she asked if I&nbsp;wanted a receipt. I&nbsp;never get receipts. I’m a bit careless with money and not&nbsp;very attentive.

<p>The prize-winning author on a masterclass from Hilary Mantel, rereading James Joyce, and coming back to Wuthering Heights</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory</strong><br>
 I was seven. It was a book called Run With the Wind, by Tom McCaughren, which is&nbsp;like an Irish riff on Watership Down but with foxes instead of rabbits. I loved it.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/alexandredumaspere">Alexandre Dumas</a>’s The Three Musketeers. I&nbsp;think I was 12.

<p>From a classy trouser suit to a rebellious dash of colour against the grey, brave dressing will embolden you in today’s uncertain world</p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about something the fashion designer Bella Freud said recently, which was that she aims to create clothes that make you feel intrepid. This was such a nice way of expressing what great clothes do, which is not just to give you confidence, but also to connect you to the world. What you wear is the membrane between you and, well, everything else. Good clothes make you feel comfortable within your skin, and they can also make you feel like a <em>player</em>.</p><p>Fashion to make you feel intrepid comes in many different forms, and&nbsp;looks different for each of us. A&nbsp;jumpsuit makes me feel so brave that&nbsp;I could jump out of a plane. (I&nbsp;could never, ever jump out of a plane. But it’s a nice fantasy to inhabit, as I zip myself up.) A trouser suit can be brilliant: very armoured, but very civilised. Night-

<p>Take a hanky to this film – you’ll laugh and you might well cry. Andrew Garfield and the director John Crowley talk about portraying grief on screen so it rings true</p><p>It’s no spoiler to say that We Live in Time is a tearjerker. It begins with the late-stage cancer diagnosis of its female lead, Almut (Florence Pugh), a rising star chef. The story then leaps back and forth through time to paint a picture of her relationship with Tobias, a cereal marketing executive (Andrew Garfield): the charming meet-cute (a car crash), their early courtship, the birth of their daughter in a service station loo. At the London premiere, one woman near me cried so much as the credits rolled that she felt compelled to apologise to everyone in the vicinity.</p><p>“I think that’s a shame,” says Garfield. “That someone would feel that they had to apologise. I think that speaks to a cultural thing that we have, particularly in the UK, where outward expressions of emotion are deemed somehow inappropri

But no one watched it. This grimly fascinating two-part documentary explores the making of a ratings monster as, under the supervision of producer and “diabolical genius” Richard Dominick, it ramped up extremity, actively provoked the worst impulses of its guests, abandoned any notion of duty of care and ushered in a dark era of television. Many of the show’s behind-the-scenes names are interviewed here and all manifest a revealing level of moral equivocation.
