This was such a nice way of expressing what great clothes do, which is not just to give you confidence, but also to connect you to the world. What you wear is the membrane between you and, well, everything else. Good clothes make you feel comfortable within your skin, and they can also make you feel like a <em>player</em>.</p><p>Fashion to make you feel intrepid comes in many different forms, and&nbsp;looks different for each of us. A&nbsp;jumpsuit makes me feel so brave that&nbsp;I could jump out of a plane. (I&nbsp;could never, ever jump out of a plane. But it\u2019s a nice fantasy to inhabit, as I zip myself up.)

But no one watched it. This grimly fascinating two-part documentary explores the making of a ratings monster as, under the supervision of producer and \u201cdiabolical genius\u201d Richard Dominick, it ramped up extremity, actively provoked the worst impulses of its guests, abandoned any notion of duty of care and ushered in a dark era of television. Many of the show\u2019s behind-the-scenes names are interviewed here and all manifest a revealing level of moral equivocation.
