        "description": "Astronomers have detected possible binary black holes at the centres of galaxies, using light patterns from active galactic nuclei as key indicators. The study of PG 1553+153, in particular, shows evidence of a 20-year variation, pointing to a system of two supermassive black holes. If confirmed, this could provide new insights into galaxy formation and black hole behaviour. Gravitational waves could offer the final proof needed for these extraordinary cosmic systems",

        "description": "Researchers are exploring the potential of bird-inspired wing flaps to improve airplane performance. These featherlike flaps, designed to mimic the covert feathers on bird wings, could significantly enhance lift, reducing drag and improving stability. Tests show that the new design could boost lift by up to 45% and decrease drag by 31%. The flaps also prevent stalls, which could be particularly useful during landings or flights through turbulent conditions.",
