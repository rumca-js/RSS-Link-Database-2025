The future looks bleak for properties on fast-eroding cliffs and large areas of rich agricultural land on the east coast, already at or even below sea level.</p><p>The evidence that things are rapidly getting worse is clear. Sea levels have risen 24cm (9in) (7ft 3in) since 1880 but the rise has accelerated from an average of 1.4mm a year in the 20th century <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level">to 3.6mm annually by 2015</a>.
