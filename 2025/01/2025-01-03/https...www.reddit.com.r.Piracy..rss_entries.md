Today I thought I would just for fun see if the cracked version might work better. And lo and behold, I was playing it just fine. And it even picked up the saves that were left on my PC after the steam install, so I did not even have to restart the game. Piracy wins again.

Mostly have no issues with downloading but occasionally have trouble finding something. What&#39;s my best bet for filling in the missing things? Like there&#39;s a few large tv series I have downloaded like for example shameless and there&#39;s just like 2-3 episodes I cannot get my hands on at all from just random seasons. What&#39;s my best bet? Should I add something to my usenet setup? I do not wanna do a block tbh because I don&#39;t like feeling like im limited on downloading amount unless there&#39;s some cheapish unlimited block account or something idk. I was also considering getting a seedbox and using that to torrent content then send it back home? I currently have my content hosted on my homeserver with i5-12600k and 24TB of storage. Kinda at a stuck point not sure what to add or do from here.</p> <
