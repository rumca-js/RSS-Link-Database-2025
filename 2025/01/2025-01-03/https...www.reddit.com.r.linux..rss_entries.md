<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the new generation of graphics cards around the corner, I&#39;m seeing a lot of Linux communities getting excited and discussing upgrading to the Latest and Greatest™ as soon as they can. As nice as it sounds to replace your aging RX580 or 1080Ti with something from this decade, please remember that decent Linux support for new hardware is <em>not</em> guaranteed for days, weeks, or even months after the hardware is actually released. Features might be missing, performance might be atrocious, bugs or crashes may be common, and it&#39;s even possible your distribution won&#39;t support the software required.</p> <p>As an example, take the AMD 7000 series GPUs. The first GPU released was the 7900 XTX in December 2022, which <em>technically</em> had initial support in the 6.0 kernel from October 2022 and Mesa 22.2 in September. However, there were significant performance issues and features missing until the 6.2 kernel was released in February 2023

## Is Ghostty using GTK for linux a drawback?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve configured ghostty and i&#39;m quite impressed with it, ease of customization, smoother scrolling than any other emulator i&#39;ve used. However it&#39;s very slow to start, all the research i&#39;ve made lead me to believe this is because of it&#39;s dependence on GTK. While other terms like kitty, alacritty can start in under 0.30s, ghostty needs over a second to start. Even with gtk-single-instance on, subsequent starts can be fast but the first instance of ghostty will always be very slow. This is quite a drawback because in truth many linux users dont care about gtk or a &quot;native feel&quot; for apps, alot of users just use a tiling window manager or compositor and would much prefer a bare bones emulator that just starts without initializing gtk or qt in the background.</p> <p>Maybe i&#39;m doing something wrong, but i hope later on there is an option to to run ghostty without any dependence on gtk and it can just draw the terminal o

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking what if we had a very lite immutable Linux distro somewhat like Alpine Linux (or TinyCore) with WASI Runtime on top of it to run apps compiled down to WebAssembly? And have a big repository of WebAssembly apps to access them? </p> <p>What&#39;s your opinion on such a distro? Would you use it and like it? It can be so lite because the host is only needed for running WASI Runtime which can then run all the other apps. </p> <p>I personally think WebAssembly apps running on a WASI Runtime is a great alternative to Flatpaks, Appimages and Snaps. </p> <p>PS: I am new to this WebAssembly and WASI tech so experts please feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood anything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Large-Start-9085"> /u/Large-Start-9085 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hsfazt/wasi_based_lite_distro/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/
