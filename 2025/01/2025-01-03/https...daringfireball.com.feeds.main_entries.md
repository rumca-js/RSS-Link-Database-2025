<p>Fascinating piece by Ben Cohen for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AGKT_QIDtRQ6DA4lJXJWiTg">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And there are two things I learned about the EUV tool I saw that I
can’t get out of my head:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ASML teamed up with a German optical company to develop mirrors
so flat that if they were scaled up to the size of Germany
itself, their largest imperfection would be less than a
millimeter.</p></li>
<li><p>The precision of EUV machines is comparable to directing a
laser beam from your house and hitting a ping-pong ball on the
moon.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It took decades for these absurdly sophisticated machines to make
their way from labs to fabs. And until recently, it wasn’t clear
if the company’s audacious bet on EUV lithography would ever pay
off. In 2012, ASML was strapped for cash and sold a 23% equity
stake to Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing, which meant its biggest customers were lite

<p>Axios co-founder Mike Allen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook will personally donate $1 million to
President-elect Trump’s inaugural committee, sources with
knowledge of the donation tell Axios. [...]</p>

<p>Cook, a proud Alabama native, believes the inauguration is a
great American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in
the spirit of unity, the sources said. The company is not
expected to give.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Donald Trump tried to overthrow the legitimate results of the 2020 election to remain in office, and as part of his efforts, inspired a violent mob of insurrectionists to <a href="https://celadonbooks.com/book/the-january-6th-report/">invade the U.S. Capitol and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/02/willison-llms-2024">Speaking of</a> Simon Willison, I great enjoyed this post from his week, with some of the self-imposed principles he follows writing his excellent eponymous blog. Amongst them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>I always include <em>the names of the people</em> who created the
content I am linking to, if I can figure that out. Credit is
really important, and it’s also useful for myself because I can
later search for someone’s name and find other interesting
things they have created that I linked to in the past. If I’ve
linked to someone’s work three or more times I also try to
notice and upgrade them to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/">a dedicated tag</a>. [...]</li>
<li>If the original author reads my post, I want them to <em>feel good

publish something online the silence can be deafening. Knowing
that someone else read, appreciated, unders
