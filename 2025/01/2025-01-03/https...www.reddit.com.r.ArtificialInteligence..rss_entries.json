They are a huge burden salary wise on the healthcare system, the education takes forever and in Europe where the state pays for tuition it costs a fortune in taxpayer money to pay for their education. We have numerous studies that show that LLM&#39;s outperform physicians, even if they use the aid of chatgpt. Why aren&#39;t states seriously analysing this issue, it would save a lot of money and lead to more access for patients to get treated and also to better results. The majority of the non urgent stuff they see is repetitive bs that can be solved by a nurse using chatgpt as of today. Their work is repetitive, they follow a set of guidelines, for chronic patients they literally have an algorithm for how to deal with most diseases. LLMs are tailor made for this stuff.They just need too keep the human nurses, so you would also get the human touch aspect solved",

Due to client requirements, we use a somewhat outdated web application called ServiceBench that handles work orders and job information, but has very poor import/export and data management functionality. The first stage of the project will be developing an API for ServiceBench into a functional database and setting up some reporting. The second stage is automating claims processing in the simpler part of our business which is smartphone repair. The third stage is automating claims in the more complicated part of our business which is smart home device installation and set up. We are located in the Boston area but remote work is fine.

Using causal analysis, they identified a subset of the model (a circuit) that explains most of the model\u2019s behavior for basic arithmetic logic and examined its functionality. Now we finally have the answer to how LLMs solve maths and reasoning tasks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/aiguys/llms-cant-learn-maths-reasoning-finally-proved-ed878770227b?sk=3c098710e8126e9b1f2f786e5960d3ad\"><strong>LLMs Can\u2019t Learn Maths &amp; Reasoning, Finally Proved!</strong></a></p> <p>If you take a loo",
