Our test suite has over 5800 tests and currently takes around 1h 20m to go through everything during every PR.</p> <p>I know some of the tests are slow because they hit the file system, and some tests are slow because they use <code>TransactionalTestCase</code> (because of some over zealous use of signals) some are slow because they hit external services.</p> <p>I want to try and find the slowest test cases that we have so I can refactor them and get some quick wins on the tests that perform the worst, does anyone have any suggestions of the best way to do this? Are there any packages you would recommend? I would ideally like to export a report that can be shared with other members of the team, or build something that can be reported through GitHub actions.</p> <p>Because the project is so big I&#39;m currently limited to Python 3.9 and Django 3.2, we&#39;re using the built in Django unit",

Many people have told me that there is no future of Flask. I know that Django is feature rich whereas Flask provides a minimalist approach where you only install what you need. But the problem arises is that I am concerned about my skills in the long run. Is Flask used at the production level? My goal is to crack Big Tech company. Is it really worth the hassle to move towards Django or should I move with Flask? </p> <p>I hope to hear from the community.</p> <h1>django #learndjango #python #drf #rest #api</h1> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ContentCar3092\"> /u/ContentCar3092 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hsi5cz/should_i_go_for_django/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hsi5cz/should_i_go_for_dj",
