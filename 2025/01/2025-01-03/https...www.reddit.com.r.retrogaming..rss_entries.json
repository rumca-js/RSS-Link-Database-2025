I have a little experience and no that claiming such a robust log generally just means there are a dozen versions of each game that you don&#39;t need or won&#39;t care about. </p> <p>For my arcade setup, I have a Legends gamer ultimate puck with a thumb drive for coinops x. It works very well for all of my arcade needs, and I use it regularly. </p> <p>Now what I&#39;m looking for is something for console games. Things like the nes, snes, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, and Playstation 1 specifically. Bonus points if it has more niche consoles like the Sega CD or dreamcast. </p> <p>Does anyone have a unit they would recommend?

I\u2019ve seen the love on this sub for Donkey Kong Country 2, and as a fellow lover of the game decided that 39 was the age that I was finally going to play its successor and hoo boy, let me start off by saying it was as underwhelming as 12 year old me imagined it would be.</p> <p>I\u2019ll start with what I believe was a big preconceived notion I had for the game, even if it wasn\u2019t not fully recognized in my younger years. I\u2019m talking about the newest addition, Kiddy Kong. As the name implies, he is supposed to be an infant. In fairness though if the Kong family lived up to their names, Donkey Kong would be a farm animal and Diddie would be a child predator, so this may not always be the best basis for assumptions. As the game starts, Kiddy gets foisted off from Funky Kong, who\u2019s way too cool to be tied down with kids, so now Dixie becomes his babysitter.

I know ALOT of games and I collect retro games for years and theres one game that I remember playing as a kid with my cousin and he cant recall it and since its a super weird game, I cant find any trace of it. I&#39;ll put down the details I remember about it (its been a long time so bear with me)</p> <p>It was a side scrolling game, modern time theme, obviously pixel art (mid 90s probably), art style was western and not anime/JPN. Now the weird thing, you could have sex with women you find in the game level. I dont remember it being like a porno game, but you see the action of it for a few seconds and you move on. I think there was shooting as well. I think the sex action was like HP regen or something. I was very young and we played it like just the one sitting. it was probably around 1995 to 1998. I also remember like action movie vibes. It was most definitely an action game. </p> <p",

More than two decades. Lordy I&#39;m old. I dunno if this would help jar any memories, but the melody repeats [A G# G F# F E D# E] a bunch of times at the outset. Lots of chromatic stuff.</p> <p>Problem is, videos I find have no music, some people say it never had music, others say the music used to be there but was taken away, and others say the music existed but you need SoundBlaster to hear it.
