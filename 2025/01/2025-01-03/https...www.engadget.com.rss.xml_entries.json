Tilt its head, and you&#39;ve got yourself a projector that can produce images up to 120 inches in size with an FHD (1,920 x 1,080) resolution and 300 ANSI lumens of brightness. It can stream movies, shows and other content from streaming platforms via LG&#39;s webOS.</p>\n<p>The company&#39;s other projector is CineBeam Q&#39;s direct successor.
