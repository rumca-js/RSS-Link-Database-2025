Not to make myself sound dumb, but when i\u2019ve tried to read fantasy previously I can\u2019t keep up with the various creature names and certain locations. I end up getting confused and it\u2019s hard for me to maintain focus on everything. I also have adhd so I already really have to try hard when reading lol. I have heard fourth wing is good and would be interested in reading that. Is that one pretty good for someone that is just getting into fantasy or should I start somewhere else?

Just finiahed The Writer&#39;s Labyrinth by Leilac Leamas, and it\u2019s got this crazy mix of the Sicilian Mafia (Cosa Nostra) and the Calabria mafia (Nghretta) playing a pretty funny and central role, with a cool twist. It\u2019s all about espionage, finabcial manipulation, a shady American hedge fund, sketchy lawyers, and this invisible hand pulling the strings. The mafia isn\u2019t just a traditional villain, they\u2019re more like a force messing with the global legal and financial systems. I\u2019m super into books or stories that mix all this stuff\u2014mafia, espionage, finance, and even some legal drama. Has anyone read something like this? Or got recommendations for stories with these kinds of characters and themes? The book I read got me thinking about how the mafia can be more than just violence, but a global network of influence.

They were about the US in the far future after the ice caps melted and the US had been split into two countries the western and easterm sides. The books swaps between two characters male and female both are super smart. The first book starts on the western side the government makes everyone take a test to see where you are placed for your job. The male character &quot;failed&quot; the test so the government disposed of him but he ended up surviving and started being on the run and the female character was the &quot;only person&quot; to score a perfect score and is tasked with hunting the male character down.

I loved the writing how the entire world always felt whimsical. I tried Percy Jackson but it felt way too childish for me and I gave up after the first few chapters, maybe that\u2019s because I have no nostalgia for it.
