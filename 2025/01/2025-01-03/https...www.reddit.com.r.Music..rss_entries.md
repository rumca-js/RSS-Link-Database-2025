<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a male 16 year old and i want to start busking i love playing guitar and i can put lyrics in while i play but thats not the problem. I can&#39;t do a medium high pitch. My voice starts to crack ive been declared a bass in my school choir<br/> Im able to go low enough to the point im happy but i cant go high to save my life and most of the songs i sing have points in the where i need to sing in a higher pitch. For example in the Sailor son when it goes &quot; looking like ann hathAWAY&quot;.the part that i put in caps is what i mean by going in a higher pitch if you seqrch it up and listen you will know what i mean.</p> <p>All im asking is does anyone know how to 1. Sing in a high ish pitch<br/> 2. go from a lower pitch to higher pitch smoothly 3.bend or put some extra enthusiasm on there singing </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Street_Manager_4212"> /u/Street_Manager_4212 </a> <br/> <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was inspired to post this while listening to The B-52s and realizing that Kate Pierson’s voice is very emblematic of the 80’s. To clarify, this isn’t asking about most successful since that would easily be Madonna. But in the same way a lot of 90s male alternative singers took on the Eddie Vedder sound, the 80s seemed to have a certain quality to its female singers. </p> <p>Who would you say is the singer that best exemplified what you think was the 80’s sound?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InquisitaB"> /u/InquisitaB </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hsrq8d/which_female_voice_from_the_80s_would_you_present/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hsrq8d/which_female_voice_from_the_80s_would_you_present/">[comments]</a></span>

## UK 2024: CDs are the top physical format, outselling vinyl by 57% (unit sales)

The CD market has stabilized, with only a tiny decline on last year (-2.9%); vinyl keeps growing (9.1%), but CDs sold about 3.8 million (or 57%) more units than LPs. Also, the overall physical music market recorded the first overall growth in 20 years, up 10%.</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> 10.5 million units</p> <p><strong>Vinyl:</strong> 6.7 million units</p> <p>Good to see that physical formats are doing well in general, and clearly the industry hasn&#39;t succeeded in killing off the CD format yet. It looks like both can coexist into the future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.co
