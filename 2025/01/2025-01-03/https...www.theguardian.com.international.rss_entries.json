If you have a used vanilla pod (ie, one from which the seeds have already been scraped), this is a great way to use it up. Zap the pod in the microwave for 20 seconds and watch it puff up as any remaining moisture escapes (you could also roast it in the oven for 10 minutes). This makes it easier to blend with the toasted hazelnuts, which add a deep flavour and nice crunch.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jan/03/hazelnut-toasted-vanilla-bueno-cookies-recipe-phil-khoury\">Continue reading...</a>",

Starting life on the humble Xbox 360, it found its way on to Nintendo Switch, virtual reality headsets, PS5 and even Amazon\u2019s Alexa.

Frontman Alex Kapranos was in his 30s when the band released their debut album, which combined sharp riffs with arch, arty posturing and lugubrious vocals. Kapranos and co were cooler than their contemporaries in both senses: their aesthetic was less messy and their lyrics less bracingly obvious, but they were also less sweatily relatable.</p><p>If Franz Ferdinand were the grownups back then, 20 years on they\u2019re positively avuncular.
