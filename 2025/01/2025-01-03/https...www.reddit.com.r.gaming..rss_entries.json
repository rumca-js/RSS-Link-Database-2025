Yes, we have 4-5 and they look great, but they also take forever to develop. I really don\u2019t know too much but I do know that Rockstar developed 3 full fledged titles within a three year period, twenty years ago. I would be just as happy getting a lower fidelity game that\u2019s jam packed with content and atmosphere. Whatever happened to San Andreas stories?? Not everything needs to be the best and shiniest, just make it fun! I think people are starting to care less and less about how good a game can look and rather on how sucked in you will become due to addicting gameplay mechanics or expanded story elements. </p> <p>What other franchises do you think would thrive in today\u2019s age with their older style graphics? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ICPosse8\"> /u/ICPosse8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",

Take for example a game like Rimworld where I lose colonists or a good portion of my base is destroyed/looted-- feels bad, man. I lost so much time and progress. I gotta reload! Or games like Darkest Dungeon or XCOM, where I lose one of my best trained people to some really bad enemy attacks one after another. I just lose motivation to keep going from there. Or especially games like Cataclysm, Dark Days Ahead, where I&#39;ve spent so much time on one character that I can&#39;t bear to have them die now and I gotta start over again.</p> <p>I can understand things like temporary setbacks or challenging rogue-like",
