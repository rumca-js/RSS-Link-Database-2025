<p>Fun combat, breezy banter and colourful characters promise to make this role playing game from Obsidian a must-play for fans of Skyrim</p><p>There was a long-running joke that Bethesda’s Skyrim had become so ubiquitous that it would run on anything. Starting life on the humble Xbox 360, it found its way on to Nintendo Switch, virtual reality headsets, PS5 and even Amazon’s Alexa. After more than 13 years, its sequel is still nowhere to be seen, so role playing game veterans Obsidian are offering fans an alternative in the form of Avowed.</p><p>I’m taken aback by just how fun and breezy it is, given that it has been spun off the somewhat stuffier computer RPG Pillars of Eternity.

<p>Prefectures in north hit by falls of up to 30cm in a day as similar weather pattern affects parts of north America</p><p>Heavy snow fell across northern Japan on Thursday, with the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori, Yamagata and Niigata particularly affected. Accumulations of 20-30cm over a 24-hour period were recorded across the affected areas, with local totals of more than 30cm near Aomori City.</p><p>The snowfall was a result of heavy showers generated by a cold airmass moving in from the north-west across the relatively warm waters of the Sea of Japan. This resulted in warming of the lowest levels of the atmosphere, leading to rising motion and convective shower development caused by the increased moisture.

<p><strong>(Domino)</strong><br>Alex Kapranos and co are finally acting their age, but have lost their cool in the process</p><p>For the most part, British indie-mania of the 00s involved a slew of sixth-form poets holding forth over amateurishly jerky guitars: the results were often simultaneously brilliant and deeply cringeworthy. Somehow, Franz Ferdinand managed to establish themselves as a tent pole of the scene while wholly bypassing the awkward young upstart vibe. Frontman Alex Kapranos was in his 30s when the band released their debut album, which combined sharp riffs with arch, arty posturing and lugubrious vocals. Kapranos and co were cooler than their contemporaries in both senses: their aesthetic was less messy and their lyrics less bracingly obvious, but they were also less sweatily relatable.</p><p>If Franz Ferdinand were the grownups back then, 20 years on they’re positively avuncular. The Human Fear – their sixth album, and first since 2018 – feels markedly middle-aged
