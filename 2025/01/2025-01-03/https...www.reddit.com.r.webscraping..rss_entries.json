The state bar associations are listed in this particular website: <a href=\"https://generalbar.com/State.aspx\">https://generalbar.com/State.aspx</a><br/> An example would be <a href=\"https://apps.calbar.ca.gov/attorney/LicenseeSearch/QuickSearch?FreeText=aa&amp;SoundsLike=false\">https://apps.calbar.ca.gov/attorney/LicenseeSearch/QuickSearch?FreeText=aa&amp;SoundsLike=false</a><br/> Now manually handcrafting specific scrapers for each state is perfectly doable but my hair will start turning grey if I did it with selenium/playwright only. The problem is that I have only got until tomorrow to show my results so I would ideally like to finish scraping at least 10-20 state bar directories. Are there any AI or non-AI tools that can significantly speed up the process so",
