And until recently, it wasn\u2019t clear\nif the company\u2019s audacious bet on EUV lithography would ever pay\noff. In 2012, ASML was strapped for cash and sold a 23% equity\nstake to Intel, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing, which meant its biggest customers were lite",

Credit is\nreally important, and it\u2019s also useful for myself because I can\nlater search for someone\u2019s name and find other interesting\nthings they have created that I linked to in the past.
