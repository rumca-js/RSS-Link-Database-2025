<p>Virtually every aspect of technology has been affected, and potentially improved, by artificial intelligence (AI). PCs are no exception. While the meaning of “AI PC” <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3611479/just-what-then-heck-does-an-ai-pc-do.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3611479/just-what-then-heck-does-an-ai-pc-do.html">is still evolving</a>, it generally refers to a computer specifically designed to excel at AI-powered tasks.

<p>The reintroduction of neutrality rules for network providers is looking increasingly unlikely, at least for the next five years, after a US appeals court blocked efforts by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reinstate them.</p>



<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit court upheld its earlier stay on the FCC’s May 2024 <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-52A1.pdf">Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet Order</a>, effectively pausing the policy’s return.</p>



<p>The net neutrality rules require that providers of telecommunications services treat all traffic equally, but give providers of information services more freedom to filter or prioritiz

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3511199/everything-we-know-about-apple-intelligence.html">artificial intelligence development</a>, Apple seems more interested than usual in seeking out good acquisition targets, potentially building on the small acquisitions it makes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56178792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most months</a>. The company has, in fact, led the industry when it comes to strategic AI acquisitions since 2023.</p>



<p>Why? Because it must.</p>

<p>Continuing education has always been important for IT professionals, but the need to keep your skill set up to date is now more important than ever. </p>



<p>While it’s easy to look to enterprise vendors — or independent operations such  CompTIA — as sources for training and certification, the options for IT pros tasked with managing Macs, iPhones, and other Apple devices aren’t as well-known. But there are plethora of resources out there, if you know where to look.</p>

Annoyingly, many of these are big tech businesses that can most easily enable their workers to work remotely.</p>



<p>This trend, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3532158/amazons-rto-mandate-likely-to-boomerang-other-companies-should-not-follow-suit.html">likely to continue in 2025</a>, costs workers real money.
