<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, recently my home network randomly went down. My home ISP (Truespeed) emailed me and told me that it was due to a massive DDoS attack, and that they had to block my internet so that it did not effect others in my area. I have asked for my IP address to be changed, but they said that since is the first time this has happened, they cannot do this. Are there any ISP&#39;s in the UK that offer any DDoS protection of some sort so that this wouldn&#39;t happen again? Obviously there is never a solution that can be 100% effective against DDoS attacks, but surely there some sort of DDoS protection from at least 1 ISP in the UK?</p> <p>I really would not like for this to happen again, so please any suggestions on what I can do to prevent this will be very helpful. I have no way of using VPN on my entire network, and that is the only thing I could think of to prevent this kind of thing (other than actual DDoS protection).</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> <
