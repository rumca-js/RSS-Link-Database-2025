However, the actor playing the trans character is a cisgender male instead of a transgender female. NBC News will have you know there are people bothered by this transgression in the  unintentionally hilarious titled piece of content "<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/squid-game-trans-character-casting-controversy-rcna184845" target="_blank">Viewers call out 'Squid Game' for casting a cisgender actor as a trans character.</a>"</p><p>Yes.
