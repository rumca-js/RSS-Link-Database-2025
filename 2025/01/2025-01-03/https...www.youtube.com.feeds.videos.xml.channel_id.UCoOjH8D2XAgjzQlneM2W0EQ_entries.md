So you run a country and you have a problem:
Every few years, you have to get re-elected. 
And what is the #1 way to get fired by voters?
If the economy is doing bad‚Ä¶ Because a bad economy equals people struggling to pay rent, buy food, and all that stuff.
Heck even if you run a dictatorship, if the people are suffering too much, eventually you‚Äôre gonna get overthrown‚Ä¶
So that‚Äôs why your #1 priority as a noble leader is ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù - economic growth
Why? Because if your country makes more money, there‚Äôs less unemployment, the plebs are at least content with the status quo, you get more tax dollars, more weapons, more nukes, more leverage ove
