Anytime I try to play a game where l&#39;m navigating through an area/world I start feeling sick not long after. Stationary games like beat saber or Tetris are fine, but a mild run on a roller coaster or casually walking around a meta horizons world has me nauseated in no time at all. Afterwards I&#39;ll continue to feel sick for hours. I&#39;m 32 and l&#39;ve read that the older you are, the more difficult it is for your body to adjust between the feedback coming from your eyes and ears. I&#39;d like to check out action games like bone lab after some of my nephews recommended it, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll last more than a minute or two lol.

I came down to a quest 3s or pico 4. I mainly want to use it for pcvr. From what i gathered pico 4 will be better for PCVR but MR seems cool, tho im afraid i will trade off lenses for a gimmick i wont use. Also controllers on the quest seem better(?). I plan to upgrade my pc in ~2 years so i could future proof but by then i expect better options (deckard or a new quest). So what would you reccomend? Is MR more than a gimmick? Also my pc specs are : 1660 OC 6GB, i5 9400f, 16 GB ram. Yes im aware its not gonna run everything and i know how to get around it. My budget doesnt go above these options.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ksavx\"> /u/ksavx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hspqps/quest_3s_or_pico_4/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=",

My PC is hardwired to my router, and my Quest 3S is connected to my router via WiFi 6E. My router is an ASUS AXE11000 and is on the first floor of my house while I am on the second floor. Because of this, I assume this is probably just a range issue.</p> <p>Without moving to a different room or getting a dedicated router, how can I improve the connectivity between my 3S and my router? Is there a cost-effective way to extend the range of my router? What settings can be changed in my Quest 3S / Air Link to improve connectivity?

I currently rely on a Wi-Fi extender to connect my PC to the internet. \u2022 However, I know that extenders introduce latency and instability, which isn\u2019t great for PCVR. </code></pre> <p>I\u2019ve read that using a Wi-Fi 6 router is the way to go for wireless PCVR, so I\u2019m considering adding a second Wi-Fi 6 router in the room with my PC.
