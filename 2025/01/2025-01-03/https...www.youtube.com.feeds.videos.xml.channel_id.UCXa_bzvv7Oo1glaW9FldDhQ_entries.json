        "description": "The past few years of gaming have been exceptional, with high-profile exclusives, blockbusters, sequels, and memorable indie games. Sure, there's been the odd failure or three, but even in a \"lean\" year like 2024, there have been some big hits.\n\nHowever, it's time to look forward to the biggest releases in 2025 and onwards. Major titles like Assassin's Creed Shadows, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and Monster Hunter Wilds are some of the imminent heavy-hitters, but there are also games like The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2, Split Fiction, and many more to look forward to.\n\nOf course, you also have the likes of Fable, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Gears of War: E-Day, Atomfall, Ghost of Yotei, Grand Theft Auto 6, Mafia: The Old Country, and Borderlands 4 coming up. Regardless of your platform of choice, there's something for everyone. Check out 45 single-player games to look forward to in 2025 and beyond.",
