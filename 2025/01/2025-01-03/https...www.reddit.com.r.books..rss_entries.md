<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got this as a blind date with a book Christmas gift. I finished it in three sittings.. and was just left underwhelmed? </p> <p>I enjoyed the first half, but the back half was just a descent into madness and the end honestly felt like the author was like… how do I end this? and just did. It was generally predictable and felt like it was written to be either a Netflix movie or one of those shows where they’re like 4 episodes but each episode is an hour and a half long.</p> <p>It was a super quick and easy read for me. Maybe this just isn’t my genre? </p> <p>I’m not sure what I’m asking here, maybe I’m just looking for reassurance that it was a bland read. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YoureaLobstar"> /u/YoureaLobstar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hszvch/just_finished_malibu_rising_feeling_underwhelmed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.red

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have recently let myself get into it on different subs about books. Bad and good. And I had an epiphany of sorts and wanted to see if it resonated with anyone here. </p> <p>I will absolutely recommend bad books. And by bad, I mean ones that are poorly written, predictable, shallow, lack character development. If someone says to me, &quot;I&#39;m so tired of watching &#39;love is blind&#39;, I am shoving ACOTAR and everything Miller in their hands. Because the point, for me, is to match people with things THEY like and not just pontificate on what I enjoy.</p> <p>This is a new development btw. Years ago I would use a book recommendation to assert my reading prowess lol But now, I just want more people to read. Even if it&#39;s not what I like.

This should&#39;ve been obvious, but it was really interesting finding out the different ways people read. Some can visualize it, some can&#39;t, some people have to literally read every word with their inner voice, and others can read words silently (hard to explain).</p> <p>I honestly thought everyone reads like me, since everyone I know does it similar to me (maybe it&#39;s more common this way).

She is an excellent writer who did a lot of historical research for her novels. Many people love her and I understand why.</p> <p>Especially Here Be Dragons started out SO good. I was so intrigued and ready to call Penman the next GRRM with how she set up these characters. But when the love story started, I ended up hating that so much, and kind of stopped caring about any of the characters.

It was uncomfortable. </p> <p>Then her other book When Christ And His Saints Slept.

Just a lot of terrible people being sad and dramatic about their own choices. Charles is a bizarrely passive figure for a protagonist. Everything in his life just seems to happen to him and he goes along with it.

The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden.&quot;</p> <p>For me, Steinbeck gives me this feeling the most. His prose is simple and matter-of-fact, but he can evoke more empathy and understanding in two sentences than other authors manage with chapters of flowery prose.
