Join me on Monday 6th January for a LIVE episode of Justin Hawkins Rides Again, where I'll be debuting the new video for "I Hate Myself" - the latest single by The Darkness. I'll be here at 8.30pm GMT with my brother Dan Hawkins and we'll react to your reviews, likes, dislikes and comments. It's going to be a lot of fun...
