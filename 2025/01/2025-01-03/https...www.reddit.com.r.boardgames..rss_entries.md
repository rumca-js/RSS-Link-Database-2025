Cards against Humanity had just released and quickly overran most groups, game nights, and gettogethers. It was a wild time indeed for board games, but with how CAH dominated the space for years, I decided to focus on my career and other hobbies for a while.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Fast asymmetrical game: three dwarves face one dragon on a small hexagonal board. Core mechanics is hand management: both players use action cards to move, attack and use some special abilities.</p> <p>Dragon is much more powerful than any dwarf, however dwarves have ways of weakening him: disabling his abilities by destroying corresponding body parts, or immobilizing him with net, for example. They should beware of his area attacks and action cards with high damage, though.</p> <p>Overall Drako reminds me a bit Neuroshima Hex (especially if you play Mefisto vs Dancers :-)) or even Gloomhaven (tiny duel version of Gloomhaven).

One north and one south on each side, to allow snapping whichever way they are placed. I wanted weak magnets so the pieces would not stick together, but rather snap to align. Thought it could be a fun project. But have anyone tried this?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking to add to the collection, as I&#39;m getting tired of the current games we have. Games need to be easy enough for seniors, but still fun for the rest of the adults. I&#39;m hesitant to say child level, but the older grandma gets the lighter weight we need to go. I can&#39;t stand games that &quot;play themselves&quot; (think Life). Current collection is more expansive than the average family, with titles including:</p> <p>-Just one</p> <p>-Blanking on the name - just say no? (trick taking card game, 35 cards, remove 9, beads to pass on card)</p> <p>-Quacks of quedlinburg (my favorite. about the most advanced game we can play, with some minor confusion)</p> <p>-Ticket to ride</p> <p>-Horrified (again, some confusion here)</p> <p>-century golems</p> <p>-rummikub</p> <p>-sequence</p> <p>-mantis</p> <p>-letter jam (great game but grandma doesn&#39;t like)</p> <p>-just about all the &quot;mainstream&quot; games the average home would have.

So #2 would say “Pandemic Legacy” and then in small font #2 - S1, #52 - S0, #61 - S2</p> <p>Dune: imperium and Uprising - Combine #6 Dune Imperium (#19 Up

The WHO and WHERE were not difficult, however, we do not know how we were supposed to deduce WHAT based on the information. We reduced it to 2 possibilities. Maybe we were supposed to intuit that one of them was too big for the hiding spot? The really baffling thing is that the artifact cards had colorful rectangles at the bottom that seemed to correspond to a code, but there was nothing about them anywhere in the game. The colors also didn&#39;t even correspond to the character colors.</span> </p> <p>So what did we miss?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HiRedditItsMe

Take-that mechanics don&#39;t bother us. I would also try a co-op game, but we haven&#39;t really had an interest in them.</li> <li>Replayability is big for us.

She enjoys a lot of tableau builders. </li> <li>We mostly play 2 player games, but would enjoy sharing the game with a couple other friends, so it would be great (but not required) if the game can support more.</li> <li>My wife and I are very thematically driven.

I&#39;m thinking there must be communities that have optimized similar concepts to a more refined degree. For example the &quot;debt meta&quot; that&#39;s prevalent in twilight imperium, even though theres no such thing as debt in the game itself, is a purely political optimization to the underlying game. There&#39;s also competitive mafia, where the whole red/black system has taken over, and mislabeling how &quot;black&quot; a player is can cause the entire game to be solved within a few turns by stronger players.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My friends and I have played Inis probably two dozen times over the past few years. We love it, but have regularly encountered the same annoying &quot;feels-bad&quot; situation.</p> <p>A round ends when everyone passes in succession. A game ends when someone is representing a victory at the end of a round. Often, player A is representing a victory on the table and passes. Players B and C also pass, forcing player D to take an action to prevent the game from ending with a player A win. This is a little &quot;prisoners dilemma&quot; - players B and C could help prevent the player A from winning, but they&#39;re incentivized to hold their cards and let player D bleed their hand dry before they actually do anything to address the player A&#39;s victory.</p> <p>How have you dealt with this situation in Inis? Is player D justified if they call player B and C&#39;s bluff and just choose to end the game and lose rather than be forced to play out all their ca

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>We recently found out we have friends who live about 4 minutes away from us who also love board games! </p> <p>During New Years Eve (over a game of 7W Architects), we discussed doing some more game nights regularly to which my wife mentioned how much fun we had with Pandemic Legacy. The ever changing board, losing and gaining new cards each play, etc. </p> <p>With that, are there any other good legacy or campaign type games you’d recommend? It must not be super long in terms of each play session-couple hours is fine but I’m not looking for a punch-you-in-the-face 12 hour game session. Also ideal if it can be broken down in between plays, similar to how after a month of pandemic legacy it just goes back Into the box and the change happens the next playthrough. </p> <p>Sorry if this type of game is pretty common knowledge, this style of hane was new to my wife and I in 2024 and are really excited about doing something similar with friends

Does Invincible offer unique gameplay or mechanics that Astro Knights doesn’t? A lot of “best of 2024” lists I’ve seen have Invincible the card game on their lists which I find funny since I recall when Astro Knights came out it wasn’t really mentioned. Is it just the IP that people prefer?</p> <p>I guess it could be similar to LOTR 7 Wonders Duel vs 7 Wonders - if you own one, no sense in getting the other. </p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts if you’ve played both. Is it worth adding Invincible to my collection, or does it feel too similar to Astro Knights? </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3
