President-elect Donald Trump will begin his second term with a trifecta: a Republican-controlled House and Senate, exactly how he began his first term. But this time a narrower majority and a hollowed-out center might mean the Trumpiest Congress ever might fail to deliver his agenda. Republicans and Democrats have each retreated more into their own camps, making the possibility for dealmaking even more narrow. 

WSJ explores why Trump may have a difficult time getting funding for his different policies like his immigration and deportation plans and his tax cuts.
