In today's Daily Fix:
News of a new Nintendo patent has fueled more speculation about the upcoming—but not officially announced—Switch 2. The patent suggests the Switch 2 will use some kind of AI-powered image upscaling (probably similar to NVIDIA DLSS), which falls in line with leaks about the system's specs. The Switch 2 supposedly will output games at 4K in docked mode, and upscaling the images from a lower resolution to 4K will help save on system horsepower. In other news, Call of Duty players are finally learning what their SBMM rank is, thanks to a workaround involving requesting personal data from Activision. But the question now is, what will you do once you learn what your SBMM ranking is? And finally, Atari has re-revealed a handheld that will likely play retro Atari games. Grandpas of the world, rejoice.
