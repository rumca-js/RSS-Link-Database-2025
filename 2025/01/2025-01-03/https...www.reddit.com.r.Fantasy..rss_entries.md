<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A foreword to Reddit: I usually only post my year-end reading recommendations for close friends and family on my relatively limited social media accounts, but this year I wanted to attempt to share with a broader audience. I admittedly don&#39;t post here often, but hopefully I can add something to the community with my writings. If you have your own thoughts about the books I have read, I welcome the discussion!</p> <p>---</p> <p>In what is becoming something of an annual tradition of mine, I sat down mid-December and started thinking about the year I had experienced in reading. I keep a journal where I count up the books and jot down some quick thoughts for myself, which extends my memory a bit. In truth though, the books that impacted me the most tend to stick in my mind. It is these that made it to this list, to which I then refer a reader not unlike myself seeking out <em>more.</em></p> <p>With that thought in mind, I would like to approach my r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been a lurker for a little while now and I admittedly don&#39;t really fool around with forums and online posting much. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve hit a bit of a brick wall as of late trying to find some fantasy content that aligns with my interests. My only issue is that it seems my taste in fantasy is quite niche, or at least it seems that way to me these days, and I don&#39;t really know where else to look for recommendations.</p> <p>Basically, I love fantasy stories where the POV protagonist (is that the right way to say it?) is just some random doofus who gets thrown into an adventure because it overlaps with a personal goal or due to a secondary character who has their own defined goal. Think Bilbo Baggins as a perfect and general example. I know Gandalf had dealings with the Took family in the past, but Bilbo really was just minding his own business and then all of a sudden, he finds himself on a journey to defeat 

## High fantasy based on African mythology, preferrably by African author?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was thinking of how European high fantasy commonly extrapolates like an idealized or some times dystopian mythological past based on European history and mythos. I was wondering if there are fantasy novels which extrapolate the myths and history of different African cultures to epic like fantasy proportions? And I mean sub-Saharan, not like Egyptian or otherwise Mediterranean. And preference to African authors, because I believe they might have some insight to the cultures that others might not have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Toby_Forrester"> /u/Toby_Forrester </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hsxfwa/high_fantasy_based_on_african_mythology/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hsxfwa/high_fantasy_based_on_african_mythology/">[comments]</a></span>

I&#39;ve always been a lot more attuned to weirder speculative fiction, especially magical realism, &quot;literary&quot; fantasy (a term I loathe but it&#39;s what I got), and science fantasy. I&#39;m not one for escapism, which is what I associate epic fantasy with (perhaps erroneously?), and in my experience, a lot of epic fantasy has been more escapist. I really like books that are challenging and brain-stimulating, which is what I want after a long day at work or mountaineering training.</p> <p>That being said, I&#39;ve read a few epic fantasy works this past year that were right up my alley. I&#39;m also trying to read a greater breadth of speculative fiction, so I want to use 2025 to explore more worlds (literally/figuratively). I might be biased against epic fantasy, but I&#

Here are a few caveats I have when choosing a book right now:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>No R*pe plotlines</strong> - If it is something that was in a character’s past or only alluded to, then that’s fine, but otherwise, I don’t want any scenes of it happening while I read.</p></li> <li><p><strong>No Video-Game Magic Systems</strong> - I’m not against hard magic in particular; I would just rather not read a book where the magic system is explained in far too much detail.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of my favourite reads from 2024 was <em>A Day of Fallen Night</em> of Samantha Shannon, and the worldbuilding is among my numerous praises. This worldbuilding is notably based on real-world myths and tales and the inspirations range from East Asia to Europe. However, as much as I have enjoyed Wulf&#39;s character arc, I couldn&#39;t help thinking that the nordic part of this world feels like a transposition of a Nordic/Viking based setting (with different names) rather than an inspiration?</p> <p>I probably feel like that because there have been so many fictions over the last decade based on Nordic/Viking culture. I love <em>Skyrim</em> despite its flaws, and this inspiration is at the core of the game, which has probably started a trend. Obvious examples are the <em>Vikings</em> TV shows (though more historical, at least in theory), <em>How to Train your Dragons,</em> <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed: Valhalla, God of War: Ragnarok,</em> and more recent

Hope to be able to find some good reads!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Complete-Slice2878"> /u/Complete-Slice2878 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hsf18m/searching_for_antihero_fantasy_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hsf18m/searching_for_antihero_fantasy_books/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, hello, hi!</p> <p>I recently read the LOTR for the first time, the entire trilogy. I loved it! Been a fan of the movies for quite some time and decided to see what Tolkien in text/prose was all about. Boy, what a ride! His command over language, from a linguistic level is just on another level, in my opinion. I just didn&#39;t want it to end!</p> <p>That being said, I kinda want to read more fantasy. It&#39;s a genre I&#39;ve neglected all my life. </p> <p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for, I guess:</p> <ol> <li><p>I need a book in a series that&#39;s at least 40 books long and, at minimum, each book containing 1200 pages in length.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So yeah, I started &quot;The Chaos Balance&quot; when i was first getting into fantasy, no idea this was a series, just had a cover in the style I like and I thought it was...interesting...but fell off it, but something about it always made me curious, so I did research and learned that this is a 20+ book series taking place over like 2000 years and every book takes place at a different time period jumping around at seemingly random time periods with connections, a few &quot;Mini series&quot; books that have sequels, and one day while in a used book store I saw &quot;The Magic of Recluse&quot; the first book in the series and picked it up on a lark.</p> <p>And I was hooked by page one, SO good, LOVED it, like this is the kind of book I wish I got to read when I was a younger man. I just love how it&#39;s a story about a young directionless man who needs to find his place in life because he doesn&#39;t fit in with the rigid expectations of his parents

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! Happy new year.</p> <p>Last year I made a post telling about how my reading-year was and I kind of enjoyed it, so I decided I&#39;m going to do it again (I would like to say every year but... I&#39;m not that consistent... xD).</p> <p>My last year &#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/18yh127/my_2023_recommendationsreviews_and_plans_for_2024/">post</a> was divided into my reviews and my plans for 2024. I&#39;ll like to say I followed them and I read those books that have been in my bucket list for years but... I just didn&#39;t. Found new books and... well you all know. So I&#39;ll just start with the list I&#39;ve read.</p> <p>All the spoilers are tagged as spoilers. In the plain text there won&#39;t be any. Have that in mind if you write a comment.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Happy new year everyone! I&#39;m trying to nail down my reading goal for the year and looking for inspiration based on what the rest of you choose to do with your goals. Do you come up with any creative ways to motivate your reading year?</p> <p>I don&#39;t do plain number goals (like &quot;read 50 books&quot;) because they kind of stress me out. In 2023 I made a goal to read the full backlist of 5 of my favorite authors, which I achieved. In 2024 I wanted to complete my entire physical TBR which I also achieved. In both cases, I wrote down all the books involved on a big whiteboard and got to cross things off as I finished them throughout the year. It&#39;s a simple strategy, but fun to watch my progress develop over the months. </p> <p>This year I have a general list of books and series by new-to-me authors that I want to try, but that&#39;s not as concrete as tackling my physical TBR was. I also want to always read from my public library first bef

For those unfamiliar with the series, it is a world that superheroes and villains have created an uneasy truce on, The villains have effectively restricted themselves to white collar crime and avoiding prosecution for their crimes in exchange for keeping a low profile as well as keeping the rest of the costumed evil doers in line. It&#39;s a reasonably lighthearted series with most of the villains not being that bad except for exceptional brutality to those people that break the rules or threaten their few loved ones. I&#39;m a big fan as I write my own &quot;supervillain with a heart of gold&quot; series and am always on the look for more.</p> <p>Honestly,
