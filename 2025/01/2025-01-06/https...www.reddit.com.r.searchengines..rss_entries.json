So you are searching the whole internet, not only your area.<br/> I&#39;m also searching for a tool, which gives me the opportunity to use searchengines, which doesn&#39;t have a english ui. E.g. the korean NAVER. I would like to have a tool, which translates the UI, the results and my inputs.<br/> Is there something available like this ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HansWurstikustik\"> /u/HansWurstikustik </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1hv3o5s/searchengine_location_independent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1hv3o5s/searchengine_location_independent/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A common answer is : &quot;The best alternative depends on what you&#39;re looking for. If you want Google-quality results with privacy, try Startpage. For environmental impact, choose Ecosia. For complete privacy, <strong>DuckDuckGo or Brave Search are excellent options</strong>.&quot;<br/> Duckduckgo sucks, you&#39;re looking for something and it presents you something you don&#39;t want. Brave is more or less but limited in images to show up. Kagi Search would be an option but you got to go paying for it... So, what do you think about Startpage? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Slight-Captain-43\"> /u/Slight-Captain-43 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1huzwfb/its_startpage_a_good_and_reliable_search_engine/\">[link]</a></",
