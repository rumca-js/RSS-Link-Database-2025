The new AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D CPUs were announced, alongside the new Radeon RX 9070 XT and 9070 GPUs from AMD announced to the press. The company also unveiled its Z2 Extreme, Z2, and Z2 Go SOC solutions for handheld gaming devices like presumably a future Steam Deck (all but confirmed) and ASUS ROG Ally, alongside use in a confirmed Lenovo Legion Go iteration. The company also announced mobile parts, like the seemingly captcha-themed naming of the 9955HX3D. In total, specs are limited for all but the CPUs. We'll be reviewing them soon enough.\n\nGet the LIMITED 2024 Disappointment Shirt in Cotton: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/disappointment-pc-2024-oxidized-design-cotton\nOr in a highly breathable Tri-Blend! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/disappointment-pc-2024-oxidized-design-triblend\n\nLike our cont",
