Standard Dell machines are aimed at general consumers and designed for school, work and casual gaming. (Alienware gaming PCs are also getting updated names, but they will remain separate from Dell\u2019s core computing products.) Then there are Dell Pro devices, which are primarily for businesses and meant to support pro-grade productivity. Finally, there is the Dell Pro Max line, which as its name suggests comprises systems built to deliver maximum performance (i.e. workstations).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/0dc46310-cc57-11ef-93ff-",

While specifics are scarce, the company says its new GPUs will be built on a 4nm process with &quot;optimized&quot; compute units, &quot;supercharged&quot; AI computation and better ray tracing per compute unit. The big reveal, though, is that its new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR4) will be powered by machine learning, just like NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology. AMD claims FSR 4 will offer &quot;high quality&quot; 4K upscaling, frame generation and low latency support with AMD Anti-Lag 2.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/75b988a0-cc53-11ef-beff-9c6d884724a7\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-01/75b988a0-cc53-11ef-beff-9c6d884724a7\" style=\"height:946px;width:1700px;\" alt=\"AMD RDNA 4\" data-uuid=\"1436835f-8358-3ecd-b9b7-c32f40ab5fd6\"><figcapti",

Swiss startup Nutrix AG is hoping a quick, at-home spit test can help, by giving people a better idea of how stressed out they really are and the tools to manage it. At CES 2025, Nutrix showed off its cortiSense device, which measures levels of cortisol in saliva and can be used to track how this changes over time. The startup is planning to launch it by the end of the year, and it\u2019ll work with the gSense app and digital platform to offer things like personalized wellness coaching from a medical team.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s meant to be an easy and noninvasive way to identify and combat burnout. The part that\u2019s a little sus, though? In a press release, Nutrix CEO Maria Hahn said the company is focusing on \u201cempowering enterprises,\" noting that employee burnout can present \u201ca significant challenge with a huge human and financial cost.\u201d So, get your stress under control to better perform labor, I guess.</p>",

Maybe it\u2019s not the stress that\u2019s changed, but that we\u2019re more able than ever to notice, monitor and analyze what\u2019s going on in our bodies. Here at CES 2025, startup Eli Health is launching Hormometer, an at-home kit that tests your <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-20-sensor-measures-stress-hormones-in-your-sweat.html\">cortisol</a> and progesterone levels.</p>\n<p>Hormometer is a wand with a collection tip at one end that you hold in your mouth for 60 seconds. Once it\u2019s absorbed your spit, you\u2019ll sit it down on a table for 20 minutes while the cartridge\u2019s network of built-in microfluidics gets to work. After that, the assay will start displaying lines in a specific color, which can be read and interpreted by your smartphone camera.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The app will then be able to, presumably once it\u2019s establish",

Our war room is open, the team has been seeing products and the coverage will ramp up in just a few short hours. Still, the show doesn't officially kick off for a couple of days, since the convention center is only truly open on January 7. But we'll have plenty of press conferences to cover tomorrow, and companies are already holding somewhat secretive briefings to preview their news.</p>\n<p>Based on our experience, as well as observation of recent industry trends, it\u2019s fairly easy to make educated predictions about what we might see here. Over the years, the focus of the conference has spanned areas like TVs, cars, smart home products and personal health, with a smattering of laptops and accessories thrown in.
