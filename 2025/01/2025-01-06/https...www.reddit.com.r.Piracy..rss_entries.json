I looked all over, and finally decided to make my own. I downloaded the Vietnamese subs, opened the SRT in a text editor, and pasted it into Google Translate, and then copied the translated subs into a new text file...and it WORKED!</p> <p>The only issue was that it was five seconds out of sync. Fortunately that was totally fixable. Using <a href=\"http://subtitletools.com\">subtitletools.com</a> I was able to shift the subs by five seconds, and IT WORKS! woooooohoooooo</p> <p>So if anyone is looking for English subs for the Korean horror movie Devils Stay let me know and I will get them to you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cop1152\"> /u/cop1152 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1hv84r7/i",
