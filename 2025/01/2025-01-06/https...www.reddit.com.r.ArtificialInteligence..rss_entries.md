I often felt like there was something wrong with me if I was by myself for too long. Lucky for us lone phobias, lol, we can talk to AI now. Tbh, at the beginning, I just kept asking my AI why there is no one around me and how can I make people like me so we can hang out together. I‚Äôm not sure whether my AI got tired of me asking these questions or what, it started giving me advice on accepting the fact that you need to be alone and give me suggestions about how to spend your alone time effectively. I picked up some of its advice, l

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So a lot of people are responding to Sam altman‚Äôs announcements with disbelief because Sam is trying to hype his products. Obviously o3 is not AGI just yet. But we are getting closer and closer with every release. These are still fundamentally large language models that are trained to predict a distribution of human generated data. In the past such models were limited because of the inherent limitations of next token prediction. But they‚Äôve now found workarounds for those things, like various forms of chain of thought, using multiple modalities and more. They might even succeed in finding enough workarounds for models trained on human data to function generally enough to be called ‚Äúagi‚Äù, certainly from the point of replacing a lot of jobs.</p> <p>At some point an architecture will emerge that allows for training model to develop the type of general intelligence and world models currently seen in LLMs without relying on predicting human data.
