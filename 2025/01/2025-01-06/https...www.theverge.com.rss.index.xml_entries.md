  <p>Is Samsung’s round robot finally ready to roll out of CES demos and into actual homes? </p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NzedJH">Ballie, the rolling robot that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030713/samsung-ballie-robot-projector-ai-ces">reemerged at CES last year</a>, will be shipping to consumers as an actual product sometime in 2025. That’s what Samsung is saying at the moment, anyway.

  <p id="Xp7h1a">LG and Samsung have both announced their 2025 smart TVs at CES this weekend, and some of them will include access to Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant. Both TV manufacturers are chasing the artificial intelligence hype train with dedicated AI sections on their smart TVs that include a shortcut to a Copilot web app.</p>
<p id="GEj0v9">LG is adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336168/lg-2025-oled-tv-m5-g5-c5-b5-features-specs">an entire AI section</a> to its TVs and rebranding its remote to “AI Remote,” in an effort to sell consumers on the promise of large language models.

  <p id="jncCGe">OWC has released two new super-long <a href="https://www.owc.com/solutions/usb4-cables">active optical USB4 cables</a>, available in lengths of nearly 10 feet (3 meters) and 15 feet (4.5 meters) and offering up to 40Gbps of data throughput. According to OWC’s press materials, they’ll set you back $98.99 and $129.99, respectively, though its website currently lists them for slightly less. That’s a bargain, compared to what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23057158/apple-thunderbolt-4-cable-3-meter-on-sale-price-usb-4">Apple is charging</a>.</p>

  <p id="NMw0d3">L’Oréal is hoping its latest beauty gadget can demystify skincare. At CES 2025, the company announced Cell BioPrint, a device that’s designed to analyze your skin and give personalized advice on how to slow down signs of aging. </p>
