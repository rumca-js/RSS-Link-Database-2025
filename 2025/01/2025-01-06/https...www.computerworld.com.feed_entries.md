<p>Christmas Eve (and Christmas Day) are arguably <em>the </em>most important time-frame for transportation companies. So it was a big deal when an American Airlines system glitch forced the airline to ask the government for a full shutdown on Christmas Eve. And it was an even bigger deal the next day for <a href="https://www.banenor.no/en/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.banenor.no/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bane NOR</a>, which runs the Norwegian rail system and had to shut down all trains in Norway.</p>



<p>Both involved IT issues and both were mostly — if not entirely — caused by third-party firms. Now, third-party risks are nothing new. But few CIOs truly internali

<p>Does the rise of artificial intelligence represent more of an opportunity for the world — or a curse? Because for all the clamor about boosted productivity and enhanced human potential, there’s also the rising demand for energy, processor power, memory requirements and ever more bloat on the machine.</p>



<p>Just look at Apple Intelligence, which now demands almost <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/03/apple-intelligence-now-requires-almost-double-iphone-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twice as much data storage</a> on your devices than was originally advertised.</p>



<p>I fear that’s the thin end of this cursed wedge. And it’s not as though storage is the only demand

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed the chip industry since its mainstream arrival over the past two years, driving demand for specialized processors, accelerating design innovation, and reshaping global supply chains and markets.</p>



<p>The generative AI (genAI) revolution that began with OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in late 2022 continues to push the limits of AI inference, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) and semiconductor technologies. In short order, traditional CPUs, insufficient for AI’s parallel processing needs, have given way to speciali
