A groundbreaking study on hypernuclei, led by Ulf-G. Meißner from the Institute for Advanced Simulation, uses nuclear lattice effective field theory to explore the interactions of Λ-hyperons within atomic nuclei. The research, published in The European Physical Journal A, provides key insights into the forces that shape hypernuclei and their potential role in neutron stars. By applying advanced computational methods, the team has made significant strides in understanding these rare, short-lived structures. Their findings could offer new perspectives on the extreme conditions in neutron stars, where hyperons may influence fundamental stellar properties

## Is the Wheel of Ghosts an Ancient Observatory? New Study Suggests Otherwise

The ancient Rujm el-Hiri site, known as the "Wheel of Ghosts," has long been thought to serve as an astronomical observatory. However, a recent study published in Remote Sensing raises questions about this theory, suggesting that geodynamic changes over millions of years have altered its alignment. Researchers from Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University used geophysical and remote sensing methods to propose that the site’s original purpose was likely agricultural or herding, rather than astronomical. This new perspective opens up further discussion about the broader role of the site in the Golan Heights

Mathematicians at New York University have delved into the science behind hula hooping, revealing that body shape plays a crucial role in maintaining the hoop's motion against gravity. Through experiments using miniature robotic models with different body shapes, the team demonstrated that specific physical attributes—such as sloping hips and a curvy waist—are key to successfully keeping the hoop elevated. Their findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, not only explain the physics of hula hooping but also offer insights that could benefit energy harvesting technologies and improve robotic positioners in manufacturing

Paleontologists in Uruguay have uncovered fossils of mesosaurs that exceed previous size records, revealing that these ancient reptiles may have grown to lengths of up to 2.5 metres. The specimens, found in the Mangrullo Formation, include fragmentary skulls and other bones, offering a glimpse into the gigantism that occurred in mature mesosaurs. Researchers believe that these larger sizes reflect ontogenetic growth patterns rather than environmental influences such as temperature or food availability. The study also examines how volcanic activity and desertification during the Permian period may have contributed to the extinction of these once-thriving aquatic reptiles

## Research Shows Twin Births Were Common in Ancient Primate Evolution

Research suggests that ancient primates, including early humans, typically gave birth to twins, a common trait in their evolutionary history. Over time, singletons became more prevalent due to the survival advantages of larger, more developed offspring. This shift is linked to the evolution of primates' larger brains and bodies, requiring more energy and care. Modern trends show an increase in twin births, partly due to advances in medical technologies and delayed pregnancies.

Recent research reveals that chimpanzees select stone tools for cracking nuts in ways that may reflect techniques used by ancient human ancestors. The study observed how chimpanzees chose rocks for hammers and anvils based on their mechanical properties, such as hardness, shape, and elasticity, rather than their appearance. This mirrors the tool selection behaviours of early hominins, who lived around 2.5 million years ago. The research also highlighted that younger chimpanzees often adopt the tool choices of older individuals, suggesting a form of knowledge transfer that may parallel early human social learning. Published in the Journal of Human Evolution, these findings provide new insights into the evolution of tool use in both chimps and humans

A recent study challenges the long-standing belief that the Roman Empire’s decline was caused by volcanic eruptions and the Justinianic plague. Instead, the research reveals that the eastern Roman Empire, during the 6th century, experienced significant growth in population and trade. This new perspective, drawn from large-scale archaeological data, debunks earlier claims based on isolated case studies. Contrary to previous reports, the study found that the empire thrived, with increased naval commerce and prosperity.
