<p>It’s perhaps not a surprise, but demand for AI-related skills has soared, according to technology educator O’Reilly, which just released its annual technology trends report. By contrast, interest in programming languages <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3615556/python-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever.html">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3491404/jdk-24-the-new-features-in-java-24.html">Java</a> has taken a bit of a nosedive, the company reports.</p>

<p>Over the last year, we’ve seen an explosion in innovation in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3543468/5-ways-companies-can-use-time-series-forecasting.html">time-series forecasting</a>.

The pre-trained models make time-series forecasting more accessible and available, especially to smaller organizations wit

<p>Over the past two years, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/generative-ai">generative AI</a> has been a force for transformation—and disruption—everywhere it’s landed. Education was no exception; if anything, schools were among the first institutions to grapple with AI’s implications. As students embraced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAKHMUx9IPI">ChatGPT</a> and similar AI technologies for research, test preparation, and academic writing assistance, among other things, educators found themselves at the forefront of a sweeping societal change—and a growing ethical dilemma: Should AI-assisted learning be accepted as a new normal in education, or are students <a href="https://www.nytim

<p>2024 was a year filled with AI possibilities; 2025 needs to turn those possibilities into realities. For that, we need the cloud companies to stop churning out “primitives” such as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709489/large-language-models-the-foundations-of-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) and instead give developers solutions. In mid-2024 <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337160/we-need-a-red-hat-for-ai.html">I suggested we need a “Red Hat for AI,”</a> a company that can deliver “more trust (open models) and fewer moving parts (opinionated platforms that require guesswork to choose and apply models).”</p>



<p>I still think that’s what we need. If
