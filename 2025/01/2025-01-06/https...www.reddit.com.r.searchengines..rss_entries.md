<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering, if there is any searchengine or tool, which makes it possible to get results out of any country, without having to choose or even use a vpn. So you are searching the whole internet, not only your area.<br/> I&#39;m also searching for a tool, which gives me the opportunity to use searchengines, which doesn&#39;t have a english ui. E.g. the korean NAVER. I would like to have a tool, which translates the UI, the results and my inputs.<br/> Is there something available like this ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HansWurstikustik"> /u/HansWurstikustik </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1hv3o5s/searchengine_location_independent/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1hv3o5s/searchengine_location_independent/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing some research in regard of search engines outcome, and always by far Google Search seems to be overall any of them. A common answer is : &quot;The best alternative depends on what you&#39;re looking for. If you want Google-quality results with privacy, try Startpage. For environmental impact, choose Ecosia. For complete privacy, <strong>DuckDuckGo or Brave Search are excellent options</strong>.&quot;<br/> Duckduckgo sucks, you&#39;re looking for something and it presents you something you don&#39;t want. Brave is more or less but limited in images to show up. Kagi Search would be an option but you got to go paying for it... So, what do you think about Startpage? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slight-Captain-43"> /u/Slight-Captain-43 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1huzwfb/its_startpage_a_good_and_reliable_search_engine/">[link]</a></
