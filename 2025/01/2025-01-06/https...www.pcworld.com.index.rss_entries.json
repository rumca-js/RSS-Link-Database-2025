This thing is almost a literal brick, at least in terms of size and weight, albeit a fashionable one. HP didn\u2019t provide me with dimensions at the presentation, but it\u2019s approximately the size of a two-drive NAS setup, or maybe one-third as small as the smallest Mini-ITX desktop I\u2019ve seen. Much bigger than a typical \u201cmini PC\u201d sold to consumers, yet still a fraction of the size of a conventional desktop PC.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"up",

The home security company has seemed much more interested in bringing features like the radar motion detection that powers its higher-end cameras\u2019 Birds Eye View feature than boosting video resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Ring\u2019s announcement at CES that a simple firmware update will enable these ostensibly 1080p cameras to start capturing video in 2K resolution left us wondering how that could be possible. Well, it turns out both cameras, introduced in 2022 and 2021 respectively, were manufactured with 2K image sensors at the outset. Ring has simply been throttling them to 1920 x 1080",
