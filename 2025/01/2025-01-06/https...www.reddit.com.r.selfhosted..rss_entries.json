I really dig the idea of having a smart room but honestly, I hate apple home kit, alexa, philips hue lights and these kind of proprietary bullshit products that just make you use their apps.</p> <p>I have a protocol in mind that would allow me to easily add gadgets to my smart home, but one thing I can&#39;t think of is, how do I control the light. </p> <p>In a perfect world, I imagine I would have a bulb that listens on a port for a request. That way it wouldn&#39;t matter if I controlled it using a c script or a web application. Do you know if there&#39;s something like that? Is there a smart light bulb I could control like that? Also, any tips and recommendations are welcome. I haven&#39;t done anything like this but I&#39;m really hyped up. I know I have the programming and electronics skills to pull this off.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",

An example with particularly problematic ZFS-on-root install is examined as it is not supported by regular Live Debian and it is rather non-intuitive. As part of the demonstration, a fast full host backup (no guests) resulting in ~1G archive is taken and sent out over SSH - format that will allow for flexible redeployment in a follow-up guide.

Currently I use the scan2mail solution which gives me a pdf which I sent to adobe&#39;s free tier acrobat api to OCR it, remove empty pages, fix rotation, brightness etc., as I now want to change my mailsystem (Office365, + PowerAutomate for sending to Adobe) I would like to change this to something selfhosted. I already played with paperless-ngx, but somehow could not really get into it, I&#39;m preferring a more file/folder based approach and therefore only searching for some pdf optimization tool.
