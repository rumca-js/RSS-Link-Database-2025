Today, on the first Matt Walsh Show of 2025, passengers on the subway in New York are being stabbed, assaulted, pushed in front of trains, and now burned alive. New York’s solution to that problem is to impose taxes that force more of its citizens down into the tunnels where the psychotic hobos are lurking. Also, Joe Biden awards the Medal of Freedom to Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Darth Vader, and other assorted supervillains. Biden also commutes the death sentences of every inmate on federal death row—except three. Why are those three out of luck? And for what is perhaps the most important Daily Cancelation I’ve ever done on this show, I must cancel Sonic the Hedgehog.
