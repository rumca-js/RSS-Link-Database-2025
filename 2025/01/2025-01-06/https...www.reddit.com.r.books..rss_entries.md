<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>&quot;Livesuit&quot; is a novella set in the Captive&#39;s War universe created by James S.A Corey, the writer(s) of the Expanse books and Netflix series. The novella is only the second book in Cory&#39;s series, and I am very much enjoying it. It&#39;s a thought-provoking and inventive novella challenging readers to consider the impact of technology on personal identity and societal values. The novel raises philosophical questions about selfhood, agency, and the consequences of living in an augmented reality. It’s a good pick for speculative fiction fans with a philosophical edge and is designed to enhance the Captive&#39;s War series. I&#39;m looking forward to the next installment. Is anyone else following this series?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveRT78"> /u/SteveRT78 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hvckj5/livesuit_by_james_sa_corey/">[link]</a></span>

## Do you pirate books? If so, how do you feel about it, ethically?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always felt a bit guilty pirating books and taking money from writers. But outside of the US and the UK its hard to get books that aren&#39;t mainstream romance, self-help or YA. People who pirate books were likely not to buy it in the first place. At the same time, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good justification for piracy, especially as writing careers tends to become cheaper and less paid for. What do you guys think?</p> <p>Edit: I feel like people people who keep mentioning libraries aren&#39;t getting the point that it&#39;s hard to get books you&#39;ll actually read. I grew up in a country that had no libraries at all and only recently moved to a different country that mostly has books in in another language. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PaperSense"> /u/PaperSense </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hvbwfk/do_you_pirate_books_if_so_how_do_you_fe

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Returning to <em>The Skystone</em> after first reading it in the 90s, I was eager to see if it still held up to my memory of enjoyment and I was delighted to find that it does. Jack Whyte’s writing remains as compelling as ever, weaving a gripping historical narrative with a masterful command of language that few authors achieve.</p> <p>The story unfolds like a well-crafted meal, serving up an engaging mix of ideal heroes, villains, and intrigue, all set against the backdrop of a crumbling Roman Britain. The mystery of the Skystone itself and the legacy of the protagonist’s family add layers of depth that make the book feel both immersive and rewarding. Whyte has a knack for making coincidences feel purposeful, turning potential plot holes into clever solutions through secret plots, hidden items, and well-timed revelations. His battles and adventures are rich in detail, creating a landscape that is both historically evocative and narratively satisfyi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished reading The Forty Rules of Love by Elif Shafak. It kept me fairly engrossed and I really wanted to see how the story unfolded. The writing is beautiful but it didn&#39;t move me as deeply as other romance novels have. I guess the fact that you already know the ending from the start affects the level of emotional investment. Or maybe I just couldn&#39;t relate with the characters on a personal level. The most emotion I felt was probably from (spoiler alert-) the ending. </p> <p>That said, this book definitely made me reflect on my life choices. It gradually made me feel like I could take a plunge, especially regarding my work and what I want to do in life. Now it could be the book or just the point of life I&#39;m at. So I&#39;m a little curious to know if anyone else experienced something similar while reading this book. Did it make you reconsider or just look closer at any aspects of your life or maybe make any bold decisions?</p> </di

She is one of the most favourite authors where I am from and I do love her books.</p> <p>That said, I am perfectly aware that not everything she writes is gold, some of the books in her Haunted houses series are really good, some are not, some are just average (I honestly forgot a chunk of it but those I loved, I loved unconditionally).</p> <p>I think her non-genre books are the best. The stand alone books that have a detective story in it. </p> <p>I feel like she is...sort of a candy, that is SO good to taste, addictive, the taste stays with you for a short time but you just want more :D </p> <p>But she can also describe everything so well. The atmosphere, the characters who seem scatchy at first but then you get some idea who they are. For me, however, majority of her characters are young women, I think when she has a man as a main character, she kind of can write them better (sadly, there are not many male c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wow! It&#39;s January 6th, 2025, and I already feel confident saying I won’t read a better book this year. Norwegian Wood might be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Maybe it’s recency bias talking, but honestly, I can’t remember the last time a book left me feeling this way—both during and after reading it. It’s simply masterful.</p> <p>This is the first book I’ve read by Haruki Murakami, and I’m already convinced he’s one of my favourite authors. That might sound premature, but I have no doubt I’ll be diving into more of his works in the future.</p> <p>Norwegian Wood is fantastic. It’s relatively short, yet it conveys so much emotion and tells its story with remarkable precision. I wouldn’t change a single thing.</p> <p>At its core, the book could be described as a love story or romance, but it’s so much more than that. It’s a meditation on life itself and the human experience. The ups and downs of existence are perfectly distilled into this nar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got this book on my TBR mainly because some reviews pegged it &quot;similar to Becky Chambers&quot;. But it was quite different, but good. Two things made me question my awareness. One was the trauma the trans MC goes through. It was pervasive and deep. And the book is set in California&#39;s San Gabriel Valley. I thought CA would is a progressive place where trans people did not face much problems. I am not American for the record and lived there only for a short while some years ago. </p> <p>Two - I did not really get what was the terms of the deal Shizuka made with the demon?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Happy New Year all!</p> <p>This was my first foray into Murakami, an author I regularly see recommended here. I figured I would start at the beginning of his bibliography and progress from there. Hear the Wind Sing is more of a novella, but it packs a quick punch. It is layered. The prose here was quite beautiful as advertised, and covers a span of 18 days of the narrator&#39;s youth. You as the reader, get to kind of just chill and vibe with the author for some days at the end of summer in Japan. And while this book wasn&#39;t necessarily a life-changing book, it captures a powerful moment in time for the author, and is a reflection of that period of transition into adulthood we all go through. There is a constant sense of ....goodbye?... I am not really sure how to explain that feeling much better.</p> <p>It is difficult to put a finger on a focused central theme of the book. But for me, the concept of loneliness is what really impacted me the most

An example is <em>East of Eden</em> by John Steinbeck. Which at one point discusses the difference about God ordering people to rule over sin versus promising them that they will triumph over sin. But that the most accurate understanding is that they &quot;may&quot; rule over sin, which suggests there is a choice, that despite one&#39;s weakness and limitations we have a choice in life. At least that&#39;s how I remember that discussion.</p> <p>On the surface this talk of choice may sound obvious to you, and it&#39;s certainly nothing new or groundbreaking.
