<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! So I’ve decided to challenge myself to listen to an album I’ve never heard before every day of 2025, to expand my taste a bit. So far I’ve listened to:</p> <p>1/1/2025: Björk - Vespertine (8/10)</p> <p>2/1/2025: American Football - American Football (9/10)</p> <p>3/1/2025: Title Fight - Shed (8/10)</p> <pre><code> - (Bonus) Title Fight - Floral Green (7/10) </code></pre> <p>4/1/2025: Biffy Clyro - Puzzle (7/10)</p> <p>5/1/2025: N/A due to busy day lol</p> <p>Do you guys have any suggestions for further albums? I’ll honestly listen to anything as long as it’s not overproduced garbage pop music or like country or something. Although if you want more specifics my favourite bands at the moment are: black midi, Radiohead, Coldplay (pre 2011), Geordie Greep, Fontaines D.C, Wunderhorse and I have also really enjoyed the albums I’ve listened to so far such as title fight and American football. Thank you! </p> <p>Edit: I’m also looking to get into e

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Something that I’ve noticed recently, particularly in my own scene back in the northeast is that a lot of bands that could be described as industrial purposefully distanced themselves from the title and while this is simply an anecdote there’s a couple of bands that I know of in my local scene back home personally that straight up describe the term as “too Goth.” That’s not to say that there aren’t some bands that purposefully describe themselves as industrial or at the very least don’t have any disdain for the distinction (bands like Aurat and Choke Chain to name some).</p> <p>But why is it that for every modern electronic band that’s willing to call themselves or be labeled by their fan base “industrial” there’s seemingly at least one other that would rather be associated with the hardcore punk or noise scenes even if there music is more fittingly fitted within the tradition of Ministry and Nitzer Ebb than that of say Flipper.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, everyone!</p> <p>I’ve always been intrigued by something that happens at the end of Michael Jackson’s song <em>The Way You Make Me Feel</em>. At <strong>4:50</strong>, during the fade-out, you can hear <strong>three distinct beeps</strong>.</p> <p>This issue seems to be present in all versions of the song, even in the most recent remasters. Could it be an artistic effect, an intentional message, or something technical that happened during the recording?</p> <p>This mystery has been on my mind for years, and I’d love to hear any information or theories you might have!
