Literally one scene where Smith and Lawrence lay into him. He has no bearing on the plot, no arc, nothing. He&#39;s just a joke. They could&#39;ve cut the scene and it wouldn&#39;t have taken much from the movie beyond a bit of length (it&#39;s 2.5 hours.) Bringing him back in Bad Boys For Life to marry Lawrence&#39;s daughter was a fun nod back to II given that 18 years had passed. It&#39;s a simple, easy callback, and I was happy they got that actor to come back for one scene. </p> <p>Then in Ride or Die, he gets a full on action scene that is one of the most fun, well-choreographed John Wick-esque sequences in the movie. But that&#39;s it. He doesn&#39;t join them in the final showdown, he&#39;s not brought into any other action. It&#39;s literally just an action showcase, and an epic payoff for anyone who&#39;s wa",
