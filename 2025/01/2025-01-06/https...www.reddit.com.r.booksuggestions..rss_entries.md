Can anyone recommend a good book that’s wholesome, sweet, filled with morals, respect, and will give my soul a peaceful place in heaven?</p> <p>For the first time in my 29 boring years of life, I decided to read a dark romance book—Beautiful Fiend by Lola King—thanks to TikTok..... and Sweet Baby Jesus, this book is DARK DARK, like the outer space. I seriously want to laundry my eyes and brain and dry them in the sun. It made me want to use holy water as moisturizer. I couldn’t finish it. I was so disgusted I thought I&#39;m gonna have a cardiac arrest. My fragile heart and soul can’t handle it. Dark romance is NOT for me. 😞</p> <p>So please, I need a book that has a wholesome plot and characters. No Rape, Sexual Assault or any Boombayah scenes with no consent. No to toxic Male MC or cheating. I want to fall in love with the Male MC because he&#39;s so perfect. So perfect that it will raise m

Okay, maybe a little midlife crisis-ish, but a bit existential. </p> <p>Anyway, not sure exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but a book involving the passage of time maybe?

She loves Jane Austen and has read every single one of her books, and for the past few years has almost exclusively read fanfictions based off Jane Austen novels. </p> <p>I’m personally interested in very different genres than my mother, so I’m not really sure where to find something that would fit her taste.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! so it’s my partners birthday on the first of Feb and he mentioned the other day he’d like to read more. He just knows he has a short attention span when it comes to reading so a book has to be REALLY good for him to keep with it. He enjoys the film producer robert Eggers (bloke who did ‘the lighthouse’ and most recently ‘nosferatu’). I was thinking of getting him THE og Dracula but I know he will have a hard time with the older style of writing. So if anyone has any good short story suggestions that would be great!!

## Books for a One Piece fan with no attention span

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I’m trying to get back into reading and I’d love some recommendations for books similar to the anime One Piece. It doesn’t have to be about pirates, but I think I’d like to stick to fantasy or adventure as a genre</p> <p>What I like about One Piece is the strong bonds between the characters, the little moments of downtime they get between fights, and the way you feel immersed in their lives, their routines and their relationships. I would also like something with the same themes of hope &amp; courage, I like that they’re all trying to pursue their dreams. My favourite character is Sanji, if that helps too</p> <p>The thing is, I have ADHD and struggle to stick with books for longer than a couple chapters, so it needs to really grab my attention. I need something with lovable characters, good humour, or something unique and whimsical. It would probably also help if the writing isn’t too dense, but I don’t mind if it’s a longer book or series </p> <

## Looking for books set in the Renaissance or Victorian era!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So like the title said I&#39;m looking for something set in the Renaissance or Victorian era. I want to dive into a world of Lords and Ladies, forbidden love, and beautiful melancholy. It would be great if the story has a gothic feel to it, I want to read something deeply tragic and equally as beautiful. It can even be a fantasy! The only rule is I&#39;d like the book to be fiction. Thank you &lt;3 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rubi_Wolf1988"> /u/Rubi_Wolf1988 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1humg10/looking_for_books_set_in_the_renaissance_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1humg10/looking_for_books_set_in_the_renaissance_or/">[comments]</a></span>

## Books about empathy, co-dependence, and strengthening interpersonal relationships

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I’m struggling with my interpersonal relationships recently. I’ve developed a form of hyper-independence as a result of trauma, my need to work hard and take on responsibilities often leads me to attracting people who become dependent on me. While I love these people and I want to keep them in my life, I feel consistently overwhelmed and like there is no one in my life I can rely on for help when I need it. Especially when so many people in my life are struggling even worse than I am. This distress has been exacerbated by the generally shitty state of the world. I’m struggling to make and maintain meaningful connections and many of my needs are not being met by my current relationships. Can anyone recommend some books that may help me work through some of these problems? Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/meet-me-in-the-mud"> /u/meet-me-in-the-mud </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht
