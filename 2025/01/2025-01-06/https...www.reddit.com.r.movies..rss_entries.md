## The Reggie payoff in Bad Boys: Ride or Die is quite possibly the best use of a side character in a lega-sequel I've ever seen. Are there any other examples of this?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, Reggie was in one scene in Bad Boys II from 2002. He&#39;s a 15-year-old taking Martin Lawrence&#39;s daughter on a date. Literally one scene where Smith and Lawrence lay into him. He has no bearing on the plot, no arc, nothing. He&#39;s just a joke. They could&#39;ve cut the scene and it wouldn&#39;t have taken much from the movie beyond a bit of length (it&#39;s 2.5 hours.) Bringing him back in Bad Boys For Life to marry Lawrence&#39;s daughter was a fun nod back to II given that 18 years had passed. It&#39;s a simple, easy callback, and I was happy they got that actor to come back for one scene. </p> <p>Then in Ride or Die, he gets a full on action scene that is one of the most fun, well-choreographed John Wick-esque sequences in the movie. But that&#39;s it. He doesn&#39;t join them in the final showdown, he&#39;s not brought into any other action. It&#39;s literally just an action showcase, and an epic payoff for anyone who&#39;s wa

## The movie FLOW is wonderful. Does anyone have theories about what the hell is going on?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The incredible movie Flow, out now, follows the journey of a cat who must bond with unlikely allies to escape a terrifyingly destructive flood.</p> <p>All of the animals in the movie act almost completely as real animals would in the various situations they find themselves; there’s very little anthropomorphism, beyond the use of some simple tools. And even that doesn’t come close to some of the wild feats of intelligence I’ve seen untrained animals perform on YouTube. </p> <p>Very quickly, the movie reveals itself to take place in a fantasy world, the lore and rules of which are never explained. We see massive sculptures and bizarre land formations unlike anything on earth, but conspicuous by their absence is humanity. All around the animal characters, the residual pieces of some kind of magical society Are left empty to sink beneath the ever rising tide.</p> <p>Eventually, we see an actual wild sequence of supernatural magic, and what appears to be

## What made Die Hard (1988) so good in my opinion

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Context:</p> <p>I was in my mid-teens when I saw Die Hard, for the first time, in the theaters. A natural film-lover, I was still pretty young and naive when it came to how movies go and could fall completely into the moment of films without cynically &quot;knowing&quot; how films work to create the audience experience. Nevertheless, I was a pretty astute kid and could spot bullshit a lot of the time when I saw it.</p> <p>Seeing Die Hard in the theater was probably the first time I had ever wondered if the protagonist in an action film might not make it out alive. I&#39;d seen Star Wars, Raiders, Terminator, etc. And while all of those other films were thrilling, I never had the sense that the main good guy would fail/die. It didn&#39;t really matter because they were still fun to watch. But it wasn&#39;t until Die Hard that I actually wasn&#39;t able to assume John McClane was just going to make it no matter what.</p> <p>Specifically, the scene wher

## Bryan Johnson's, Don’t Die: A Profound Reminder That Immortality Means Nothing Without Love and Connection

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching <em>Don’t Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever</em> on Netflix, and while it was fascinating to see Bryan Johnson’s intense pursuit of longevity, the documentary left me reflecting on something much deeper than supplements, biohacking, or even the quest to defy aging.</p> <p>At its core, the film felt less about living forever and more about what truly makes life meaningful: relationships and human connection. Bryan’s relationship with his son, Talmage, was the emotional backbone of the story. Seeing their journey together, from Talmage moving in with Bryan to eventually graduating and heading off to college, added a layer of humanity to what could’ve easily been just a sterile exploration of cutting-edge science.</p> <p>There’s a particularly moving scene in a department store where Bryan is crying with his son. When asked about it, he reflects on something that feels universally true: “Humans thrive in community and posit
