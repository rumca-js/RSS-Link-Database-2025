President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to pardon “many” participants who have been charged in the Jan. 6 riot. Of the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants, all have been charged with some form of trespassing or disorderly conduct and more than a third have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Some, like Joseph Biggs, a leader of the Proud Boys, are already lobbying for pardons. 

WSJ spoke to experts and those involved in the day on what it would take for Trump to follow through on that promise.
