The Penguin is one of the most famous villains in Batman's Rogues Gallery.  He's been portrayed both in live action and animation several times over Batman's run in Hollywood.  When Colin Ferrell was announced as The Penguin in Matt Reeve's The Batman, many fans were unsure if the Hollywood star would be able to carry the character famously played by Danny DeVito last.   But after The Batman was released and the subsequent HBO Series Penguin, Colin Ferrell once again proved why he's one of the best actors in Hollywood.
