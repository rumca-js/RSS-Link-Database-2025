<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Froggy folk! I&#39;m back to bring up some updates to the development of our game, Frogmageddon. Frogmageddon is a bullet heaven survival game in which you fight the hordes of enemies with your own horde. Each frog you spawn (or discover) grants a set of new weapons/abilities to fight the snake menace!</p> <p>Since posting about this a few months back, we premiered an updated version at the Boston Festival of Indie Games (BFIG) with some new features: * Nearly a dozen new frog types, some only found throughout the map. * New harder difficulty mode with new enemy types * UI overhaul including a game mode view and glossary * Steam Deck compatibility</p> <p>We&#39;ve been hard at work to make the Steam version of Frogmageddon as frog-filling as we can. We would love it if you checked out our Steam page or other links found below. Also, if you happen to have checked out our game at BFIG, we&#39;d love to hear what you thought in the comments!</p> <
