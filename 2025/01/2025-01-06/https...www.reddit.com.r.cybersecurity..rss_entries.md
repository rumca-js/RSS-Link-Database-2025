Might be a good idea to check your emails for possibly being signed up for one of their trial periods that end in you getting charged for $83. Then when I asked for a refund over the phone they literally haggled over it, first trying to only give me $25, then only $50 and only after my insistence did they agree to a full refund within three days to a week. Three days to a week. I told him I need an instant refund and got stonewalled at that point.

The intersection of these two fields feels right—data science provides the tools to uncover patterns and insights that traditional methods might miss, and in a field like infosec, where threats are constantly evolving, feeds valuable results.</p> <p>Our research explores how data-driven approaches can better identify vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and predict potential threats before they escalate. We think this work offers a fresh perspective and could provide actionable takeaways for professionals in both data science and cybersecurity.</p> <p>We’re now looking for opportunities to share this work and are seeking conferences—regional or national—with open calls for papers (CFPs). Have any suggestions? We’ve missed a few key deadlines but believe this research will still be highly relevant heading into mid/late 2025.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Insider cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to organizations, but these can be effectively managed through a combination of policies, technologies, and employee education through a combination of technical measures, organizational policies, and employee education. A comprehensive approach can be:</p> <p>1. <strong>Set a Security Policy:</strong> Develop a policy outlining procedures to detect and prevent insider misuse, with guidelines for investigation and consequences for violations.</p> <p>2. <strong>Secure Your Infrastructure:</strong> Limit access to sensitive data with strict access controls and apply least privilege and identity verification methods, such as biometric authentication, to reduce insider risks.</p> <p>3. <strong>Strong Authentication Measures</strong>: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and complex, unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised.</p> <p>4. <strong>Data Class

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I am currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity and I am looking for a unique final year project idea. The challenge is that i have to build a functional tool or plugin that hasn’t been done before or find a research gap and implement it. Most of the ideas I’ve come across online or through other resources have already been implemented leaving me a bit stuck. I was thinking about building a self healing cyber defence system that autonomously repairs vulnerabilities and restores normalcy after cyberattacks but that too exists.</p> <p>i was wondering if anyone online would know a gap in this topic or has any suggestions, I’d greatly appreciate your input.
