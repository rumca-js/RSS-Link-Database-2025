The long -standing base, Port Bouet, is to be rid of its French troop occupants and is to be renamed General Quattara Thomas d'Aquinn base after an indigenous military figure. No one knows whether the French were pushed or are voluntarily fleeing. The latter possibility makes more sense in the context of recent developments in relations between Paris and its many West African client states.",
