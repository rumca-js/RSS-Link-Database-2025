<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I am a professional software designer and make what would be considered good money three four years ago however now in this economy it is not really enough for me to feel safe anymore. Does anyone have any experience taking 1 off small free lance request or other less skilled tech related jobs on the side to supplement thier primary developer salary?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sipCoding_smokeMath"> /u/sipCoding_smokeMath </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hus262/second_jobs_youve_done_to_supplement_your_coding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1hus262/second_jobs_youve_done_to_supplement_your_coding/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im a junior dev and I decided to write a simple python script for creating a simple audio and video merger script, I noticed the copilot icon before in vs code but never actually tried it. </p> <p>So I did and, omg, it makes the process so much faster, you want a list of all the vlc supported extentions : here you go, you want a function that returns the 2 most recent files with the given extentions? (ok, it did give it to me in the most cramed way but uncraming it took way less time than actually writing the thing myself.) I was confused on how the use a reverse sort using lambda x of the files download time as the key worked and it just explained it to me.</p> <p>So like, verifying and cleaning it a bit makes creating functions of code and constant very fast.</p> <p>But it feels a bit weird, like, are there things I should be looking out for, are there drawbacks? Do some job not want you to use it for some reason? anything I should know about it? c
