While visiting The Current studio to play songs from their debut album, "One Of A Kind," and to talk with Jill Riley, The Heavy Heavy's Will Turner and Georgie Fuller stuck around to take a fun quiz in The Current studio — riffing on their band name, all quiz answers contain words that repeat. Will and Georgie took it all in stride with great humor — watch how they did in the video above. 

The Heavy Heavy's album "One Of A Kind" is available on @atorecords.
