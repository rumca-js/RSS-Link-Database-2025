There are literally hundreds of startups trying to tackle the doctor burnout and info siloing problems! What makes it extra rough is they don\u2019t seem to distinguish themselves from each other, None of them do a great job of actually providing concrete examples of their offering and instead list vague benefits and want you to schedule a demo. So are they mostly all just wrappers? \u201cProprietary LLM\u201d actually scares me because they\u2019ll never compete with the big 3. It\u2019s so overwhelming trying to sift through that in inclined to just fine tune our own model.
