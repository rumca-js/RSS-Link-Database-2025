And I couldn&#39;t help but try a VR porn. It‚Äôs crazy how you believe it üòÖ On the other hand, I noticed that the ‚Äúactors‚Äù are never really centered. In fact, I have to turn my head slightly to the right all the time...as if the video was not completely centered. Is there any way to correct this? I stream directly through the browser.

## Looking for advice from connoisseurs of VR flight games and simulators?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are 2 areas I am looking into. The first being simulating all the actions you would need to perform to actually fly commercial aircrafts. I have no intention of enrolling in flight school or flying an actual plane. I just enjoy the theory behind it and would like to know all the correct terminology and mechanics. From what I have found so far, Aerofly FS4 and MS Flight Simulator 2024 are the best 2 candidates for this. </p> <p>The second is fun dogfights. When it comes to combat, I would rather the games just be arcade-like or simplistic. Having uncomplicated and unrealistic controls for flying and attacking (Basically you can use the controllers to do everything without needing to look inside the plane for something to press/toggle). From all the videos I&#39;ve watched, the games range erratically different in this area. These can be from any time period, but games with progression such as a campaign or challanges would be preferable.</p> <p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I bought a Meta Quest 3 and I&#39;m having a great time with it. I seen how easy it is to record your gameplay and decided to do some posts on Youtube for a little fun. I don&#39;t expect to get millions of views lol but I would enjoy building a small community. What games are really fun and you recommend I make some videos with? Right now my videos are just small clips of gameplay and if you wanted to check some out and maybe leave a comment on some tips there as well would be awesome! Thanks! :)</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SMEADGAMING">SMEAD GAMING - YouTube</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OppositeWolverine848"> /u/OppositeWolverine848 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hulsmp/new_to_vr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hulsmp/new_to_vr/">[comments]</a></span>
