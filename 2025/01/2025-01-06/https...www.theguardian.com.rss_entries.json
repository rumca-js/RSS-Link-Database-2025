It\u2019s 1997, and in the backseat of a car the Chinese consul\u2019s daughter Soo-yung (played by an 11-year-old Julia Hsu) belts sweet fantasy in the only way a Mariah song can be belted, her stone-faced bodyguards in front wading through Los Angeles traffic. To 10-year-old me, who sang about heartbreak and desire with similar vigor in front of her immigrant parents, it was a quintessentially American moment. There\u2019s pure joy in Soo-yung\u2019s face before we cut to the scene at large, as the car is directed to the side. A police car swings in front of them and a man gets out, unflinchingly shoots the bodyguards and abducts Soo-yung.</p><p>And thus the crux of the plot in this 1998 action comedy is set in motion.

It\u2019s an interesting question given that George Clooney is still hovering elegantly in the A-list sphere almost three decades after Batman &amp; Robin turned the Caped Crusader into a neon-lit fashion faux pas. Clooney, who once apologised for the film as if it were an embarrassing yearbook photo, went on to redefine himself as a Hollywood powerhouse, proving that even the worst bat-nippled blunders can\u2019t keep a true star down. Halle Berry, who headlined the worst Catwoman movie in history, still turns up every now and again on Netflix. Ryan Reynolds has made light of insipid early turns in 2011\u2019s Green Lantern (and indeed as a mostly mute Deadpool in the rubbish 2009 ensemble effort X-Men Origins: Wolverine) with three well-",

Real Madrid\u2019s now-public courtship may have had something to do with it, but at times it felt he was being hung out to dry. Poorly as he played, he was deliberately exposed by his own team, left to deal with whatever threats Manchester United could conjure down their left flank while the only players likely to drop back and help him out, Mohamed Salah and Ryan Gravenberch, rarely did so. When it became obvious that he was having an off day, nothing was done to cover for it and nurse him back into the game. When his own poor clearance was returned in the buildup to United\u2019s opening goal it found him briefly with four opponents to deal with by himself, demonstrating that Liverpool\u2019s problems down the right were not just an individual but a systemic issue.

The friend remarked on the great difference there was between the woman he knew and the star the world thought it knew. \u201cYou want me to be her?\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cWatch.\u201d She whipped off the scarf, opened the raincoat, thrust out her chest and put on The Walk.

In each box, write a few words about what you want to contribute. Then rate each out of 10 in terms of how important it is to you, and rate it again out of 10, based on how much you feel you\u2019re living in line with that. Those scores give an indication of where you might have been taken away from something that matters to you. For example, your relationship may be 10 out of 10 important, but it\u2019s a 2 out of 10 in terms of how much you\u2019re showing up recently. This isn\u2019t a tool for self-criticism, because it\u2019s normal that life pulls us in different directions, but it gives you clarity.
