Okay, maybe a little midlife crisis-ish, but a bit existential. </p> <p>Anyway, not sure exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but a book involving the passage of time maybe?

It was what i hoped for. By no means a perfect book, but one i liked dearly. </p> <p>Now, based on everything i read in regards to the sequel, the opinions are mixe, in a way. I Struggle to find many down the middle, balanced reviews. Most of them are quite polarised in either loving the book mindlessly or hating the book fiercly. The author is being accused of using the book to transmit an exagerated political message in regards to LGBTQ or equality in general, and while i love books that stand for something, having it &quot;mansplained&quot; to me by 8 years old in constant manner would be a big turn off. I&#39;d love some feedback from you guys in regards to this book. Is it as bad as people say?

I would also like something with the same themes of hope &amp; courage, I like that they\u2019re all trying to pursue their dreams. My favourite character is Sanji, if that helps too</p> <p>The thing is, I have ADHD and struggle to stick with books for longer than a couple chapters, so it needs to really grab my attention. I need something with lovable characters, good humour, or something unique and whimsical. It would probably also help if the writing isn\u2019t too dense, but I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s a longer book or series </p> <",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So like the title said I&#39;m looking for something set in the Renaissance or Victorian era. I want to dive into a world of Lords and Ladies, forbidden love, and beautiful melancholy. It would be great if the story has a gothic feel to it, I want to read something deeply tragic and equally as beautiful. It can even be a fantasy! The only rule is I&#39;d like the book to be fiction. Thank you &lt;3 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rubi_Wolf1988\"> /u/Rubi_Wolf1988 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1humg10/looking_for_books_set_in_the_renaissance_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1humg10/looking_for_books_set_in_the_renaissance_or/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone. I\u2019m struggling with my interpersonal relationships recently. I\u2019ve developed a form of hyper-independence as a result of trauma, my need to work hard and take on responsibilities often leads me to attracting people who become dependent on me. While I love these people and I want to keep them in my life, I feel consistently overwhelmed and like there is no one in my life I can rely on for help when I need it. Especially when so many people in my life are struggling even worse than I am. This distress has been exacerbated by the generally shitty state of the world. I\u2019m struggling to make and maintain meaningful connections and many of my needs are not being met by my current relationships. Can anyone recommend some books that may help me work through some of these problems? Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/meet-me-in-the-mud\"> /u/meet-me-in-the-mud </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",
