Schluter shower curb tips…I use KERDI-FIX as an adhesive in the corners. Then I apply ALL-SET to the wall and curb with the KERDI trowel. I embed the prefab corner into both materials. This combo keeps the corner waterproof and flat, which helps tremendously with my tile work. Many thanks to @schlutersystems1  for providing materials for my client’s custom shower👍🏽🔥#showerdesign #schlutersystems #customshower #getitdone
