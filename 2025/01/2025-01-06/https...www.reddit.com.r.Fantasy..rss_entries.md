I&#39;d love some recommendations, as I often struggle to find YA fantasy that works for me because so much of it seems to be oversaturated by enemies-to-lovers, assassins-who-aren&#39;t-really-assassins stories. (I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t the case and there&#39;s lots out there, but I&#39;ve been out of the YA loop for a while!)</p> <p>Some YA fantasies/horrors I&#39;ve enjoyed:</p> <ul> <li>The Invocations by Krystal Sutherland</li> <li>The Raven Boys by Maggie Stiefvater (Currently reading this series and loving it)</li> <li>The Cruel Prince by Holly Black (I wasn&#39;t expecting to enjoy this series and ended up loving it, so I&#39;m open to being surprised!)</li> <li>The Diviners by Libba Bray</li> <li>Dread Nation by Justina Ireland</li> <li>Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo</li> <li>Seraphina by Rachel Hartman</li> <li>Strange the Dr

It featured a plethora of movie merchandise, the original Wizard of Oz by Baum, and the Maguire novels.

Maybe. I checked the shelves and it seems that all the Wicked books were only on the display, so no copies of Lion Among Men anywhere in the store. To be sold out of that particular book when they still have so many of the others would be odd, but not impossible. Maybe it got missed on the last order, or the order went unfulfilled.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Dragonbone Chair is almost two books in one. On one hand, its a simple quest where a young castle dogsbody, is plucked from obscurity to fulfil his destiny by an enigmatic mentor. On the other, it is a fantastic political intrigue, with various factions vying for the throne, with princes searching for their allies, brutal betrayals and a mystical force that threatens the whole kingdom.</p> <p>Both halves are excellent. The quest is elevated above others because the protagonist, Simon, is such a realistic teenager. He moans relentlessly about the hardships he has to endure and almost dies on multiple occasions due to having no idea how to survive in the wilderness on his own. Only through the intervention of some of the excellent side characters does he get anywhere at all. The world itself contains some of my favourite character moments in any book. In particular, the friendship between Strangyeard and Jarnauga was a highlight. The Sithi, this bo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello peeps,</p> <p>- Cassandra Clare: In my teens I used to be a big fan of hers and even now I try to read every book that she releases even though the plots just have not been it for me. Her writing style is up my alley even though sometimes it gets too slow and boring.</p> <p>- Sarah J Mass: 5ish years ago I met a friend who forced me into reading ACOTAR and we know how that goes. I loved the series, ate it all up. Then continued on with her Throne of Glass series (which does not compare to ACOTAR, I just enjoyed ACOTAR too much; it was a nice read and I enjoyed it - Manon and Lorcan will probably forever be some of my favorites ever to live) then continued on with the Crescent City series and although it was a fun read, it was okay for me. Short story, I&#39;ve enjoyed all of SJM&#39;s books; her plots, writing style, character, and world building are just top tier.</p> <p>- Fourth Wing: Fast forward and everyone kept talking about it last year.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of my favorite fantasy books as a child was Voyage of the Dawntreader. The adventures and the sense of discovery were fantastic.

So I wasn’t sure I would enjoy it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/locutus49"> /u/locutus49 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hun07w/fantasy_books_that_involve_voyages_on_ships/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hun07w/fantasy_books_that_involve_voyages_on_ships/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was always way into the fantasy genre but I&#39;ve never had the mental focus to read LOTR, for example. Absolutely adore the films, but my ability to focus on reading had already dwindled by the time I wanted to try reading the series. I was absolutely obsessed with Harry Potter and Eragon growing up tho, and those I read multiple times. </p> <p>So after so many years of barely getting through a couple of fiction books, I picked up A court of thorns and roses since I&#39;ve seen it recommended so very much by people whose opinions I generally agree with... And man, I feel like I&#39;m back in high school reading Twilight or fantasy shoujo manga. I enjoyed the idea of the world and I liked the story up to when <span class="md-spoiler-text">Fayre gets taken to Prythian, but after that it just got baaad.....
