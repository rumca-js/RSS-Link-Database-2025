This cute yellow rolling device has a built-in projector that allows it to beam images and videos on your walls and floors, so you can interact with it. No further information on pricing and a more specific window of time has been shared, though.</p>
<p>When it was first announced, Samsung <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/08/samsung-ballie-home-robot-projector/">told <em>The Washington Post</em></a> that Ballie would actually be available at some point in 2024.

The main takeaway is that the conversations you have with the Google Assistant will feel more natural. Personally, I'd appreciate being able to ask questions as they pop in my head, without having to formulate some Assistant-friendly sentence before speaking — what I saw makes me feel like my wish could come true.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To kick things off, you'll still say "Hey Google," but for follow-up questions you can skip the prompt and the Assistant will be able to hold on to the thread of your conversation. During the demonstration, held in a simulated (and very posh) kitchen, the Google representative asked things like what to

While that’s due in part to the unwritten rule that every new gadget must have AI stuffed inside, it’s also practically due to Intel’s Core Ultra 5 and 7 chips being built precisely for that purpose, with three compute engines for on-device AI tasks.

<p>This year at CES 2025, Dell is announcing a huge rebranding for all of its consumer and commercial PCs. However, while this change is generally a move in the right direction, I think getting rid of the iconic XPS name is an unforced error.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, Dell’s new unified branding will see its laptops, desktops and other devices divided into three main families. Standard Dell machines are aimed at general consumers and designed for school, work and casual gaming. (Alienware gaming PCs are also getting updated names, but they will remain separate from Dell’s core computing products.) Then there are Dell Pro devices, which are primarily for businesses and meant to support pro-grade productivity. Finally, there is the Dell Pro Max line, which as its name suggests comprises systems built to deliver maximum performance (i.e. workstations).</p>

You can pretty much guess what it delivers: More power, and potentially more battery life. AMD also confirmed a rumor that&#39;s been floating around for months: Valve also plans to put the Ryzen Z2 in an upcoming Steam Deck revision. Valve hasn&#39;t responded to our request for comment yet, but given that the original Steam Deck was powered by a custom AMD chip, it makes sense that it would eventually be upgraded with AMD&#39;s latest hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading the charge for the Ryzen Z2 family is the Z2 Extreme, featuring eight cores, a 5GHz max clock speed and 16 RDNA 3 graphics cores. The least powerful model is the Z2 Go with four CPU cores and 12 graphics cores. That could be a useful chip for cheaper handhelds, especially those that tout game st

<p>So long XPS, au revoir Inspiron, later, Latitude. Dell is officially giving its existing PC brands the boot at CES 2025 and moving to terms that normal people will actually understand: Dell, Dell Pro and Dell Pro Max. Seems self-explanatory, no? Dell systems are purely consumer plays, while the Dell Pro line focuses on business users. Dell Pro Max, naturally, are super-powered workstations meant for the most demanding users.</p>
<p>The rebranding makes a certain amount of sense. Why should consumers have to learn about the difference between Latitude and Inspiron laptops? But it&#39;s also disappointing news for fans of the company&#39;s XPS lineup, as that&#39;s now officially dead. Going with &quot;Pro&quot; and &quot;Pro Max&quot; terms also evokes Apple&#39;s hardware more than anything from the land of Dell, so it&#39;s not exactly coming from a position of strength.</p>

## The Acer Nitro Blaze 11 is an absolutely massive handheld gaming PC

<p>Acer is a little late when it comes to releasing its first handheld gaming PC. But now at CES 2025, it seems like the company is trying to make up for lost time by going big. Really big. That’s because later this year, it’s planning to release a gigantic offering in the Nitro Blaze 11.</p>
<p>Packing detachable controllers and a built-in kickstand, the Blaze 11 shares a number of similarities with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-go-review-the-xl-alternative-to-the-steam-deck-141522230.html"><ins>Lenovo’s Legion Go</ins></a>. However, when all that is attached to an 11-inch 2,560 x 1,600 IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of brightness, the result is something that feels very different. In some ways, it’s almost like holding a steering wheel with a tablet-sized screen slammed in the middle along with your typical assortment of joysticks, face buttons and shoulder triggers on either side.</p>

## AMD previews RDNA 4 graphics with AI upscaling, teases RX 9070 GPUs

<p>While all eyes are on NVIDIA for its RTX 5000 GPUs at CES 2025, AMD is also taking the opportunity to give us a glimpse at its upcoming RDNA 4 graphics architecture. While specifics are scarce, the company says its new GPUs will be built on a 4nm process with &quot;optimized&quot; compute units, &quot;supercharged&quot; AI computation and better ray tracing per compute unit. The big reveal, though, is that its new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR4) will be powered by machine learning, just like NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology. AMD claims FSR 4 will offer &quot;high quality&quot; 4K upscaling, frame generation and low latency support with AMD Anti-Lag 2.</p>

<p>Hisense just introduced its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/newsroom/hisense-marks-new-era-of-display-innovation-with-its-first-consumer-microled-at-ces-2025">first consumer microLED television</a> at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. The 136MX includes a high-density array of over 24.88 microscopic LEDs to “deliver unparalleled brightness, resolution, and precision.” As with all microLED displays, each pixel is its own light source. This allows for a near-infinite dynamic contrast ratio, with fantastic brightness and deep blacks. It&#39;s also a big ole beast, at 136 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TV is powered by the company’s proprietary Hi-View AI Engine X chipset, which uses AI algorithms for frame optimization. This should allow for ultra-precise color conversion and improved clarity even in well-lit spaces. To that end, the brightness levels here reach up to 10,000 nits, with a 95 percent color gamut.</p>

The new NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet is built around the (also new) NXTPAPER 4.0 screen, which uses "nano-matrix lithography” to improve clarity and sharpness. Color accuracy has improved too, with the new output measuring just one on the Delta-E scale (the metric measures how the human eye perceives color differences and any value of one or lower is said to be imperceptible to the human eye).</p> 
<p>Since 2021, TCL has been trying to craft a screen that’s easier on the eyes with its NXTPAPER tech, and now it’s throwing AI into the mix (perhaps unsurprisingly). The new AI-pow

<p>Audio brand JLab has unveiled its first headphones with adaptive active noise cancellation at CES 2025. The company&#39;s Epic Lux Lab Edition Wireless Headphones will cost $199. Pre-orders begin today and shipments are expected to go out starting January 30.</p>
<p>The Epic Lux Lab is an over-ear headphone set with 32mm high-fidelity custom dynamic drivers. The set&#39;s adaptive ANC can react in real-time to changes in ambient noise levels. Its noise cancelling mode can diminish environmental audio up to 42 dB, while the Be Aware mode allows outside sounds to reach the user. Both modes can be customized with the JLab app.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The headphones come with a magnetic wireless charging pad and also have a built-in USB-C port for wired charging. JLab says the Epic Lux Lab can deliver &quot;over 90+ hours of playtime on a single charge,&quot; or 60 hours when active noise cancelling is in use.</p>

<p>With the increasing popularity of 4K and even 8K displays, today at CES 2025 the HDMI Forum officially revealed version 2.2 of the HDMI spec.</p>
<p>While the shape of the connector and its general capabilities aren’t changing a ton, the big upgrade for HDMI 2.2 is that it can now support bandwidths of up to 96Gbps. This should make it significantly easier to send content with higher refresh rates and resolutions to compatible displays to help ensure your content looks as good as possible.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, alongside the increased bandwidth, the HDMI Forum is also rolling out new Ultra96 HDMI branded cables that will be part of the organization&#39;s certification process to help customers better identify when they are buying a compatible HDMI cord. The forum says testing will be required for each model length and instructed to display an official Certification Label on the cable itself.</p>

<p>Swimming is one of my favorite things in the whole world. Cleaning a pool, however, is an absolute drag. For my money, pool-cleaning robots are much handier than even standard robovacs. If you have access to a pool, the forthcoming Wybot S3 could ensure you never have to walk around like a doofus with an oversized net ever again.</p> 
<p>Announced at CES, the Wybot S3 is an improvement over the S2 in nearly every way. The company says it’s the “first self-docking, self-emptying automatic charging pool cleaning robot.” It includes an automated self-emptying system, which is standard with land-based robovacs but new to water-adjacent models. The unit transfers debris from its body to a 10-liter above ground base station. This bin is big enough to go 30 days without having to be manually emptied.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Every year at CES, Stern Pinball has a new game to show off. They're one of the oldest and most well-known pinball manufacturers (not to mention one of the few left standing in 2025) so it's always fun for me, a pinball nerd, to check out what they have to show off. This year, it's a new machine meant to celebrate 50 years of Dungeons &amp; Dragons called <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant's Eye</em>. And like many pinball games, you can just walk up and play without knowing the intricacies of the game, but there's a lot here to uncover over time.</p>
<p>The thing that caught my eye was the fact that you can pick a character and level them up over time, provided you use Stern's Insider Connected app. That app already lets you create a profile and keep track of achievements, games in your area, your top scores and other features (you "log in" by scanning a QR code from the app). But with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, you can actually improve your character over time and save

<p>This is not a phone. The Comet by Mecha Systems is a modular, Linux-based handheld computer built for hobbyists, engineers, students, artists and roboticists of all kinds. The Comet is a chunky palm-sized device, and it has a 1.8 GHz ARM64 Quad-core processor, 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of on-board storage, though this space is expandable. Most of the Comet&#39;s features are customizable, in fact.</p>
<p>The Comet&#39;s magnetic snap interface allows users to clip on a variety of control panels, called extensions, transforming the handheld into whatever device you need. For now, Mecha offers three standard extensions: a gamepad with a soft-press D-pad and four input buttons, a GPIO panel with access to 40 pins, and a keyboard with ABS keys.</p>

Amongst the earbuds and speakers, the company is debuting a set of premium over-ear headphones with an interesting feature. The Tour One M3 headphones will ship with what JBL calls the Smart Tx audio transmitter.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This wireless device allows the Bluetooth headphones to play audio from sources like inflight entertainment systems and analog wired connections. Plus, the Smart Tx has touchscreen controls, offering access to playback and volume adjustments as well as EQ settings and Auracast.

<p>The $799 device is made for infants in the first few months of their lives. Elvie says the bouncer works for babies up to 20 lbs or 6 months old, while the bassinet is meant for babies up to 5 months or 22 lbs.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Samsung is kicking off 2025 with a lineup of new AI-enhanced televisions. At CES 2025, Samsung unveiled the Neo QLED 8K QN990F and QN900F, plus the Neo QLED 4K QN90F, QN80F and QN70F. The TVs come with glare-free technology and a suite of AI features driven by Samsung Vision AI.</p>
<p>The Neo QLED 8K QN990F is Samsung’s top-of-the-line model and it features a super-slim, minimalist footprint and an NQ8 AI Gen3 Processor. Its AI abilities include proprietary 8K upscaling, frame-by-frame HDR remastering, adaptive sound, color boosting and AI Mode, which automatically optimizes picture and sound based on the content on screen. These represent updates to existing Samsung AI efforts.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In line with the minimalist aesthetic, Samsung is also shipping a Wireless One Connect Box for the QN990F, allowing users to keep their TV space wire-free.

<p>Samsung has new soundbars and updates to an existing model to show off at CES 2025. First, the HW-QS700F is an all-new speaker that&#39;s designed to sit on a shelf or TV stand, but it can also be mounted at 90 degrees flat on a wall under a TV. The QS700F can optimize the sound based on how you&#39;ve situated it for the best performance. It will come with a wireless subwoofer, but it&#39;s unclear if rear satellite speakers are part of the package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company&#39;s flagship soundbar returns for 2025 with a significant tweak. The HW-Q990F will remain an all-in-one package with wireless subwoofer and rear satellite speakers included and retains the same angular look. But, the company says it reduced the size of the sub to less than half of the previous version. What&#39;s more, Samsung explains that it did so while providing even more powerful audio performance from the unit.

<p>Samsung's Frame series of TVs are one of the best solutions available for making a giant display blend more seamlessly into your home. At CES 2025, the company is expanding its lineup with the Frame Pro, a more advanced version of the TV that includes Samsung's top-of-the-line Neo QLED panel. The catch is that we don't yet know if Samsung is using a 4K or 8K panel here, a choice that'll significantly affect how much the Frame Pro costs when it eventually launches (Samsung hasn't provided a price or release date yet, in true CES fashion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the panel, the Frame Pro also uses Samsung's Wireless One Connect box, which lets you transmit content from consoles or set-top boxes to the TV without needing to plug things in directly. Instead, you plug into the Wireless One Connect and it'll beam things to the TV, which means you can make a much cleaner, cable-free setup that feels particularly useful with a set like the Frame.</p>

It’s not clear when the device, called <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bosch-smartlife.com/web/en/baby-crib.html">Revol</a>, may actually be available, but it’s able to track an impressive amount of data.</p>
<p>At first glance, the Revol looks somewhat similar to other smart bassinets like the ever-popular <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-18-snoo-smart-sleeper.html">Snoo</a>.

<p>Stress can really take a toll on a person, often in ways we don’t immediately recognize. Swiss startup Nutrix AG is hoping a quick, at-home spit test can help, by giving people a better idea of how stressed out they really are and the tools to manage it. At CES 2025, Nutrix showed off its cortiSense device, which measures levels of cortisol in saliva and can be used to track how this changes over time. The startup is planning to launch it by the end of the year, and it’ll work with the gSense app and digital platform to offer things like personalized wellness coaching from a medical team.</p> 
<p>It’s meant to be an easy and noninvasive way to identify and combat burnout. The part that’s a little sus, though? In a press release, Nutrix CEO Maria Hahn said the company is focusing on “empowering enterprises," noting that employee burnout can present “a significant challenge with a huge human and financial cost.” So, get your stress under control to better perform labor, I guess.</p>

<p>Concept devices are always tricky. For every one that gets turned into a real product a year later there are a thousand disappointments. Maybe the concept can’t be mass-produced affordably enough to make it viable to the business. Maybe the technology isn’t reliable enough to really make good on the promises its creators made during the glossy launch.

The weight of promises Halliday has laid upon the table is a sign of braggadocio, but it’ll take a while before we know if it’s deserved or not.</p>
<p>Halliday has turned up at CES 2025 in Las Vegas with a pair of eponymous smart glasses filled to the brim with technology. There’s a waveguide display in the right eyecup that will project the equivalent of a 3.5-inch screen into the wearer’s view. This display is also easy to read in strong light and the company promises the hardware is “invisible to onlookers.” The company adds the glasses weigh just 35 grams and promise eight

<p>Until today, I could count on one finger the amount of smart rings that offered a one-line ECG in such a small package. <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/circul-plus-ecg-ring-100035276.html">Bodimetrics’ Circul+</a> debuted in 2021, but what it had in heart-monitoring features it lacked in style, or even looking like a real ring. Today at CES 2025, however, <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/oura-circular-smart-ring-lawsuit-133032301.html">Circular</a> is launching its second-generation ring that promises to keep an eye on your heart health.</p>
<p>Circular says the Ring 2 boasts improved sensors as well as the aforementioned ECG, an eight day battery life and a better wireless charging dock. The company added that its companion app and AI has been completely redesigned to offer a “more intuitive and refined user experience.” Not to mention that the body is now cast in titanium with four color finishes; Gold, Silver, Black and Rose

<p>It’s not as if any period in human history was particularly gentle, but we do seem to live in very stressful times. Maybe it’s not the stress that’s changed, but that we’re more able than ever to notice, monitor and analyze what’s going on in our bodies. Here at CES 2025, startup Eli Health is launching Hormometer, an at-home kit that tests your <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-20-sensor-measures-stress-hormones-in-your-sweat.html">cortisol</a> and progesterone levels.</p>
<p>Hormometer is a wand with a collection tip at one end that you hold in your mouth for 60 seconds. Once it’s absorbed your spit, you’ll sit it down on a table for 20 minutes while the cartridge’s network of built-in microfluidics gets to work. After that, the assay will start displaying lines in a specific color, which can be read and interpreted by your smartphone camera.</p>

<p>We're here! The Engadget CES 2025 team has mostly arrived in Las Vegas, where we’ll be covering tech’s biggest annual conference. Our war room is open, the team has been seeing products and the coverage will ramp up in just a few short hours. Still, the show doesn't officially kick off for a couple of days, since the convention center is only truly open on January 7. But we'll have plenty of press conferences to cover tomorrow, and companies are already holding somewhat secretive briefings to preview their news.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, as well as observation of recent industry trends, it’s fairly easy to make educated predictions about what we might see here. Over the years, the focus of the conference has spanned areas like TVs, cars, smart home products and personal health, with a smattering of laptops and accessories thrown in. At CES 2025, we expect to see AI get even more pervasive in all areas of the show floor. But we are also likely to get the usual slew of new pro
