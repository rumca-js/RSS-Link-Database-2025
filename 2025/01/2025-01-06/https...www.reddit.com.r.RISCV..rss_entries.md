This went fairly smoothly in general. There are passthrough headers for the front panel connectors, and the NanoKVM includes the 0.1in extensions to connect to the motherboard. There were extra USB headers on the motherboard, and the existing jumper cable from the external USB-C connector was long enough to reach one of them on the motherboard, so that was fairly tidy.</p> <p>I also purchased a HDMI splitter and two HDMI cables, so that I could use the PC normally while sitting in
