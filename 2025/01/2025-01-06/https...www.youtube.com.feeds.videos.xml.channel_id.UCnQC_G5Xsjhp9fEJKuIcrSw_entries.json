        "description": "PureTalk - Exclusive discount for our listeners at: https://www.PureTalk.com/Shapiro\n\nAs Biden is leaving office, he has decided to give a Presidential Medal of Freedom to Hilary Clinton, George Soros, Bill Nye, and many more. He is also awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal to 20 recipients, including Liz Cheney and members of the House January 6th committee. In addition to these medals, Biden is also going to be putting in place a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling in vast areas ahead of the Trump administration. Ben also discusses the recent death of President Jimmy Carter. Many people are attempting to whitewash Carter\u2019s legacy in light of his death, but we shouldn\u2019t forget how he spent his time with dictators trying to cut deals and his support of literal terrorist groups. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Kick off 2025 with 25% off your new DailyWire+ annual membership.
