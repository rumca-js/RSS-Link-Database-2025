As Biden is leaving office, he has decided to give a Presidential Medal of Freedom to Hilary Clinton, George Soros, Bill Nye, and many more. He is also awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal to 20 recipients, including Liz Cheney and members of the House January 6th committee. In addition to these medals, Biden is also going to be putting in place a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling in vast areas ahead of the Trump administration. Ben also discusses the recent death of President Jimmy Carter. Many people are attempting to whitewash Carter‚Äôs legacy in light of his death, but we shouldn‚Äôt forget how he spent his time with dictators trying to cut deals and his support of literal terrorist groups.

With Speaker of the House Mike Johnson re-elected, Congress moves on to certifying President Trump‚Äôs historic win; the New Orleans attack reminds Americans of the threat of radical Islam; and Joe Biden honors pretty much every terrible person in America with the Medal of Freedom.
