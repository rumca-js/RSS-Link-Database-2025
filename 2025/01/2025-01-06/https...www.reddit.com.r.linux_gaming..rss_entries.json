I\u2019ve done a small amount of research and Bazzite looks like a great fit but I\u2019m open to suggestions.

I\u2019d also hate to have to download all the games I\u2019ve got again.

The machine is all AMD\u2014Ryzen 5600, B550 motherboard, and an RX 6600. Previously, it was running Fedora, but I was intrigued by the SteamOS console-like experience. Is it viable for dedicated Steam gaming on AMD hardware?</p> <p>What I Tried:I wiped Fedora and installed SteamOS. To my surprise, the process was smooth. Games like Elden Ring and Street Fighter 6 ran perfectly, and the controller integration felt seamless. I appreciate the immutable OS setup for its stability, especially for a PC that gets used primarily for gaming.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SugarLace8\"> /u/SugarLace8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hunkn4/steamos_on_amd_hardware_my_couch_pc_experience/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming",
