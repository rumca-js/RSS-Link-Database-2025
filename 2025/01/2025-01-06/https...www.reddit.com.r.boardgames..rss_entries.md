<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I played this game back in Spiel Essen 2018 with my brothers and a friend. I love the boardgame&#39;s theme, Wild West never bores me. It really reminds me to Bang! (players shoot each other), but the mechanichs are quite different. I love how the game manages the teaming part of the game, and the trade off between the guns and the effects on the cards. The way the game ends (with the showdown) seems to me very creative, themed, and funny. I don&#39;t know why this game isn&#39;t as popular as I thought it would be. I&#39;m really glad we bought a copy back then, I searched for it and Amazon&#39;s price is way to off (more than 30$). Did you know about this game?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>so over these last couple weeks I bought the game faraway to play with my extended family. I would do decent when playing it but never could consistently score within the top 2. I know most of what I think is basic strategy now like, putting the hardest to achieve and ideally highest scoring card at the front, creating a reset point at some point or the only point I shouldn&#39;t be taking a sanctuary, and making sure not to overextend biting off more resources than you would be able to reasonably afford i.e. three pineapple lookin things in your sanctuaries. Please tell me something&#39;s I can do to further my game or if some of these tips are blatantly wrong.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CbfDetectedLoser"> /u/CbfDetectedLoser </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hv1tkm/faraway_strategy_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/

I’m a casual player with boardgamer friends. I get to play serious board games a dozen times a year when we get together. As I was looking for a game to play with my wife, like many do, I discovered all the amazing content out there on youtube, BGG and here on reddit, and my curiosity got the better of me and I read and watched a lot about board games. </p> <p>This is how I stumbled upon youtubers ranking the best games of all time, and watched some. But it wasn’t really useful since, understandably, even hard-core board game players with extensive knowledge have their own experiences and their own preferences. So the more I watched, the less I knew about the best board games of all time. </p> <p>Of course, it is presumptuous to crown games as the best games of all time

So a gaming hall for open gaming, some optional events and activities, located in a serene small town surrounded by nature and with access to spa, hot springs, hiking etc.</p> <p>That&#39;s the main experience I want to create. So the accommodation is more &quot;high-end&quot; than in most conventions because it&#39;s an actual vacation - with a board game twist.</p> <p>And just to be transparent, I will not be charging any fees or commissions for the hotel, I want to get a good group discount to make it as affordable as possible - without compromising on quality.</p> <p>I have several options to choose from so your feedback will definitely help me decide.

It gets redundant very quickly. Just never go to dungeon, instead just ready yourself to fight in the next tile to appear.</p> <p>It seems there is no alternate path to get any meaningful number of VPs?

I don’t believe player 1 can use “Dispatcher” actions on player 2,3 or 4’s turn. But the card and rule book doesn’t state this rule. So my question is can player 1 use “Dispatcher” ability during another players turn. I’d hate to be wrong on this so if they cannot can someone please direct me to what page this rule is on.

Otherwise, it seems like there will always be jacks to draw from, which seems wrong. I couldn&#39;t find any reference in the rules that says they should be removed from game. In two player mode, it feels wrong to have them eternally available.</p> <p>2 - Pretend a first player leads with the Legionary role.
