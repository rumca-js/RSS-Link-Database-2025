But my overrides of webix.css only work with the <code>!important</code> tag.</p> <p>The imports look like:</p> <p><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{% static &#39;css/webix.css%} &quot;&gt;</code></p> <p><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{% static &#39;css/styles.css%} &quot;&gt;</code></p> <p>If I comment out the css class declaration from webix.css, the one in styles.css works when I SHIFT + reload.
