<p>The City should protest about US hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein’s attempt to seize control of seven trusts</p><p>Saba Capital’s proposals are “self-serving and destructive”, says the chair of one of seven London-listed investment trusts in the firing line of the New York hedge fund. Another is “appalled by Saba’s action and conduct”. A third says Saba is pursuing “a backdoor attempt to seize control of the trust”. A fourth thinks Saba is following an “unknown and unproven” strategy and, similarly, is trying to “take control of your company for its own economic benefit”.</p><p>When opinion is so uniform, it is tempting to take the opposite side and suspect a case of vested City interests feeling threatened. After all, the popular criticism of investment trusts – companies that invest in other companies – is that there are too many of them and that their boards are complacent even when share prices trade at frustratingly wide discounts to the value of the underlying assets.</p> <

<p>A beautifully simple vegetable soup/stew with a link to Italian folklore</p><p>Once upon a time in Messina, there lived a boy named Nick who loved to swim. Or so begins the tale of Cola Pesce, told by many, including Italo Calvino in his book of Italian folktales. So great was his love that Nick spent his days and nights in the sea while his mother stood on the shore, pleading: “Oh, Nick, come out of the water, you are not a fish<em>.</em>” He didn’t listen, though, and every day he swam farther out while his desperate mum yelled across the water until it gave her a kink in her intestines. Then, one day, having screamed herself hoarse, she blurted out – as is so often the case in such circumstances – “Nick, may you turn into a fish.” And he did – or, rather, he turned into a half-fish, half-man, with webbed feet like a duck and a throat like a frog. And that was that; Nick never set foot on land again, which upset his mum so much that she died.</p><p>As is also the case in such ci

<p>The latest in our series of Guardian writers picking their go-to happy movies is a look back at 1998’s unlikely buddy comedy</p><p>There’s many a time in a grocery store or CVS when Fantasy by Mariah Carey comes on, and all I can think of is Rush Hour. It’s 1997, and in the backseat of a car the Chinese consul’s daughter Soo-yung (played by an 11-year-old Julia Hsu) belts sweet fantasy in the only way a Mariah song can be belted, her stone-faced bodyguards in front wading through Los Angeles traffic. To 10-year-old me, who sang about heartbreak and desire with similar vigor in front of her immigrant parents, it was a quintessentially American moment. There’s pure joy in Soo-yung’s face before we cut to the scene at large, as the car is directed to the side. A police car swings in front of them and a man gets out, unflinchingly shoots the bodyguards and abducts Soo-yung.</p><p>And thus the crux of the plot in this 1998 action comedy is set in motion. For the rescue-important-person

<p>The Earth is dying and the only hope is a distant planet in a game that is a playable blend of Alien and The Thing</p><p>Supermassive’s games have always been cinematic, from the persuasive performances of slasher-horror Until Dawn to the chillier atmosphere of interactive ghost story Man of Medan. This time around, with sci-fi horror Directive 8020, the studio wears its Hollywood influences even more brazenly on its sleeve.</p><p>The Earth is dying, and humanity’s last hope is a planet called Tau Ceti F. Yet as the crew of colony ship Cassiopeia survey the promising planet, they soon discover that they aren’t alone. Stalked by a horrifying alien organism that can chillingly mimic its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit these predators and return home, with each former friend and crewmate now a potential threat.

<p>Sure, Shōgun deserved to win big. But there were some horrific snubs in last night’s television awards, from The Penguin to Slow Horses</p><p>The Golden Globes are very much an awards ceremony of two halves. The movie side of things is always exciting, given that the Golden Globes function as a bellwether for the Oscars. As such, from the results of last night’s ceremony we can predict that Demi Moore and The Brutalist are likely to do very well come March. This is why 90% of the headlines you’ll read about the Golden Globes this morning will be about film.</p><p>But the Golden Globes also gives out awards to television programmes. This used to be exciting too, because the Hollywood Foreign Press Association used to be so corrupt it would just hand nominations to whoever gave its members the biggest present, as was the case when Emily in Paris landed a pair of nominations in 2021 after HFPA voters were flown to France and put up in opulent hotel rooms.

<p>Guardiola warns Grealish over Savinho, Southampton hit new low and is Arsenal’s negativity holding them back? </p><p>So much about Trent Alexander-Arnold’s display on Sunday was puzzling. Real Madrid’s now-public courtship may have had something to do with it, but at times it felt he was being hung out to dry. Poorly as he played, he was deliberately exposed by his own team, left to deal with whatever threats Manchester United could conjure down their left flank while the only players likely to drop back and help him out, Mohamed Salah and Ryan Gravenberch, rarely did so. When it became obvious that he was having an off day, nothing was done to cover for it and nurse him back into the game. When his own poor clearance was returned in the buildup to United’s opening goal it found him briefly with four opponents to deal with by himself, demonstrating that Liverpool’s problems down the right were not just an individual but a systemic issue. He is (usually) an astonishingly good playe

<p>The party wants to seem in control. But many of its MPs have knife-edge majorities that a challenger could obliterate</p><p>Labour campaigned for 14 years to get rid of the Tories, and emerged from the general election with the biggest majority in recent history. So why, after only six months, do so many Labour supporters feel anxious? The persistently depressing polling figures and Labour’s vote dropping like a stone in many council byelections don’t help.</p><p>The harsh reality is that Labour was not elected on a wave of popularity. The first-past-the-post vote system masked Labour’s low vote share, which was just 34%. The first six months in office have also been marred by a list of policies that have unnecessarily alienated section after section of Labour support: cutting the winter fuel allowance, refusing to scrap the two-child benefit limit, denying Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women a semblance of justice and increasing tuition fees for young people.

As an amateur yet aspiring photographer, Nolan offered his “subpar, A-level art photos”.</p><p>Connections were made and this led to Nolan getting a gig photographing the weekly London indie club night Frog.

Reflecting a collective desire for better opportunities abroad, the existence of these services speaks to the difficulty of navigating the visa application process on your own.

<p>In front of the camera Monroe was luminous, but in this reissued and sumptuous collection of pictures Arnold also captured the insecurity and pain</p><p>The story is told of Marilyn Monroe and a friend walking down Fifth Avenue one day in the 1950s discussing Marilyn Monroe. MM was wearing a headscarf and a plain, belted raincoat. The friend remarked on the great difference there was between the woman he knew and the star the world thought it knew. “You want me to be her?” Marilyn said. “Watch.” She whipped off the scarf, opened the raincoat, thrust out her chest and put on The Walk. Within seconds, she was surrounded by a gaggle of excited fans clamouring for her autograph.</p><p>Monroe was one of the 20th century’s great clowns, whose clowning was intended not to make us laugh – though she was wonderfully funny – but to lose ourselves in fantasies of longing and desire. Most movie stars act the part of themselves, more or less convincingly; Marilyn created a wholly other version

He was complaining to me about what he viewed as a lack of loyalty and commitment among the younger workers he manages – both millennials and gen Z. I imagine the manager is, himself, a good boss; at least, the person I know is sympathetic, flexible, and has admitted to me that he would give everyone raises if he could. So I held my tongue.

<p>Clinical psychologist and author Dr Julie Smith on handling stress, setting boundaries and helping each other</p><p>On a piece of paper, jot down the different areas of your life that you value – health, career progression, parenting, intimate relationships, friendships, social life. In each box, write a few words about what you want to contribute. Then rate each out of 10 in terms of how important it is to you, and rate it again out of 10, based on how much you feel you’re living in line with that. Those scores give an indication of where you might have been taken away from something that matters to you. For example, your relationship may be 10 out of 10 important, but it’s a 2 out of 10 in terms of how much you’re showing up recently. This isn’t a tool for self-criticism, because it’s normal that life pulls us in different directions, but it gives you clarity. Balance isn’t a perfect sweet spot that you achieve; it’s like walking along a balance beam – you’re constantly noticing

<p>It’s got triple-height splendour and 1550s wall paintings likely inspired by Emperor Nero’s villa in Rome. Our writer plays lord of the manor at Calverley Hall – once home to knights, weavers, stonemasons and murderers</p><p>A ghostly bearded face peers out from the wall of a bedroom, flanked by a pair of winged, snake-like beasts baring their teeth, their necks chained to an ermine roundel. The pattern repeats around the room like psychedelic wallpaper, featuring slithery creatures with long curling tongues, a jester in a horned cap, and mysterious figures with clownish faces and barrels for bodies, all crowned with a frieze of white Yorkshire roses.</p><p>This trippy scene, in <a href="https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/calverley-old-hall-5219/#Overview">Calverley Old Hall in West Yorkshire</a>, is one of the most important surviving Tudor wall paintings in the country, thought to date from the 1550s, when it was likely inspired by <a href="https://the-p

<p>Winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade means Pat Cummins’ Australian side has won every Test trophy on offer to them. But his ageing side is crying out for new blood</p><p>After a hard-fought fifth Test victory over India to clinch the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a 3-1 margin, the post-series press conference with Pat Cummins, wearing a weary grin under a pink brim, began with a juicy full toss of a question: “As a captain,” the journalist asked, “do you feel you have completed cricket now?”</p><p>It was in some ways justified. Having become the first Australia Test captain since Mark Taylor on the 1997 Ashes campaign to turn a 0-1 deficit into a five-Test series triumph, Cummins’ side now hold the trophies in every one of their bilateral Test series. They also won the 2023 ODI World Cup in India and will defend their World Test Championship mace against South Africa in the final at Lord’s in June.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/

<p>Helen Pidd and Alexandra Topping have been close friends for almost 20 years. But struggles with fertility and new motherhood tested their bond to the limit</p><p>In the summer of 2006, <strong>Helen Pidd</strong> met her fellow Guardian journalist <strong>Alexandra Topping</strong>. It was “a little bit like falling in love”, says Lexy, as the pair bonded over their jobs, through chaotic nights out and on holidays together. Their similarities drew them together, explains Helen: “The two blonde babies of the Guardian newsroom, both from the north-west of England, both a bit gobby.” They told each other everything.</p><p>It was a friendship they both cherished, and it was only strengthened as their lives changed. They both fell in love, and Helen left the country and returned. They prided themselves on their ability to speak hard truths, safe in the knowledge that “the other person isn’t going to, you know, strop off into the distance and never speak to you again”.</p> <a href="htt
