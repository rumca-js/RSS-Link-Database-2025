Through a two year collaboration, we crafted guardrails to a complex system that allowed maximum flexibility to exist alongside common sense restrictions in a single system. We did so successfully thanks to the input and consensus of our huge C++ developer community. \n\nBloomberg's C++ code generator was created 18 years ago to simplify the task of writing services and code to call those services, freeing up engineers from writing boilerplate code and allowing them to concentrate on writing code that provides business value.
