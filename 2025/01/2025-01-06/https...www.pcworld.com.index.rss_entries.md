<p>You probably haven’t seen HP’s Z series of computers unless you’re working in an office with some “big iron,” packed with high-end hardware and specialized designs. But HP’s new Z2 Mini G1a, shown off at a pre-CES presentation, caught my attention in a big way. It’s a mini desktop PC with some of the most powerful parts available.</p>



<p>First, the chassis. This thing is almost a literal brick, at least in terms of size and weight, albeit a fashionable one. HP didn’t provide me with dimensions at the presentation, but it’s approximately the size of a two-drive NAS setup, or maybe one-third as small as the smallest Mini-ITX desktop I’ve seen. Much bigger than a typical “mini PC” sold to consumers, yet still a fraction of the size of a conventional desktop PC.</p>

<p>AMD launched the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D mobile processor for gaming laptops at CES 2025, staking its own, bold claim as the world’s best mobile processor for gaming and content creation.</p>



<p>AMD separately added a pair of new processors, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the Ryzen 9 9900X3D, to its desktop product lineup during a press conference at the CES show in Las Vegas. Like the 9955HX3D, those chips add massive amounts of on-package V-Cache for powerful gaming performance — leading AMD to boast that they were the world’s best gaming <em>and </em>productivity processors, period. AMD took a similar approach with the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, packing a slightly smaller amount of cache inside a chip optimized for laptops.</p>



<p>AMD launched the three new “Fire Range” processors for mobile gaming on Monday. The Ryzen 9 9955HX3D leads the way, of course, plus two more

<p>AMD has typically pushed the envelope in performance, but at CES 2025, the company is also expanding in another direction, with cheaper, lower-performance Ryzen AI 300 and even a Ryzen 200 family that the company is encouraging both consumers and commercial customers to buy.</p>



<p>In June, AMD launched the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2353351/amds-ryzen-ai-300-is-built-to-dominate-thin-light-copilot-laptops.html">Ryzen AI 300 family</a>, which combined 50 TOPS of AI power with a ton of conventional performance in our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2411004/benchmarked-amds-ryzen-ai-300-brings-serious-performance-to-copilot-laptops.html">Ryzen AI 300 review</a>, including in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2521204/amd-claims-ryzen-ai-300-blows-intel-away-in-gaming-by-75-percent.html">gaming performance as well</a>.

<p>AMD has launched what one executive called “the most advanced mobile X86 processor ever created” at CES 2025: The Ryzen AI Max and AI Max+, with absolutely massive capabilities to run graphics and AI workloads.</p>



<p>AMD is positioning this “Strix Halo” chip as a sort of hybrid for graphics and AI workstations, comparing it to Nvidia’s existing GeForce 4090 GPU in terms of running AI LLMs at up to 70 billion parameters. But the Ryzen AI Max offers more than just that. </p>



<p>It’s an APU with graphics capabilities that push into discrete GPU territory — in the 3DMark Steel Nomad benchmark, for example, the chip offers 258 percent the graphics performance of Intel’s Core Ultra 9 288V (Arrow Lake) CPU. It also offers excellent AI performance, both with or without the NPU.</p>

<p>Gamers hoping for deep details were left wanting, however, as AMD classified this as a “preview” without much hard information. It was more of a tease than anything, honestly, though it’s clear that AMD is finally, truly embracing AI hardware within GPUs. Here’s what we <em>do</em> know.</p>

<p>Today at CES, Acer unveiled 2025 versions of its lightweight Swift Go and eco-friendly Aspire Vero line of laptops. These models boast the latest Intel Core Ultra 200H processors as well as high-speed 5G and Wi-Fi 7 connectivity. Essentially, they’re lighter and more powerful than previous iterations. </p>



<p>Here at PCWorld, we really dig Acer’s Swift Go laptops. In our <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2315344/acer-swift-go-14-review-4.html">review</a> of the 2024 model, which we awarded 4 stars out of 5, we described it as a “reliable travel workhorse through and through.” Not only was day-to-day performance quite good, but it also weighed just a little over three pounds.</p>

<p>Today at CES 2025, Acer announced their newest Nitro V AI lineup of gaming laptops infused with artificial intelligence. Not only are they designed to consume less power (and extend battery life), but they also feature AI-powered graphics thanks to Nvidia’s DLSS 3.5 technology.</p>



<p>AI really is an all-consuming thing, huh? Let’s jump into the details.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="acers-nitro-v-ai-laptops">Acer’s Nitro V AI laptops</h2>



<p>The Acer Nitro V AI comes in three different sizes: 15 inches, 16 inches, and 17 inches. Personally, I’m a big fan of various size options, as some folks will prefer the more portable 15-inch variety while others may want the bigger 17-inch display for maximum immersion. </p>

<p>The Steam Deck has been the template for handheld gaming PCs for almost three years now, with its competitors all following the same form factor to a greater or lesser degree. Acer has already designed something like that — <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2446555/acer-offers-new-nitro-gaming-laptops-and-a-steam-deck-clone.html">the Nitro Blaze 7</a> — but, at CES 2025, it’s ready to go bigger. Much, <em>much</em> bigger… with the Nitro Blaze 11, which is part Steam Deck, part Nintendo Switch, part iPad, built around a massive screen.</p>



<p>The central feature is a 10.95-inch 2560×1600 IPS display, extending the slightly taller 16:10 ratio to a much higher resolution you’d normally only see on a premium laptop. It’s also faster than usual for a handheld with its 144Hz refresh rate.</p>

<p>At CES 2025, AMD revealed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D for desktop PCs, which the company is calling both the “world’s best gaming processor” <em>and</em> the “world’s best processor for content creation.”</p>



<p>On paper, the comparison is brutal: AMD says its new chip is 20 percent faster in gaming than Intel’s Arrow Lake flagship, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2499641/core-ultra-9-285k-review-10-must-know-facts-intel-new-desktop-cpus.html">Core Ultra 285K</a>.</p>



<p>AMD will ship the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and a second Ryzen 9 chip with v-cache, the Ryzen 9900X3D, to PC makers and customers beginning in the first quarter of 2025. Both of AMD’s new desktop chips outperform the existing Ryzen 9800X3D in terms of clock speed and core count — and give buyers additional choices to fill out their gaming systems.

<p>CES 2025 hasn’t even kicked off yet, but thanks to AMD, we’re already getting a glimpse of what’s to come: the next generation of PC gaming handhelds. AMD announced that its hotly anticipated Ryzen Z2 processor is ready to rock after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I6713BI1Bk">first revealing the chip at Computex</a> last summer.</p>



<p>AMD’s initial Z1 chip powered most of the first wave of gaming handhelds, while Valve’s Steam Deck uses a close custom-made sibling. AMD says the Z2 can provide “console-class” graphics that last for hours and hours, though it didn’t disclose any benchmarks or deeper performance context. (To be fair, that’s difficult since the design limitations of handhelds can drastically affect performance.)</p>

<p>Branding is important. Corporations spend millions of dollars every year to make sure that words like “Tacoma” and “Sleep Number” press the right buttons in your brain. And Dell has spent decades putting that same work in for terms like “XPS,” “Inspiron,” and “Latitude.”</p>



<p>Starting in 2025, though, Dell laptops and desktops will just be… Dell. “There’s just one brand,” said executive Sam Burd. “Dell.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dude-its-just-dell">Dude, it’s just Dell</h2>



<p>Before I get into editorializing, let me clear a few things up.</p>



<p>The actual designs that Dell has been working on aren’t going away. So, for example, the XPS 13 that’s been a staple of high-end laptops for years isn’t being discontinued, and it isn’t even being replaced with a new model. It’s just that the 2025 version will be called the “Dell 13 Plus.

<p>At CES 2025, Intel said it plans to ship additional Arrow Lake desktop chips this month, alongside two new desktop chips that have already begun to surface in motherboards for desktop PCs.</p>



<p>Intel introduced the world to the desktop version of Arrow Lake in October 2024, with five Core Ultra 200S chips, many featuring the “K” suffix that signals that they can be overclocked. Eventually, Intel plans to ship about 30 Core Ultra 200S chips, executives said at CES.</p>



<p>For now, however, Intel is highlighting three, which are all slated to ship later in January 2025:</p>

<p>Microsoft debuted Phi Silica at its Build conference in Seattle last May, showing off the Small Language Model (SLM) that’s meant to complement its Large Language Model (LLM) that runs in the cloud. Phi Silica paves the way for a local version of Copilot to run on Windows PCs.</p>



<p>Typically, LLMs are faster and more accurate than SLMs. However, they need to run in the cloud and can require expensive subscriptions for full access. On the other hand, SLMs can run AI chatbots and other AI-driven applications on a local PC, but they’re less sophisticated and they require <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2457268/what-the-heck-is-an-npu-anyway-everything

<p>It’s never fun having to navigate an on-screen keyboard using only the directional pad on a remote control, but <a href="https://www.direction9.com">Direction9</a> has a plan to make it more tolerable.

<p>If you’re too young to remember the T9 layout, it looks like this: At the center of the keyboard is a 3×3 grid of keys, representing numbers 1-9. With the exception of number 1, each number key also corresponds to a cluster of letters. The 2 key contains the letters abc, the 3 key contains def, the 4 key

<p>Deep within your computer is a blueprint that specifies a certain “language” of machine instructions it can understand and execute. This blueprint (called the “instruction set architecture”) sits between your computer’s software and hardware.</p>



<p>In order for any given app to function properly on your computer, it needs to “speak” the same language — that way your computer can understand what it wants to do and perform the proper actions on the hardware.</p>



<p>Until now, different instruction set architectures have been proprietary and incompatible with each other (except via emulation, which is like real-time translation between blueprint languages). The x86 and Arm architectures are the best-known real-world examples.</p>

<p>Google is bringing its Gemini AI assistant to smart TVs in a bigger way this year, with the ultimate goal of getting people to pay for it in some way.</p>



<p>Several television makers plan to announce new Google TV sets with Gemini built in at CES this week. The smart TVs include far-field microphones that respond to “Hey Google” voice commands, and they’ll use proximity sensors to detect how far you’re standing from the TV, showing artwork from far away and an informational dashboard up-close.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Gemini will begin handling some voice commands on TVs. This will allow for more nuanced movie and TV show requests, such as “suggest a movie like Jurassic Park, but suitable for young children.” It’ll also provide longer answers for certain types of knowledge queries, with suggested YouTube videos to match.</p>



<p>None of these features wi

## Microsoft disguises Bing as Google to fool inattentive searchers

<p>Microsoft would really, really, <em>really</em> like you to use Bing, its self-branded search engine that competes against Google’s monopoly. Not only is it <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2509630/how-the-windows-search-uses-google-instead-of-bing.html">hardwired into much of Windows</a> and other Microsoft products like the Edge browser, it also employs a lot of sneaky visual tricks to steer you away from Google itself. But the company’s latest trick is more, well, tricky — in fact, it’s just straight-up Google camouflage.</p>



<p>This morning, users are discovering that if they search for “Google” in the primary Bing interface, they’re shown a special Bing search page. Before you scroll down to the actual search results, you’re presented with an all-white page with a centered, unbranded search bar and a multicolored doodle above it that’s heav

<p>The Aqara Panel Hub S1 Plus is Aqara’s first in-wall control panel. The device’s 6.9-inch touchscreen offers centralized control for smart homes and can function as either a Zigbee hub or a Matter bridge. The S1 Plus features an understated design that should blend with almost any home decor.</p>

<p>About seven years after the HDMI 2.1 specification was introduced, the HDMI Forum has announced the next generation: HDMI 2.2, which will require new cables to take advantage of its most high-performance features. It will not require a new connector, though, thankfully.</p>



<p>Though the HDMI Forum is officially calling the new specification HDMI 2.2, the accompanying cable will also receive a new name: Ultra96. All told, the selling point of both the Ultra96 cable and HDMI 2.2 specification are the increased bandwidth, which <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/583074/hdmi-21-has-arrived-heres-everything-you-need-to-know.html">doubles the HDMI 2.1 bandwidth</a> from 48Gbps to a staggering 96Gbps.</p>



<p>At this point, however, the HDMI Forum is only talking conceptually about the new specification. Companies who are part of the new HDMI adopter

<p>The <a href="https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperspace-trackpad-pro">HyperSpace TrackPad Pro</a> is one of a handful of technology devices that I like, but it might not be quite ready for prime time.</p>



<p>The concept is simple enough: It’s a mammoth haptic trackpad that’s primarily designed for people who don’t already own one. The external trackpad connects via USB-C and measures 3.85 inches x 6.29 inches (98mm x 160 mm) and maybe half an inch thick. That’s a huge trackpad for most users, and Hyper (which was acquired by Targus in 2021 for its peripherals capabilities) thinks that most PC users need one.</p>



<p>And to be fair, I agree. Most PC users <em>should</em> have one. Virtually all laptops ship with a good-to-decent trackpad, and more and more of them are following Apple’s lead in adding haptics (the force feedback technology that simul

<p>Getting out of bed to turn off the lights is as annoying as it gets, but this smart button pusher from SwitchBot can help solve that problem in a blink. Even better, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-switch-button-controlled-compatible/dp/B07B7NXV4R/">SwitchBot Smart Switch is now just $20 on Amazon</a>, down 30 percent from its usual price.</p>



<p>The SwitchBot Smart Switch is a tiny gadget that’s easy to install and control. Stick it onto any physical button — like a rocker-style light switch — using the included adhesive strip. Then install the SwitchBot app on your phone to get it paired for remote control.</p>



<p>SwitchBot’s remote button pusher is so useful to have because it isn’t something you ever have to change out (like a light bulb). It’s also cheaper than replacing your existing switches with smart switches. After installing

<p>Following their debut back in September during the CEDIA 2024 conference, GE’s Proseo lights and shades are taking another bow at CES alongside GE Lighting’s new café lights, dimmer switches, and outdoor light strips. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, GE Lighting parent Savant is debuting its own smart system aimed at helping consumers keep a lid on their energy bills. </p>

<p>Two of Ring’s best home security cameras—the Ring Spotlight Cam Pro and the Ring Floodlight Cam Pro—are getting a surprise upgrade to 2K video resolution.</p>



<p>Most Ring home security cameras, including those two, are—or at least have been—limited to video resolution of 1080p. The home security company has seemed much more interested in bringing features like the radar motion detection that powers its higher-end cameras’ Birds Eye View feature than boosting video resolution.</p>



<p>So, Ring’s announcement at CES that a simple firmware update will enable these ostensibly 1080p cameras to start capturing video in 2K resolution left us wondering how that could be possible. Well, it turns out both cameras, introduced in 2022 and 2021 respectively, were manufactured with 2K image sensors at the outset. Ring has simply been throttling them to 1920 x 1080
