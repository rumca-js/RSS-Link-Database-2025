In a twist that highlights the absurdity of UK libel laws, former Prime Minister Liz Truss is threatening to sue current PM Keir Starmer for saying she &#8220;crashed the economy&#8221; during her chaotic 49 days in office… conveniently forgetting that she made the exact same accusation against an earlier PM herself. That&#8217;s right, Truss, whose [&#8230;]

I don&#8217;t know what kind of warrant system they&#8217;re running in Pennsylvania, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like a good one. Either the system is deliberately broken, or the testifying cops were playing fast and loose with the facts. Whatever the case is, the end result is the loss of the evidence obtained with Schrodinger&#8217;s Warrant, [&#8230;]

For quite some time now, we’ve pointed out how Jim Jordan has weaponized the government to suppress speech. Quite frequently, he seems to be doing this in coordination with Elon Musk. And yet, somehow, it felt like we were the only ones calling this out. So many in the media seem fine repeating the lie [&#8230;]

In February 2024, AT&#38;T bungled a network update causing a massive outage that it took AT&#38;T twelve hours to fix. DownDetector lit up with 70,000 problem reports. The outage impacted an estimated 125 million wireless devices, blocked an estimated 92 million phone calls by AT&#38;T customers, and prevented an estimated 25,000 attempts to reach 911. A [&#8230;]

Well, I&#8217;ll give the Ninth Circuit this much: at least when the court is wrong, it is wrong fast. It was just a few weeks back that we discussed Molson Coors&#8217; appeal for both the rulings and damages over its trademark fight with Stone Brewing. For those not familiar with the history here, here&#8217;s a [&#8230;]
