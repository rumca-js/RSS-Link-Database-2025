Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we’ll do a deeper dive into the DEI program in the Los Angeles Fire Department. The Left insists that it has nothing to do with the catastrophe unfolding in LA right now—but they’re lying. Also, how many of these fires are being intentionally set? We’ll talk about that. And, an OnlyFans hooker films herself propositioning a fast food worker. She humiliates herself in the process. Speaking of humiliating herself, Meghan Markle is back again with a new TV show. The audience reception has been unenthused, to put it mildly.

The city of Los Angeles is going up in flames. The Left claims it’s a product of “climate change,” but that’s because they don’t want to talk about the real cause, which is incompetence—if not outright sabotage—by the Democratic leaders of LA and California.
