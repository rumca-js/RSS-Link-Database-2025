I used to code on Linux, but for the past 4 years I've been coding on WSL2. Now, I’m going back to true Linux: NixOS. I've never used NixOS, but I've heard great things about it and it seems super interesting so figured I'd give it a shot.

In this video, I'm putting together a Dual PC setup: one with NixOS for coding and the other with Windows (i know i know, but i need it for content and gaming), and I'll be using a capture card to get the NixOS video feed over to my content machine. Then, I get NixOS installed and configured with the following (parenthesis list the lang each tool is written in):

OS: NixOS (Nix)
WM: Hyprland (C++)
Bar: Waybar (written in C++). I'll try out here soon hyprpanel, but it's written in TS and I guess it’s bloated because there are reports of freezing and lagging... but it sure is pretty.
Launcher: Rofi-wayland (C)
Terminal: foot (C). I like alacritty and have heard good things about
