<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to de-google the whole day, I was able to degoogle chrome/google, (I&#39;m working on the Google photos lol, I just don&#39;t know how to import all my photos from there to a different gallery app), degoogled messaging app and dial app, degoogled the calculator app, and I degoogled the aboard. I&#39;m slowly getting there..... I will eventually get to the email and Google photos... They&#39;re the big projects LOL. If y&#39;all any more recs for private and secure alternative de-google apps plz lmk! Also I&#39;m wondering if switching from Android to Apple would be a better idea, because I&#39;ve read that iOS is more secure and private than Android... I currently I haven&#39;t an Android RN. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot_Valuable1027"> /u/Hot_Valuable1027 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hygg6b/good_google_alarm_clock_alternatives/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Please forgive my newbie vibe but: I know some of the Google tracking out there is challenging to work around, but I&#39;m trying my best.</p> <p>I&#39;ve ditched Meta and Gmail but I unfortunately used them for years. On my desktop, I switched to Linux, use Mullvad browser or LibreWolf over a trusted veep, or bridged T/T, along with Ublk and NS, and try to obfuscate fingerprinting.</p> <p>But I want to isolate my different browsing as effectively as I can, especially with signing in to various accounts. I&#39;ve heard that using VMs or containerization helps but I&#39;m not clear on how that might work.</p> <p>It seems clunky to create multiple lightweight VMs for different browsing, but so does using, say, Docker containers (which confuses me anyway).</p> <p>No matter how I set either up, doesn&#39;t the outgoing traffic still look like it&#39;s from the same place, whether through my veep service or ISP, and thus identify me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In general I don&#39;t have auto-updates enabled for anything and from time to time I manually check updates for my android apps using aurora store.<br/> A couple of times during manual update check aurora store showed me there&#39;s an update for an app, but this update comes from beta channel of the app.<br/> I use anonymized account and I don&#39;t feel like aurora store has any settings where I can disable beta channel updates for apps.</p> <p>Is this assumption correct and this behavior cannot be disabled (checking beta channel for updates)?</p> <p>The solution is kind of obvious in my case - just NOT update the app since I&#39;m doing it manually anyway.<br/> But anyway curious if anyone noticed that because I couldn&#39;t find any discussions about that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rebelvg"> /u/rebelvg </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1hy8qfx/questio

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I would like to share with you, that I found out, there is a project 20 years in development, originally called Maidsafe, now renamed to Autonomi to be released this month. It looks like it used to be very promising project 10 years ago, but they had too many technical difficulties. Now it looks like they finally smashed them all. </p> <p>It is decentralized replacement of current internet. Ultimate anonymity, privacy, no censorship, no tracking. P2P network, where you can store any private data forever. Basically, you can host there any static web, any data, public or private and nobody will ever be able to find out it is yours, or what is it. Data is dynamically moving all the time between nodes. </p> <p>I am new to this, so I am still learning. We will see in a few weeks whether this really works. It is now at pre-release state, you can try final test version, currently tens of thousands of nodes online. If it works well, we will hav

I have tested this with native GMS phone as well as basic GMS only implementation, as well as microG, but none of them worked without actually logging into Google account.</p> <p>(It also forced me to use Google login) I don&#39;t want my personal ID to be tied with Google account. Is there way around it? Like why the fixation on Google? All they need is face verification and that&#39;s about it. I need to use the app for application, or go there in person but time will not work for me.</p> <p>There are other apps like banking apps that also require not just GMS but signed in Playstore.</p> <p>The popup says : make sure Playstore is installed and you are using the up to date version of the app.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/T_rex2700"> /u/T_re
