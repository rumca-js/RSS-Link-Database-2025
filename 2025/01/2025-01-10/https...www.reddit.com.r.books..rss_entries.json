It\u2019s the kind of book that sticks with you long after you\u2019ve finished it. That said, there\u2019s one aspect of it that didn\u2019t sit quite right with me, but overall, this is a must-read. I finished it in just two or three days, and if I didn\u2019t have school or other obligations, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve devoured it in one sitting.</p> <p>This was my first time reading <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>, though because of its popularity, I felt like I already knew quite a bit about it before picking it up. The book is often classified as science fiction, but I think anyone who enjoys fiction in general will get something meaningful out of it. It\u2019s not science fiction in the traditional sense\u2014no spaceships or aliens here. Personally, I love those kinds of stories, but I know they\u2019re not for everyone. Regardless, don\u2019t let the genre label deter you.</p> <p>What sets <em>",

The story establishes the neighborhood so naturally, and the beautiful prose slowly pieces together a detailed painting of the fictional town.</p> <p>I particularly love how Scout often tells stories as a direct consequence of some event in her life. It&#39;s a wonderfully human way to explore the deeper knowledge behind her childlike curiosities. It also helps that Harper Lee&#39;s dry wit keeps many character descriptions amusing, and makes them come alive in the mind&#39;s eye.</p> <p>Speaking of the characters, I adore Scout and her family. The protective yet flighty Jem, the stoic yet comforting Atticus, and the intimidating yet warm Calpurnia establish just how important good role models are for a growing child. </p> <p>But what elevates To Kill a Mockingbird for me past a simple slice of life is how bluntly it pulls the rug from Scout and the",
