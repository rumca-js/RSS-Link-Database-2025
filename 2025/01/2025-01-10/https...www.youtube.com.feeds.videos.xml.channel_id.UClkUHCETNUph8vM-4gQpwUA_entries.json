Thanks to Plaion and Warhorse, I got a copy of the game a few days and I've been able to play since then but I'm only able to give you guys my impressions from the first 8 to 10 hours of the game. So that's what this video is going to be and we will have a full review of the game later on. But for now, let's talk about what we think of the game so far\n\nhttps://kingdomcomedeliverance2.wiki.fextralife.com/Kingdom+Come+Deliverance+2+Wiki\n\nTimestamp \n0:00 - Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Hands-On Impressions\n0:36 - The Beginning and Recap\n1:42 - Can be overwhelming\n3:04 - Polished Game\n3:55 - Reactive World\n4:42 - My Chaotic Playstyle\n5:54 - Challenging but rewarding combat\n7:48 - Save System\n8:07 - Good Dialogue and Great Music\n8:55 - Graphics\n10:10 - My thoughts",
