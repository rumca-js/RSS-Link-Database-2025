<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just moved to Jersey City and looking for any hacker groups/meetups in the area and in NYC. I tend to screw around in CTFs and develop security tools as a hobby. Looking for a mix of fun and some professional networking on the side. Any advice appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nuvious"> /u/Nuvious </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hy5r4w/hacking_meetups_in_nycjersey_city/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1hy5r4w/hacking_meetups_in_nycjersey_city/">[comments]</a></span>
