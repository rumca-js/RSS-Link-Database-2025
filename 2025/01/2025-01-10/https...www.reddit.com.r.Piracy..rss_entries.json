Plus I like having the digital version because I am dyslexic and so I prefer to copy my readings into microsoft word because of its excelent text to speech program. </p> <p>Well the jokes on me, despite paying to have the thing permanently, not only does it not let me just download the thing, but there&#39;s a fucking copy limit. 20% of the book max permanently. It says you can download it for offline use but despite downloading it, it doesn&#39;t show up in my downloaded files. </p> <p>Y&#39;all seem like the folks who would know how to crack this shit, anyone have any ideas. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dovahkiin419\"> /u/Dovahkiin419 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",
