I&#39;m not particularly into the new adult romantacy wave, but I also can&#39;t make myself get through a lot of the extremely dense, worldbuilding heavy (and often bafflingly misogynistic?) juggernaughts of the classic high fantasy genre.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hi! i’ve mostly stayed away from books because i feel like i can’t find what really interests me; character driven stories with a vast cast where nobody is really the main character. i don’t particularly like fantasy, romance, or main protagonists, i love the idea of a book where characters switch perspectives every chapter or so, but it doesn’t have to be that way. i also like the idea of third person where every character is focused on by a non-protagonist narrator. the only thing i can think of that fits this is “one of us is lying” by karen mcmanus, but i find the concept and setting kind of cringe/tumblr-esque. really i just want to read about a cast of friends who all have their own struggles, backstories, personalities, styles, and quirks and see them navigate their lives and their friendships/relationships. is this too much to ask? does it not exist? thank you in advance!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://ww

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I read “Things We Never Got Over” and I honestly did not like it. It’s strange because it kept me captivated enough that I didn’t feel that it was a waste and I also SPEED read it. I think it only took me 2 days. The style of writing gave me Wattpad vibes though and I felt the dialogue between characters was just not real. I found myself cringing at some points. That’s nothing against the author, this is just something way different than I usually read. I did want to know Lucian and Sloan’s story though. I was honestly hoping to get it in that book, but we didn’t. Then I found out the last book in the series was theirs and I don’t know if I should go buy it. I definitely don’t feel called to read Nash’s book, but this one I feel like I should. I just wanted people’s opinions on Lucian’s book so I can gauge if it’ll be a good one for me.

I’d love to feel like I’m following the narrator’s footsteps, going to the cities they go, hiking the same places, seeing the same sights, even if I’m going many years after and things will have changed significantly, that’s almost preferred. Likely nonfiction but fiction could work too. </p> <p>If anyone knows of literature that could be a useful travel guide I’d be so grateful to hear recs. Bonus points if there’s an element of Christian pilgrimage or a woman author. </p> <p>Overall, I’m looking for a cultural meditation in the vein of Sebald or Orwell. </p> <p>Cheers! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Interaction2487"> /u/Ok-Interaction2487 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>OK so, I have a request, please help! I need a fantasy/historical romance book with a fun and sunny ml that loves to flirt with the fl!! But I need him to be strong as well, like threatened you with a smirk on his face type. That&#39;s about it for the ml. Now for the fl I want someone who is strong but not overpowered, I don&#39;t want her to be like &quot;I&#39;m the best&quot; I want her to show through her actions that she is. I don&#39;t really care if she is more serious that the ml, what I do care about is for her to be a decent character. It would be a big plus if there was smut, BUT I NEEEED GOOD SEXUAL TENSION!!! I hope you have some recs for me, I&#39;m kinda tired of moraly grey male leads and a fl who says she&#39;s strong but excuses every action of the ml, because he is handsome 🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Human_Potential_9965"> /u/Human_Potential_9965 </a> <br/> <span><a hre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really enjoy good writing, and for some reason I enjoy specific authors more than others. For example, I love Nevil Shute’s writing - almost all of his books, except perhaps On The Beach, which many readers find very good, but which I found depressing (but still written very well!). Also John Harris, who wrote mostly books about World War II (readers who did some military service will appreciate his novel Up For Grabs as it the things he describe are so familiar. I enjoyed all of David Downing’s novels, especially the John Russell &amp; Effi Koenen series. Colin Dexter of course, who wrote Inspector Morse is a favourite, and the Australian author Marshall Browne’s Nazi auditor series is another. I also enjoy Hammond Innes (almost all his works) and some (not all) of the novels by Jack Higgins and Alistair Maclean. </p> <p>All of these are of course “older” writers (all passed away, no doubt). Louis L’Amour is the only Western writer I enjoy reading

## I really liked “Sometimes I lie”. Any other similar good books?
