<p>At <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-of-ces-2025-211535752.html">CES 2025</a>, NVIDIA introduced DLSS 4, the latest version of its real-time image upscaling technology, and announced that it will come to all RTX GPUs. That includes the RTX 20 series that was discontinued back in 2020, but the older models aren&#39;t getting all its features.</p>
<p>In the new GeForce RTX 50 series models, DLSS 4 will enable Multi Frame Generation. This feature will generate up to three additional frames for every traditionally rendered one, and it can help multiply frame rates by up to eight times more than traditional brute-force rendering. NVIDIA claims 4K 240 FPS fully ray-traced gaming will be possible thanks to Multiple Frame Generation when using its GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, the new $1,999 flagship GPU<a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidias-rtx-5090-graphics-card-costs-2000-031133416.html"> arriving later this month</a>.<

<p>Life for Sleepers is fraught. They gain consciousness in a state of indentured servitude, an emulated human mind inside an android body, forced to work until they’re discarded. Those who escape don’t last long due to trackers in their bodies, and their hardcoded dependence on a drug known as Stabilizer. Without it, a Sleeper’s body will eventually reject its biosynthetic organs.</p>

<p>Lenovo has a new series of updated Legion gaming laptops at<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2025/"> CES 2025</a>. The star of the show is the 10th-generation Legion Pro 7i. It supports up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, thanks to its cooling system that enables up to 250W thermal design power (TDP). It also has an AI engine that dynamically adjusts CPU and GPU wattage for optimal performance.</p>
<p>The 2025 Legion Pro 7i supports up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and the aforementioned RTX 5090 on the graphics side.

<p>It was an interesting year for robots at CES 2025. While we had hoped the AI boom would bring a new wave of useful robots to the show, it seems that many robotics companies are still figuring out exactly how to best use AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we found instead was a mix of adorable robot companions, strange concepts and one, slightly terrifying humanoid. We visited a lot of robots at CES and, for better or worse, some really left an impression on us. These are the ones that stood out the most.</p>

The Nintendo Switch <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-01-nintendo-switch-review.html">is over seven years old</a>, so it’s due for a refresh.

And it was while musing about the fate of those two storied — okay maybe not <em>storied</em> — names that I spied <em>another</em> Kodak booth two rows over. For a company that’s been dead more than a few times over, it’s certainly enjoying something of a renaissance. Look, it’s not as if there haven’t always been brands that die and get revived in pursuit of a quick buck. Especially if the price is cheap and there’s any residual degree of affection for it, but even so there are a hell of a lot of them now. Do we need four different companies selling Kodak-branded wares?&nbsp;</p>

<p>CES 2025 was a fantastic show for companies making good on the promises of years past. At these events, we’re used to seeing booth after booth of gadgets in concept and prototype phases, with vague details about final designs and release windows of “eventually.” This year, however, the vibe was way more release-ready. A handful of high-profile projects that debuted at previous CESes are back with concrete plans and actual release dates, and many of these products are available right now. It’s a veritable CES miracle.</p>

<p>It's always gratifying when something promised <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-of-ces-2025-211535752.html">at CES</a> actually comes to market.

I was able to see the final draft on the show floor this week and was adequately impressed. Like the (four!) other sustainable, electrified tiny homes we saw this year, it was shiny and luxe and decked out in wood tones, glass, metal and white polymers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The main features that drew us to the Flow last year remain intact: sleeping for four, a 45 kWh battery and a 1.1 kW solar pan

<p>There was no question that NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 5000 GPUs would be one of the biggest stories at CES 2025, and I figured Intel and AMD to arrive with some new hardware of their own. But I didn&#39;t expect that each of these companies would, in their own way, be putting the pedal to the metal when it comes to power for their chip designs. After all, we&#39;ve spent the last few years covering AI PC CPUs that was targeting efficiency more than raw performance.</p>
<p>While NVIDIA RTX 5000 GPUs seem to deliver the performance leap we expected over its 2022-era cards, AMD is also redefining what&#39;s possible for mobile workstations with its <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/amd-takes-ai-pcs-to-the-max-with-ryzen-ai-max-chips-194600366.html">Ryzen AI Max chips</a>, which combine powerful graphics with gobs of integrated memory.

<p>Small-scale, hyper-efficient living has always appealed to me, so I was overjoyed to step into numerous examples of sustainable tiny homes this week <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2025-updates-live-coverage-of-all-the-biggest-tech-ai-and-gadget-news-from-las-vegas-100003115.html">at CES 2025</a>. There were EV RVs, trailers geared for camping and deliverable, turn-key, self-sustaining living pods. I want one of each to create a little eco village somewhere, preferably within walking distance to a bakery, coffee shop and Thai food.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While none of these are cheap, some actually fall under what I would expect, compared to the market at large. And the suite of features employed represent some of the best sustainability capabilities available at the moment — solar power, gray water recycling, atmospheric water generation and boss-level insulation. Plus they're all very pretty.&nbsp;</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
