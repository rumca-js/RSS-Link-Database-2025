<p>Whenever I know I’m leaving my house for a while, I usually take a proper power bank with me. It gives me peace of mind, knowing that even if my phone battery dies, I’ll be able to recharge it anywhere.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a portable power bank, this is your chance to get one at a great price. Right now, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Charging-Battery/dp/B0CXDXP8VR/">high-capacity Anker power bank is on sale for just $45 on Amazon</a>, down from its $60 MSRP.</p>



<p>With a substantial capacity of 20,000mAh, this power bank is packed enough to charge your an iPhone 15 Pro four times or your MacBook Air a little more than one full time. And the 65W max single-port output is super fast, able to charge a phone over 50 percent in half an hour.</p>



<p>What’s great is that this power bank comes with a built-in USB-C cabl

<p>It’s always nice to kick back and vibe to your favorite music, but it’s even better when you have a quality speaker for the best sound.</p>



<p>It just so happens that the Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0D6WB7BV6/">is 25 percent off on Amazon right now</a>, meaning you can snag it for just $112 instead of its original $149 price. (Note that only the blue version is available for this price. The green, black, and tan options are on sale for just a bit more at $120.)</p>



<p>This Bluetooth speaker isn’t exactly tiny, but it’s far from massive. It’s just under 8 inches wide, 3.6 inches tall, and 2.1 inches thick, weighing 1.3 lbs. You can easily carry it around the yard, down the beach, or with you while you hike some trails. The nylon utility loop also makes

<p>Fast or tough? You can’t always have both, especially when you’re talking about electronics where “ruggedized” versions often come with compromises. But Seagate’s LaCie brand is aiming to offer both with its upcoming Rugged SSD Pro5 models, announced at CES 2025.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/new-lacie-rugged-ssd-pro5-offers-thunderbolt-5-storage-for-creative-pros-pr/">press release</a> and the <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/creative-pro/lacie-rugged-ssd-pro-5/">initial retail listing</a>, these 2TB and 4TB portable drives in LaCie’s familiar rugged, impact-resistant exteriors offers read speeds up to 6,700MB/s and write speeds up to 5,300MB/s. That’s assuming you’re using it with a compatible Thunderbolt 5 device, of course. And while it isn’t the fastest drive in the world, it’s probably the fast

<p>Sacked in the endzone? Down for the count? Struck out swinging? Go ahead and pick your favorite sport metaphor, but the bottom line is that Venu Sports is done. </p>



<p>In a joint statement, Venu Sports backers Disney, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they are dropping their plans for the ambitious streaming service, which would have bundled some of the most popular sports channels into a single—and somewhat pricey—package. </p>



<p>“After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,” the statement says, as <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/venu-canceled-disney-fox-warner-bros-discovery-1236271592/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by Variety</a>. </p>

<p>How much RAM do you need? It’s a common question, but one that doesn’t always have a straightforward answer. The Raspberry Pi, a cheap all-in-one system-on-a-chip for hobbyists, typically makes do with less RAM than conventional PCs, but a new 16GB version of the Pi 5 has come to give it a serious memory upgrade.</p>



<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of onboard DDR4 RAM is $120, more than double the price of the base 2GB model. (It’s also available in the original 4GB configuration for $60 and 8GB for $80.) But though that may sound pricey for a Raspberry Pi with no extra hardware, it’s reasonable considering the components. If we assume a $20 jump for every 4GB of memory, it lines right up. The new 16GB version is on sale right now at <a href="https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-5-16gb/">PiShop.us</a> and other vendors.</p>

<p>If you don’t know Shelly, you should. Extremely popular among hard-core smart home enthusiasts, the company introduced the <em>fourth</em> generation of its innovative smart home controls at CES this week.</p>



<p>What makes them different? Instead of supporting Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or Zigbee or Matter, the Shelly Gen 4 Series supports <em>all</em> those protocols. The user just needs to decide which one they want to use for their particular setup. And if you decide to switch to something different a few years down the line, you won’t have to start over with new hardware.</p>



<p>Many of Shelly’s lighting control products also <em>look</em> different. That’s because many of them are relays that mount inside the electrical box and behind your existing switches. When you wire the two parts together, you’re converting dumb switches and dimmers into smart sw

<p>The all-new Ecobee Essential smart thermostat Ecobee unveiled at CES this week delivers most of the features that we like about the higher-end Enhanced ($190) and Premium ($250) models, but at a much more wallet-friendly price of just $130.</p>



<p>With the Essential, Ecobee aims to simplify the path to smarter home temperature control for users who want comfort and convenience without overloading on complicated high-end features, such as radar motion detection and a display that streams video from Ecobee’s video doorbell and home security camera. </p>

<p>TP-Link’s Tapo smart home ecosystem gained a host of new products at CES 2025, including new home security cameras, smart lighting products—including a bona fide NVR system.</p>



<p>But if the recent stories about security flaws in TP-Link routers gives you pause, TP-Link assures us that there’s no longer any connection between it—TP-Link Systems—and China’s TP-Link Technologies. A TP-Link Systems spokesperson told us the company manufactures its products in Brazil and Vietnam, not China, and that it “owns its own factories, designs and manufactures its products, and controls its full supply chain.”</p>



<p>With that out of the way, let’s talk about the new Tapo products, starting with home security.</p>
