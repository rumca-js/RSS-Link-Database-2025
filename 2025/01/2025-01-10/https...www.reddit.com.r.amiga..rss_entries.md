## My mind is blown: you can use a Sega Master System controller on your Amiga, even with the rapid-fire dongle. How cool is that?

## After years in storage, I take out my Amiga and the mouse does not work. Why?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had my Amiga 1000 in a basement closet for 20 years or so. The closet is clean and dry. Everything worked when I put it away. Now years later I have nostalgia for this wonderful machine, and took it out and set it up only to find the mouse pointer does not move and is stuck in the top left corner of the screen. I tried both mouse ports, used contact cleaner on the port and mouse cable. I took the ball out of the mouse and the rollers are clean and move freely. Joy sticks work. What could have happened to the mouse just quietly sitting in a closet? Also tried different kickstart and workbench disks. I&#39;m sad about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Background-Use-4486"> /u/Background-Use-4486 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hyajgk/after_years_in_storage_i_take_out_my_amiga_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/
