<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>Flowers for AlgernonFlowers for Algernon</em> is an incredible read that I recommend to everyone. It‚Äôs the kind of book that sticks with you long after you‚Äôve finished it. That said, there‚Äôs one aspect of it that didn‚Äôt sit quite right with me, but overall, this is a must-read. I finished it in just two or three days, and if I didn‚Äôt have school or other obligations, I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve devoured it in one sitting.</p> <p>This was my first time reading <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>, though because of its popularity, I felt like I already knew quite a bit about it before picking it up. The book is often classified as science fiction, but I think anyone who enjoys fiction in general will get something meaningful out of it. It‚Äôs not science fiction in the traditional sense‚Äîno spaceships or aliens here. Personally, I love those kinds of stories, but I know they‚Äôre not for everyone. Regardless, don‚Äôt let the genre label deter you.</p> <p>What sets <em>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>The Silmarillion</em> is a book of stories that goes way back before <em>The Lord of The Rings Trilogy.</em> It gives us more information of the world that Tolkien created. And it is astounding. The book kept me hooked for days. It delves upon the creation of the Elves till the end of the Third World. </p> <p><em>The Silmarillion</em> talks about many books that came after this in summary. So, for all who wants to read any books of Tolkien after <em>The LOTR Trilogy and The Hobbit.</em> Do yourself a favour and read <em>The Silmarillion</em> before reading its successors or continuation. The action I unfortunately should have done. This book gives you summarized clarity about the other books. I mean the ones I read <em>The Fall of Gondolin</em> &amp; <em>The Children of H</em>√∫<em>rin.</em> Reading this book actually gave me the nostalgia of reading <em>The LOTR</em> series. You will never regret reading <em>The Silmarillion</em> even if you are

## Reading Rant: Introductions (usually to classic books) that spoil major plot points

I mean, come on! </p> <p>I think, when we read a book, normally, we follow a certain pattern. Open the book, and read the words in order.

She isn&#39;t as deep as she thinks she is either especially with that fig analogy.Also her being disappointed by her friends and the people around her while doing jack shit about it pisses me off.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was looking at some books yesterday and I noticed that on a few different series book 1 would be somewhat low rated or average and books 2-3 would be a fair bit better.</p> <p>Obviously this could be caused by the author gaining more experience in writing or just a better understanding of the story they&#39;re telling and the world they are building but I assume there is likely some bias involved also?</p> <p>If you rage book 1 poorly you&#39;re unlikely to continue the series but those who rated the book high are far more likely to continue the series and also enjoy it more.</p> <p>Is this something you take into when looking into whether you read a full series?

How chapter titles are formatted can affect the page numbers, as can potential illustrations, dedications, acknowledgements, etc etc. If you take 2 different books with roughly the same amount of pages but one could take way longer to read than the other. Eg: The Blood of Olympus by Rick Riordan and Fairy Tale by Stephen King are the exact same amount of pages but Fairy Tale takes nearly twice as long to read. So far the only thing I can think of is to go by audiobook length but even that can‚Äôt really be unified because different actors are going to read with different inflections and pacing.</p> <p>Basically I just want to know what‚Äôs truly the longest book I‚Äôve ever read ü§£</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cyclonecasey"> /u/cyclonecasey </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hy0tof/how_do_you_determine_the_tru

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Harper Lee transports the reader into the mundane beauty of <del>1960s</del> 1930s small town America. The story establishes the neighborhood so naturally, and the beautiful prose slowly pieces together a detailed painting of the fictional town.</p> <p>I particularly love how Scout often tells stories as a direct consequence of some event in her life. It&#39;s a wonderfully human way to explore the deeper knowledge behind her childlike curiosities. It also helps that Harper Lee&#39;s dry wit keeps many character descriptions amusing, and makes them come alive in the mind&#39;s eye.</p> <p>Speaking of the characters, I adore Scout and her family. The protective yet flighty Jem, the stoic yet comforting Atticus, and the intimidating yet warm Calpurnia establish just how important good role models are for a growing child. </p> <p>But what elevates To Kill a Mockingbird for me past a simple slice of life is how bluntly it pulls the rug from Scout and the
