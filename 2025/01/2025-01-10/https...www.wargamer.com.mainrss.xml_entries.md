								<p>Being a <strong>Pokémon TCG</strong> fan in 2025 is already proving to be a stressful experience.

And now, even normal sets aren't safe, as <strong>Pokémon Journey Together </strong>- which only released for pre-orders on Thursday - has <em>already</em> sold out at most retailers.</p>

								<p><strong>What are the best Warhammer 40k books?</strong> In the far future of the 41st millennium there is only war, but there's a <em>lot</em> of war, and that means countless tales to tell. Many superb sci-fi authors have written for this setting, from the classic Horus Heresy saga to brand new <strong>40k novels</strong>. Between us, the Wargamer team has read hundreds - so we can confidently say these are the best books and series for exploring Games Workshop's grim, dark future.</p>

								<p>My Curse of Strahd <strong>D&amp;D</strong> players have taken a lot of punishment lately. It didn’t surprise me, then, that they were reluctant to leap into another battle in our first session of the year. Spell slots were in short supply after a brutal crawl through Castle Ravenloft, and long rests looked unlikely. What <i>did</i> surprise me was the way they chose to cheese their way around combat – fishing zombies out of a room full of water, then blowing them up.</p>

								<p>Since JoyToy released its first licensed <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> action figures back in 2021, fans have been united behind a single dream - if you somehow had two armies of these massive figures, could you play a giant game of Warhammer with them? Warhammer fan Chris Tilley and his friends brought that dream to life at Illinois game store Fantasy Books and Games earlier this year, in a titanic showdown between the Ultramarines and Sons of Horus.</p>
