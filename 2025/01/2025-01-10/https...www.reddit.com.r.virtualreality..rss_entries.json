I don&#39;t mind turning some graphics down, but I fear that playing under 90fps will make me sick (never played VR before). As well as the resolution, that I don&#39;t fully understand what&#39;s confortable on VR. Anyway, here&#39;s my full setup, in case that matters, as well as some games I plan on gaming:</p> <p>RTX 3060 8GB I5 10400F 2x 8gb RAM</p> <p>Half Life Alyx Peaky Blinders VR A bunch of VR mods for non-vr games like fallout 4, firewatch, portal 2, skyrim.</p> <p>I appreciate the help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/renaio\"> /u/renaio </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hxyjyi/rtx_3060_8gb_vram_enough/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1hxyjyi/rtx_3060_8gb_vram_enough/\">[comments]</a></span>",
