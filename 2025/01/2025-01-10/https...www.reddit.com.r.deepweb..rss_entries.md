<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, I would like to try accessing the Deep Web or the dark web, but in fact, I&#39;m a complete noob. My question is: have you ever tried buying something from there? I&#39;m very curious and would like to try making a purchase (legal things) , even for just a few euros. Any reliable sites or general suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/East-Ad7697"> /u/East-Ad7697 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hy1wwb/dark_web_purchase/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hy1wwb/dark_web_purchase/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am just curious. How safe are forums like dread on the dark web? I have been to a few foruns and i have seen posts been taken down but is there a way to actually track the person behind the post if so, how? Security on the darkweb is gray area to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Different_Minute7372"> /u/Different_Minute7372 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hy0bdu/how_safe_is_posting_on_forums_on_the_darkweb/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1hy0bdu/how_safe_is_posting_on_forums_on_the_darkweb/">[comments]</a></span>
