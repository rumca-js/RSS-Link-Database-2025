President-elect Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out military action in his pledge for control of Greenland. Trump says the U.S. needs the island for “national security purposes,” but Greenland has been tied both politically and culturally with Denmark for decades. The Arctic island has vast deposits in rare earths, oil and gas, also making it a focal point for other rivals including China and Russia. But can Trump actually purchase the territory from Denmark?
