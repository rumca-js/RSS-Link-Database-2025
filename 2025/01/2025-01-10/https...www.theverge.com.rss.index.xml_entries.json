I\u2019ve sidled up to several booths where the glasses were almost carbon copy clones of the pairs a booth over. I\u2019ve seen all manner of \u201cdisplays\u201d tacked onto the lenses, ",

It\u2019s an impressive resurgence for a brand that many home theater enthusiasts remember for producing superb plasma sets back when those represented the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of display technology for the living room. After a long hiatus, Panasonic is back in the game and squaring off with Sony, LG, and Samsung in the <em>very</em> premium (and very pricey) TV category.</p>\n<p id=\"0cAA1z",
