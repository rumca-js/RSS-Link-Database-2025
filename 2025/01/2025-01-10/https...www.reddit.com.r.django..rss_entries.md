I have created a django specific AI to work as a mid level developer and I&#39;d like to get some feedback on it&#39;s performance &#39;in the wild&#39;.</p> <p>The easiest way to do this at the moment is for me to manage it and to let it have a branch of it&#39;s own (so it&#39;s easy for you to optionally ignore anything it does). I use OpenAI and I&#39;ll cover all the costs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I recently applied for a Django Developer position at Spotte (Spotter Labs). After passing an initial screening, I was told to complete a coding assessment with the promise of a $100 USD reward upon successful completion.</p> <p>Has anyone else done this task and actually moved forward in the process? Did you get paid and proceed to the next stage, or do you think this might be a scam? I know some might say &quot;why not try,&quot; but I’m really stressed with my current work and don’t have the time to invest in this. If I end up spending time on it and nothing comes of it, that would be pretty disappointing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/itsmefibi"> /u/itsmefibi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hy36cz/django_developer_job_at_spotter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1hy36cz/django_developer_job_at_s

PdfDing now has the following features:</p> <ul> <li>it is now possible to edit PDFs by adding annotations, highlighting and drawings</li> <li>you can organize your PDFs with multi-level tags as simple tags did not work for many people</li> <li>you can add markdown notes to store additional information about your PDFs</li> <li>there is now a live demo instance. You can try PdfDing <a href="https://demo.pdfding.com">here</a> without pulling the docker image.</li> <li>very soon you will be able to star and archive PDFs</li> </ul> <p>If you like PdfDing I would be really happy over a star on <a href="https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing">GitH

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Basic engineering question for anyone who has a second. What’s the best way to run long running / high memory task? I have an ffmpeg/moviepy service on google cloud run container (takes ~10m to run). I’ve tried: 1. From my web service, I’ve tried hitting cloud run endpoint directly [does not work because I need to return a response to client within reasonable time] 2. From my web service, I’ve tried using background worker [django-tasks] to hit cloud run endpoint which times out in 5m [but cloud run keeps running / not reliable] 3. From my web service, I’ve tried using google pub/sub framework to hit cloud run endpoint but given tasks take ~10m on average, the pub will retry every 10m until it’s a 200 msg which is acknowledged [not scalable given infinite retries]</p> <p>Anyone have any ideas to basically guarantee that my web service can execute/start a long running task</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https:
