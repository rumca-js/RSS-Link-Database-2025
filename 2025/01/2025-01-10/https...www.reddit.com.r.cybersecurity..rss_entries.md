<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have to choose one subject to specialise in for uni and I had some questions that would probably determine what I would enter. Firstly I came to this sub for 2 reasons one is that my account is too young to post in comp sci and also because until now I had my mind set on cyber because I wanted to become a cyber forensics investigator or Red team engineer / ethical hacker but I don’t have any clue what a cyber forensic investigator does or how their day looks like I have some minimal knowledge on what an ethical hacker does and what are skills needed. My long term goal is to have a sustainable business with good Income in a field I love, but my professors told me that cybersecurity is probably not the best are to entrepreneur in or start a business since it is already flooded with lots of firms.</p> <p>So here are my questions.</p> <p>1- Day in a life of cyber forensic investigator</p> <p>2- Skills needed to become a cyber forensic investigator</

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>curious if people dont mind sharing. we have a lot of things need doing that arent strictly cyber. Like patching, packaging apps, sorting out software licensing, chasing up lost devices, etc. Wondering how much this encroaches into other peoples jobs or if they are more pure threat hunting / IR, vuln management, or risk assessments? I dont mind doing it at all but my manager is conscious of me getting sidetracked (fair). But if we dont do it, there will often be more work for us to do to fix it.<br/> Im 3 years in cyber, fair bit longer in other areas of IT. mid size organisation. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sunshine_onmy_window"> /u/Sunshine_onmy_window </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hy188a/how_much_of_your_job_is_strictly_cyber_security/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hy188a/how_much_of_yo
