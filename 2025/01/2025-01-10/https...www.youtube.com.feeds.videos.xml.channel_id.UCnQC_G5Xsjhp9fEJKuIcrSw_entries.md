Ben discusses the LA Fire Department‚Äôs misprioritization of effective firefighting below the race and sexual identity of the firefighters. While the DEI and the fire department are a problem, it‚Äôs a tertiary problem compared to the rest of the list. At the top of that list is Gavin Newsom lying about the wildfire prevention efforts. He misrepresented his accomplishments and even disinvested in wildfire prevention by slashing the budget. He overstated the number of acres treated with fuel brakes and prescribed burns in the very forestry projects he said needed to be prioritized to protect the state‚Äôs most vulnerable communities.
