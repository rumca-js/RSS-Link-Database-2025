<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>OK been away for a long time (I mean long) back in the Townhouse and Newsbin days. Early to late 2000&#39;s. So I signed up for a few indexers all the same new shyte. I can get that from a search on my usenet provider (EN love them). Please help an old sole and help me find a forum that really goes beyond all this Woke shyte. Lord bring me home.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lounoobs"> /u/lounoobs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hxta50/ok_sick_and_tiredwhere_are_the_indexers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hxta50/ok_sick_and_tiredwhere_are_the_indexers/">[comments]</a></span>
