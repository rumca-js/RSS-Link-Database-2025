        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we\u2019ll do a deeper dive into the DEI program in the Los Angeles Fire Department. The Left insists that it has nothing to do with the catastrophe unfolding in LA right now\u2014but they\u2019re lying. Also, how many of these fires are being intentionally set? We\u2019ll talk about that. And, an OnlyFans hooker films herself propositioning a fast food worker. She humiliates herself in the process. Speaking of humiliating herself, Meghan Markle is back again with a new TV show. The audience reception has been unenthused, to put it mildly.\n\nEp.1512\n\n- - -\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - -\n\nDailyWire+:\n\nKick off 2025 with 25% off your new DailyWire+ annual membership.
