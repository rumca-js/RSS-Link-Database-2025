A great example is a favorite of mine, Stevie Wonder, who often uses complex jazz fusion harmonies, yet still has popular appeal. Another person I think of when it comes to songwriting is Bob Dylan, who made some songs that were topping the charts with memorable lines, then others that were bordering on obtuse, yet entertaining and thought-provoking.</p> <p>While there’s plenty of pop music I might consider bland, formulaic, or just simply lacking heart, I do in fact enjoy a lot of pop, especially from back in the day when raw talent was more on display in the studio.
