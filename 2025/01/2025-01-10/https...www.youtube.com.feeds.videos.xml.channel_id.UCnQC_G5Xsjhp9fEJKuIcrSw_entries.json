While the DEI and the fire department are a problem, it\u2019s a tertiary problem compared to the rest of the list. At the top of that list is Gavin Newsom lying about the wildfire prevention efforts. He misrepresented his accomplishments and even disinvested in wildfire prevention by slashing the budget. He overstated the number of acres treated with fuel brakes and prescribed burns in the very forestry projects he said needed to be prioritized to protect the state\u2019s most vulnerable communities. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Kick off 2025 with 25% off your new DailyWire+ annual membership.
