Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Gameplay Final Preview - Hands-On Impressions From the First 10 Hours!
In this Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 video, I'm going to be talking about my first impressions of playing the full version of the game. Thanks to Plaion and Warhorse, I got a copy of the game a few days and I've been able to play since then but I'm only able to give you guys my impressions from the first 8 to 10 hours of the game. So that's what this video is going to be and we will have a full review of the game later on. But for now, let's talk about what we think of the game so far
