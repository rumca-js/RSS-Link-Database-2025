This effort, using NASA's THEMIS dataset, will significantly enhance the prediction of geomagnetic storms, which can disrupt Earth's communication and security systems. Led by the University of New Hampshire, the AI-powered system categorised auroral images into six types, aiding in the efficient analysis of space weather events. This advancement enables more accurate studies of solar wind interactions with Earth's magnetosphere, offering a valuable resource for future research on space weather dynamics and their impact on Earth",

The artefacts, including crowns, rings, chains, and coffin plaques, were originally unearthed in 1931 but concealed in 1939 for safekeeping as World War II loomed. These treasures, associated with Alexander Jagiellon and two queens, provide a rare glimpse into Lithuania\u2019s rich historical and cultural past. Using an endoscopic camera, the regalia were found in an underground crypt.
