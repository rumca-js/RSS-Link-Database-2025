The researchers introduce a novel evaluation framework, RAG-Check, which measures the relevance and correctness of generated responses through two new metrics, the Relevancy Score (RS) and the Correctness Score (CS).</p> <p><strong>Key Points:</st

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This work proposes integrating instruction-tuned LLMs into end-to-end ASR systems to improve transcription quality without additional training. The key innovation is using zero-shot prompting to guide the LLM in correcting and formatting ASR output.</p> <p>Main technical points: - Two-stage pipeline: ASR output → LLM correction - Uses carefully engineered prompts to specify desired formatting - Tests multiple instruction strategies and LLM architectures - Evaluates on standard ASR benchmarks (LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM)</p> <p>Results show: - WER reduction of 5-15% relative to baseline ASR - Significant improvements in punctuation and formatting - Consistent performance across different speaking styles - Minimal latency impact when using smaller LLMs</p> <p>I think this approach could be particularly valuable for production ASR systems where collecting domain-specific training data is challenging. The zero-shot capabilities mean we could potentially adapt

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the hard line. Computationally, we are currently playing with the proof of concept, but it will not be able to meaningfully self train and have sufficient memory until it can process those things at speeds and costs that are multiple orders of magnitude better than today. Likewise, at neural network level, systems like o3 simply can&#39;t work in production with today&#39;s tech - it doesn&#39;t matter how good OpenAI are at optimizing the process, their current approach to smarten the LLMs needs unreasonable amounts of computational power if they keep using traditional chips.</p> <p>LLMs are a great candidate for quantum processing. The neural networks are fuzzy by nature anyway, just like it happens in our own brains. The next stage of this entire thing is to model neural networks into a probabilistic and fuzzy mechanism to match quantum processing. And when that happens, we will no longer be held back by prohibitive dataset size or high

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are so many doomsayers of AI and most of what they claim is hyperbole and sensationalism. I personally see AI as being a very useful tool for most people, though it is still FAR from being a significant boon yet. The current iterations of AI are just glorified autocorrect where, instead of replacing a single word, it can replace a prompt with a coherent exposition of indefinite length (and accuracy lol). Still cool, but nothing world changing. AI models&#39; ability to interpolate data, however, is already quite incredible. In particular, their ability to create video and images is impressive. Netflix has famously used AI to translate the language of movies and shows and have the mouths of the actors match the dubbed audio. The ability of AI to interpolate frames of a media content with slight alterations and have it appear genuine is very concerning. I am a TikTok enjoyer and I&#39;ve recently noticed a slew of videos that I&#39;ve seen before
