Now years later I have nostalgia for this wonderful machine, and took it out and set it up only to find the mouse pointer does not move and is stuck in the top left corner of the screen. I tried both mouse ports, used contact cleaner on the port and mouse cable. I took the ball out of the mouse and the rollers are clean and move freely. Joy sticks work. What could have happened to the mouse just quietly sitting in a closet? Also tried different kickstart and workbench disks. I&#39;m sad about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Background-Use-4486\"> /u/Background-Use-4486 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hyajgk/after_years_in_storage_i_take_out_my_amiga_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/",
