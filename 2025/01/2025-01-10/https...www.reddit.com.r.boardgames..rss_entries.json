I\u2019m trying to remember the details of a board game we used to play back in the mid 90\u2019s in the hopes that the hive mind can remind me of its name\u2026</p> <p>It was a c.3-4 player game on a square board with a monopoly style outer ring that you moved around in one direction with dice rolls. You collected cards with powers which allowed you to, for example, carry more items (that card may have been called the Cart of Plenty or something). Once you had collected something- perhaps specific objects? - you could move into the central tiles through a specific tile/gate in the outer ring and work your way around the inner ring. I think the end aim of the game may have been to get to the middle section and possibly fight some form of monster but I can\u2019t remember fully- not sure I ever got there!</p> <p>Can\u2019t see anything about this not being allowed, feel free to remove otherwise Mods.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
