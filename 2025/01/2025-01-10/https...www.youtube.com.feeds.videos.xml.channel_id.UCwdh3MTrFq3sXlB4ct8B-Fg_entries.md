The battlefields of Warhammer 40,000 are filled with varied landscapes and settings to choose from to base your armies! With the release of the new all-plastic Krieg, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to show you how to go about basing this new army, and theming it around their favourite battleground – muddy trenches! Follow Dan on his adventure into bulking up these bases using the leftover frames and bits from the kit, plus a few skulls for good measure!
