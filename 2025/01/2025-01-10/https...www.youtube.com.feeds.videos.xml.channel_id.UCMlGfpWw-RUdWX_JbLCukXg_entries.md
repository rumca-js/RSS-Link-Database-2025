Since our first popular Safety and Security panel at CppCon 2023, there has been a lot of development in ISO C++ in this space and in this panel we aim to give everyone a chance to ask the key authors questions on this development. There has been development in:

1. Profiles P2687r0 , P2816R0 , and P3038R0,: what is the main idea?

2. C++ Core Guidelines Concurrency and Parallelism sections: how will this improve C++ safety

3. MISRA C++ 2023 published based on C++ 17: what does it contain?

4. Contracts: how close are we? Will it be in 26?

5. SG23 Safety and Security and SG21 contracts

6. Safety/Security Blog post by Herb Sutter

Recent US government reports and media follow-ups have been numerous:
