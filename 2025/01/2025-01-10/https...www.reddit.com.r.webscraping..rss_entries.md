Right now this is a very manual, sometimes prohibitively time-consuming process.</p> <p>I’m picturing a browser plugin that when enabled can capture screenshots as you browse and ideally crop/stitch them together at least somewhat intelligently for an LLM to OCR, parse and tag into searchable text (the ability of some LLMs to not only OCR but get date/attribution for text based on a screenshot has been amazing to me in my tests. That way it would work for any platform you could view in your browser without playing whack-a-mole with anti-scraping technical measures from platforms. I understand this requires a human user who can access the pages manually so it wo
