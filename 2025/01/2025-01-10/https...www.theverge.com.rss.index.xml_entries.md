<p id="XQ0oJy">TikTok will be banned from the US unless either the Supreme Court blocks the law from taking effect before the January 19th deadline or its China-based parent company, ByteDance, finally agrees to sell it.

  <p id="EupjWK">The new CPUs, GPUs, and laptops announced at CES this week set the tone for Windows computers in the year to come — and so far, 2025 is looking pretty promising. There are a bunch of new notebooks I’m excited to test out when they come around, many of which are gaming-focused since the launch of Nvidia’s RTX 50-series cards is ushering in an onslaught of graphics-heavy refreshes and upgrades.</p>

  <p id="4KGOB5">Meta’s popular messaging app WhatsApp is testing a new design that gives prominent space to a suite of AI chatbots. The design, currently only accessible through the app’s Android beta, adds a dedicated tab for AIs on the app’s homescreen.</p>

  <p>At CES, the next generation of eyewear was everywhere. It’s just no one seems to agree on why we want it or what’s the best approach.</p> <p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8uPILD">It’s the second day of CES, and I’m waiting in a line to see my tenth pair of smart glasses. I honestly don’t know what to expect: I’ve seen glorified sunglasses with dubious ChatGPT clones. I’ve sidled up to several booths where the glasses were almost carbon copy clones of the pairs a booth over. I’ve seen all manner of “displays” tacked onto the lenses,

  <p>The company hasn’t been back in the US TV market for long, but the Z95B OLED proves that Panasonic can hang with Sony, LG, and Samsung at the very high end.</p> <p id="mK10Us">Panasonic returned to the US TV market last year, and only a matter of months later, I’ve convinced myself that its latest flagship OLED is the best TV of CES 2025. It’s an impressive resurgence for a brand that many home theater enthusiasts remember for producing superb plasma sets back when those represented the crème de la crème of display technology for the living room. After a long hiatus, Panasonic is back in the game and squaring off with Sony, LG, and Samsung in the <em>very</em> premium (and very pricey) TV category.</p>

After launching in August 2024, the Qualcomm chip had to sit and watch while the flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite came along two months later, drew more attention, and even launched in a Western phone first in the form of this week’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24336534/oneplus-13-review-specs-screen-camera-battery">OnePlus 13</a>.
