He has developed what he describes as a percolation model for word puzzles.",

The device utilizes a continuous-flow hydrolysis process, where cellobiose\u2014a disaccharide made from two glucose molecules\u2014is passed through a sulfonated carbon catalyst that is heated using microwaves. The subsequent chemical reaction breaks down cellobiose into glucose. Their results are published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.",
