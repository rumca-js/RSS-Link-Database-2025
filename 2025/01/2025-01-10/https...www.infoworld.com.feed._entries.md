<p>JavaScript runtime provider Deno Land’s efforts to get Oracle to yield the trademark for JavaScript have hit a snag, with Oracle refusing to voluntarily withdraw the trademark, Deno Land said.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/deno_land/status/1876728474666217739">Deno Land post on X</a> on January 7 provided an update about Deno Land’s continuing efforts to free up the trademark, which Oracle took ownership of when it purchased Sun Microsystems in 2009. “Oracle has informed us they won’t voluntarily withdraw their trademark on ‘JavaScript.’ Next: they’ll file their answer and we’ll start discovery to show how ‘JavaScript’ is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle.”</

<p>An emerging trend in cloud computing is using ephemeral environments for development and testing. Ephemeral environments are temporary, isolated spaces created for specific projects. They allow developers to swiftly spin up an environment, conduct testing, and then dismantle it once the task is complete.</p>



<p>Although proponents tout the benefits of this model—flexibility, cost savings, and improved efficiency—it’s essential to take a step back and critically evaluate its pragmatic value for enterprises. This is especially important at a time when the hype surrounding cloud-native technologies often clouds judgment, causing organizations to act impulsively.</p>

<p>Welcome to a new year of programming and the brand new monthly list of JavaScript stories just for developers! Among the highlights of this new year: Svelte and SvelteKit have seen a <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-new-in-svelte-january-2025">slew of incremental improvements</a>, <a href="https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/">Astro.js 5.0</a> just hit, and the Next.js team is working on a <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/composable-caching">composable caching mechanism</a>. </p>
