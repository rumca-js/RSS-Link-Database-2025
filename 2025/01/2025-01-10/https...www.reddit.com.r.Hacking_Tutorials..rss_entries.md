<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i just got my accounts hacked, nothing important, but a little stressing, and I&#39;m looking for answers as to how they might&#39;ve gotten to my accounts and what i found is that before i started getting e-mails about mi passwords changing, two services got connected to my Microsoft account, and these were: Thunderbird and Get Any Token. I know nothing about hacking and am just trying to see if you guys know if any of these are tools people use to get easy access to someone&#39;s accounts.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, </p> <p>I hope this is the right sub for my question. Iâ€™ve got a good chance for a career up in next weeks team lead meeting. </p> <p>What Iâ€™ve got to achieve is to up my bypassing skills. I have already got a working C# that fetches the msfvenom shellcode and creates a process (virtualalloc, marshal copy etc). For bigger engagements this code also needs to be working with defender etc enabled. </p> <p>What would we be good resources to fetch the information on how to get this working. Getting it working in 4 days would be great for the meeting. </p> <p>And what is causing the detection, known msfvenom shellcode or my C# stager?</p> <p>After spending 1400$+ on buying OSCP and not really going deep, Iâ€™d rather not do another course like this </p> <p>Iâ€™m sorry if this is a bit over the place, my head is pretty much scrambled from all the tries to getting it right in time. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www
