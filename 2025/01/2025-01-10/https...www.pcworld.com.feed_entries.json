The company says its all-new Wybot S3 can independently clean a pool for an entire month with <em>zero</em> human intervention, allowing you to all but forget about the tedious but essential task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wybot says the S3 will map your pool while it\u2019s underwater, which will then enable it to position itself precisely where it needs to be at any given time. During its initial cleaning session, the unit creates a detailed 3D map of the pool, enabling it to design the most efficient cleaning paths. This technology ensures comprehensive coverage of up to 3,229 square feet (300 square meters), tackling the floor, walls, and waterline with precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where many robotic pool cleaners must be pulled ",

Adam Patrick Murray cornered Nvidia\u2019s Senior Director of Products Justin Walker to talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walker says that Nvidia prioritized a smaller volume for the high-end card specifically to help it fit into smaller PC cases such as mini-ITX builds. They did this by organizing the airflow around the circuit board, shrinking the PCB to get fans on either side for more air volume without higher noise. It\u2019s also using secondary circuit ",
