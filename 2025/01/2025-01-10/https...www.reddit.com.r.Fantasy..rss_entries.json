The mod team has decided to put a pause on these posts for two weeks, for two reasons.</p> <p>The first is that these posts have required a great deal of work to moderate. They frequently descend into slapfights about Sanderson&#39;s prose, Sanderson&#39;s humor, and above all, Sanderson&#39;s LDS faith. They&#39;re all legitimate topics of discussion (within the bounds of Rule 1: Please Be Kind) but we&#39;ve had plenty of time since <em>Wind &amp; Truth</em> came out to talk about them.</p> <p>Second, <a href=\"https://sh.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/\">r/Fantasy</a> is a subreddit about fantasy and speculative fiction in general, and no one author should dominate. There are a number of large, active subreddits dedicated to Brando",

Just finished the book and figured I&#39;d quickly note my thoughts before reading your opinions. </p> <p>Great world, history ,current geopolitical situation and incredibly layered intricate plot. That being said , WHERE IS THE PERSONALITY ???. Ugh. Just read the book and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll forget the characters by tomorrow. It feels like they exist just to push the plot forward. The bits and pieces where they do get to have meaningful exchanges,( eg nitial Wirr-Davian scene, Asha descrbing her friends to the northwarden ) were done well and gave some depth. Overall, very lacking in this department </p> <p>This was not helped by the frantic pace of the book. Especially Asha&#39;s arc to becoming representative. The pace also means that all details are significant,Which makes it easy to guess some of the plot twists. ( Wirr, King controlled) </p> <p>I also felt there were a lot of instances where things work",

And I just know its going to break me. By the time I check this post again I will have probably finished the book as Im having a lot of trouble not picking it up every waking second im not busy. </p> <p>This is probably going to be my favorite book of all time, overtaking words of radiance and hero of ages.

However, in my experience, fans can often do more harm than good in getting new readers, and this is for two reasons:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>They Over-Recommend</strong> - You might think that recommending your book whenever possible is a good thing, but it can really be damaging. For example, if a person asks for an easy-going series and you recommend Malazan... you are setting them up to fail. Or if someone says they want a soft magic series and you recommend Sanderson anyway... they aren&#39;t going to like it. And the thing is that they possible COULD have liked it at another time--you just gave them false expectations. The key is to practice restrain and recommend only when it is truly relevant.</p></li> <li><p><strong>They Overhype</strong> - Again this has to do with expectations. If you say that",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m looking for recommendations for the best subscription service to read unlimited sci-fi and fantasy novels. I&#39;m specifically interested in reading in English. Some series I&#39;d love to check out are Red Rising, Stormlight Archive, Malazan Book of the Fallen, and Sun Eater. I&#39;m Japanese, and unfortunately these books haven&#39;t been translated into Japanese. I&#39;ve had some luck reading Chinese web novels with AI translation, and it made me realize I could probably tackle English novels this way too. However, buying a lot of individual ebooks on Amazon would get expensive, so I&#39;m hoping to find a good subscription service. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

The marketing around it was a lot lighter in tone and the ending really caught me off guard and isn&#39;t sticking with me in a particularly fun way right now.</p> <p>I got deeply engaging characters that I fell in love with, and definitely nothing at all like the progression and ending I&#39;d hoped for, and I don&#39;t have the emotional battery to keep reading knowing it&#39;s not concluded yet and the fates of the main characters aren&#39;t really decided. </p> <p>With that said, I&#39;m hoping for the same level of character depth and lighthearted banter with fun world building and conflict that builds up to a definitive romantic and happy conclusion, centered on lesbian characters in the fantasy genre specifically.</p> ",
