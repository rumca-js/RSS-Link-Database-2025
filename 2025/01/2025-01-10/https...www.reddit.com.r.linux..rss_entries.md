<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, in the past 10 years I built my first PC and later transitioned to Linux. While I did take to using it successfully, I discovered my ASROCK motherboard had firmware obsolescence, causing kernel logged errors for ACPI compatibility until I essentially disabled it in GRUB to move on (I&#39;ve tweaked some settings, but rather than &quot;cleaning the slate&quot; logs clog my boot drive, I&#39;d rather use it as is unless I distro-hop again). I&#39;ve looked up ASROCK on the net and found they consistently seem to develop Linux compatibility issues. </p> <p>Considering how rarely I build systems, I thought of this sub for advice. </p> <p>I want to do a fresh system build this year, as I also use an MSI Laptop with Linux that (aside from limited power) has no problems running, that functions without issues with Linux. Moving from virtual machines where I was doing labs with Linux to bare metal deployment has made me realize I want a machine that w
