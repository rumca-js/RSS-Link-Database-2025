Alexander Hartmann, a physicist at the University of Oldenburg, in Germany, has introduced a new model to explain a common word puzzle phenomenon. In his paper published in the journal Physical Review E, he suggests that instances where a puzzle solver experiences a sudden insight that allows them to begin finding solutions that seemed hidden are similar in some respects to the type of percolation seen when water percolating through a teabag suddenly makes its way out of the bottom of the bag. He has developed what he describes as a percolation model for word puzzles.

Researchers at Kyushu University have developed a device that combines a catalyst and microwave flow reaction to efficiently convert complex polysaccharides into simple monosaccharides. The device utilizes a continuous-flow hydrolysis process, where cellobiose—a disaccharide made from two glucose molecules—is passed through a sulfonated carbon catalyst that is heated using microwaves.

Active bubbles hold potential in fields ranging from water purification to medicine. Researchers can generate microbubbles by exposing liquids to high-intensity ultrasonic waves, a process known as sonication, and these energy waves heat up and pressurize the bubbles. For example, when bubbles in water are adiabatically collapsed by ultrasonic waves, the temperature inside the bubbles reaches more than several thousand degrees and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.
