<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my trusty TV is at the end of it&#39;s life. I bought it in 2006 I think. It was full hd, had 3 scart ports, 2 of this red/white/yellow triple things (sry don&#39;t know english word) and 3 hdmi ports. It had everything I needed. It played every console I have (NES, SNES, N64, PS2, PS3, Wii) and I was able to connect my steam link and my PC. And it was huge. And now it is gone. :-(</p> <p>So what do I buy? I absolutely do not want a smart TV. I just want a big flatscreen display that displays things. Nothing else. I don&#39;t think I want a curved monitor. And from a quick Google search I did not find a single TV with scart. So what do I do?</p> <p>This will also be the only TV in the house. What do you guys use to connect your consoles to? And where do I buy it? I live in Germany, so I have PAL consoles, if that still matters in 2025.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eyekona"> /u/eyekona </a>
