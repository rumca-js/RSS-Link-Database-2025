        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nNintendo is finally responding to all the recent leaks of the Nintendo Switch 2. This was likely brought on by the recent reveal of a mock-up of the Switch 2 at CES in Las Vegas by the accessory company, Genki. According to Nintendo, any leak is unofficial and not from reliable sources, but with so many details that seem to corroborate one another, we can't help but think that maybe\u2014MAYBE\u2014there's some truth to at least a few of these leaks. But only Nintendo can verify anything, and they've already said an announcement will be coming sometime this year. In other news, Marvel Rivals just got an update that not only added the Fantastic Four, but took away mod support. PC players will no longer be able to make Spider-Man look like Goku or use any other unapproved visual changes.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo",
