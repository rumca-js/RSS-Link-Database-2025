        "description": "Clickbait Title: Footprints in Stone III - The Reckoning\n\nBack in 2013 a couple random dudes decided to make a pseudo-sequel to Footprints in Stone called Forbidden History: Footprints in Stone II, which is essentially just an extended interview with Carl Baugh and his protegee Aaron Judkins. I was really tempted to call this video Footprints in Stone III, but restrained myself and consigned that in-joke to the clickbait title.\n\nProduced by Dan Olson\nWritten by Nathan Landel and Dan Olson\nAnimation by Megan Lloyd\nCamera by Kara Artym and Dan Olson\nEditing by Dan Olson and Nathan Landel\n\nBibliography: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiYlp7SJOcwttgnzJjaBv_3qO9XBay7K5B8aKTcK84Q/edit?usp=sharing\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman",
