But Postecoglou’s mind went back to his first job as a manager at South Melbourne and a make-or-break fixture in unusual conditions. It was an Oceania qualification tie for the inaugural 2000 Club World Cup and Postecoglou has vivid memories not only about what was at stake but also the surface at the stadium in Fiji.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/10/ange-postecoglou-toad-pitch-spurs-tamworth-fa-cup">Continue reading...</a>

With the city under lockdown, he took a job in a Covid lab at Gatwick Airport. “I was processing PCR tests for people who were travelling,” he says. “I didn’t know anyone in London except my boyfriend, but luckily the team I was working with were great.”</p><p>In June, they were joined by Christine, a biology graduate who lived in London and had transferred from the PCR testing lab at Heathrow. “When I arrived, they seemed like a tightknit team, so I was a bit anxious about fitting in,” she says. “But Brandon was super friendly and that drew me to him straight away.

<p>The crime novelist on the dark side of Dahl, the joy of Virginia Woolf and the comforts of Terry Pratchett</p><p><strong>My earliest reading memory<br></strong>An Andy Capp comic strip in my dad’s newspaper when I was six. It was about horse racing and my dad was watching horse racing on the telly. My brain just broke. Where did stories come from? Who wrote them? Why? Were they all about our family? Poor Dad. He just wanted to put a bet on, and I was pestering him about the nature of storytelling.</p><p><strong>My favourite book growing up<br></strong>My parents didn’t realise <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/roalddahl">Roald Dahl</a> wrote adult books, so I read some stuff I probably wasn’t ready for.

<p>The sand swirled, and cleared. A flash of gold appeared and my heart leapt</p><p>I was 10 when I went on my first archaeological dig. I’d been exploring a clay pit near Bletchley Park, Milton Keynes, where I grew up, and found the fossilised jawbone of a small ichthyosaurus, complete with tiny teeth. I took it to a&nbsp;local geologist – he was amazed at what I’d found and put me in touch with an archaeologist in Buckinghamshire, who took me to a dig site. I found a bucket full of historical items in a spoil heap. From&nbsp;then on, I went to dig sites every&nbsp;weekend.</p><p>I like to work with my hands, so&nbsp;pursued a career as a brick- and stonemason; I even taught the trade in&nbsp;a college for three years. In 1984, I&nbsp;was working as a builder when a&nbsp;former student invited me to try scuba diving. It was exciting being able to see underwater.

<p>I loved to scour apps and charity shops for cheap clothes and toys – but now I know it is another kind of overconsumption</p><p>‘Guess how much this was,” I say to my partner mischievously, revealing with relish the latest toy I’ve found for our youngest son. It’s wooden, Montessori in style (apparently a ball dropping through a hole teaches him object permanence), and retails at about £20 new. “A quid,” my partner proffers, wearily: he is savvy to this game by now. This time, though, I can go one better. “Free!” I screech with glee. “Free! Can you believe that? Someone was giving it away on that secondhand WhatApp group.” I’m giddy with my find, drunk on the size of the bargain, but, as I add the new (to me) toy to the teetering pile of others – dolls, a tunnel, toy cars, a lunchbox – I can feel something – guilt, I think – gnawing away at me.
