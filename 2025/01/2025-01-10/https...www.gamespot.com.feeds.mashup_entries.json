Preorders are now open for Jujutsu Kaisen: Season Two. This will be released in several editions, starting with a standard $35.70 (was $40) Blu-ray that covers the Hidden Inventory and Premature Death arcs. This will be released on February 4, but if you're only interested in the Shibuya Icident saga, there'll be a standalone Blu-ray release as well as a collector's edition arriving on March 18.</p><div title=\"6528734 - Jujutsu Kaisen Season two\" data-embed-type=\"buylink\" data-ref-id=\"3049\" data-template=\"4\" data-size=\"buylink__listicle\" data-title=\"6528734 - Jujutsu Kaisen Season two\" data-collection=\"\" class=\"norewrite\">  <div class=\"buylink-container\">                                                                     <div class=\"js-buylink-item-container buylink-item-container\">             <h2 class=\"item-title\">            ",
