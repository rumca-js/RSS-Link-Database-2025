Now, I\u2019m going back to true Linux: NixOS. I've never used NixOS, but I've heard great things about it and it seems super interesting so figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nIn this video, I'm putting together a Dual PC setup: one with NixOS for coding and the other with Windows (i know i know, but i need it for content and gaming), and I'll be using a capture card to get the NixOS video feed over to my content machine. Then, I get NixOS installed and configured with the following (parenthesis list the lang each tool is written in):\n\nOS: NixOS (Nix)\nWM: Hyprland (C++)\nBar: Waybar (written in C++).
