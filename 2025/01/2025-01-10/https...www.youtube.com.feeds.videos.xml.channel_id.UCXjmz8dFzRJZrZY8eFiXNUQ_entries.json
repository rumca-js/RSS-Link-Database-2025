        "description": "When it was first announced that The Fast and Furious franchise was getting a spin-off in Hobbs and Shaw, most Fast fans had the same thought....\"Do we really need this?\"  Although not the lowest point in the Fast and Furious franchise, it's still seen as a massive cash grab in order to boos the ego of one of the casts new stars, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.  If it weren't for the very public feud between The Rock and Vin Diesel, Hobbs and Shaw may never have gotten made.  Yet, Universal pushed forward with a forced Fast and Furious spin-off, that most fans hardly remember. \n\n#fastandfurious #hobbsandshaw #dwaynejohnson #vindiesel",
