I\u2019ve set up a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W running PiHole (works great, would highly recommend), NoIp DUC (also works great, I can see my router\u2019s IP when I put in the DDNS address), and PiVPN (why I\u2019m here).</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried both OpenVPN and Wireguard. In both cases, I\u2019m unable to get any clients to connect to VPN. I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down to a port forwarding issue. I\u2019ve selected \u201ccustom\u201d as the forwarding type on the router, the Pi as the client, put in the UDP port that I\u2019ve selected for VPN and\u2026nothing.
