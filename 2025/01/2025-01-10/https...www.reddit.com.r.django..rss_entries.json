As they are now implemented I just wanted to do a quick follow up post. PdfDing now has the following features:</p> <ul> <li>it is now possible to edit PDFs by adding annotations, highlighting and drawings</li> <li>you can organize your PDFs with multi-level tags as simple tags did not work for many people</li> <li>you can add markdown notes to store additional information about your PDFs</li> <li>there is now a live demo instance. You can try PdfDing <a href=\"https://demo.pdfding.com\">here</a> without pulling the docker image.</li> <li>very soon you will be able to star and archive PDFs</li> </ul> <p>If you like PdfDing I would be really happy over a star on <a href=\"https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing\">GitH",
