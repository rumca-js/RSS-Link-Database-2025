And what is annoying me about that is that i want to update everything that is exposed frequently because of security. Now i don&#39;t wanna build the container every time manually when an update is out. </p> <p>I looked at traefik but that just seems to make everything more complex for me therefor i didn&#39;t want to bother about that to much.</p> <p>Does anyone face the same dilemma or has an idea how to overcome this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",

I&#39;m looking to get some help when turning my current &quot;server&quot; pc from w11 to something like unraid or proxmox, haven&#39;t done the proper research yet on which would fit me best but would probably prefer not to spend $200 on unraid.</p> <p>I have 2x 4TB hardrives of pictures and videos etc and then a m.2 ssd for the OS. I&#39;m mostly looking to keep hosting my plex server and then also set up other things like a password manager and picture backup. I also want VPN to run on certain things. </p> <p>Would i have to lose all my data on the hard rives when swapping OS? Id really prefer not to lose everything or have to move them to a temp drive etc. I had this issue when going from ubuntu to windows at one point and that was annoying..</p> <p>Also any tips for what would be best for me would also be appreciated.
