<p>A high-budget series set in the Outer Hebrides – it’s hard to believe it’s taken this long, given how popular subtitled TV is. It’s a good, solid series, even if the plot stretches credulity</p><p>It is difficult to imagine An t-Eilean being made even 10 years ago. It is billed as the UK’s first ever “high-end” Gaelic drama series, which means, I think, that it was expensive to make (a report last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/apr/13/an-t-eilean-outer-hebrides-drama-scots-gaelic">put it at £1m</a> for each of its four episodes). The title translates as The Island, and it is set mostly on the Western Isles, which makes it breathtakingly beautiful and means that everyone is in possession of a good solid coat. An t-Eilean exists thanks to renewed interest in and support for the speaking of Gaelic and, with subtitles no longer being seen as a barrier to enjoyment, has a strong shot at winning over an audience far larger than the 60,000 or so fluent speakers in

However, García rejoined the DP World Tour in November, paying around £1m in fines, in a bid to make a dramatic Ryder Cup return at Bethpage. According to Rahm, his fellow Spaniard is still one of Europe’s top dozen players.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/jon-rahm-sergio-garcia-ryder-cup-impact-liv-golf">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stuart Gatt’s adventurous debut pitches meathead Clyde and his downtrodden wife Geena against city-dwelling newcomers Andy and Amaya</p><p>British director Stuart Gatt’s confidently handled debut is a tale of two trailers: one a banged-up redneck bolthole in a godforsaken Texas desert commune; the other the minimalist glamping palace opposite. Taciturn meathead Clyde (Jai Courtney) occupies the former with his downtrodden wife, Geena (Erin Moriarty), and is none too pleased when vacationing New Yorkers Andy (Ryan Corr) and Amaya (Dina Shihabi) pitch up. Not just because their swanky digs are ridiculously out of place, but because their presence might draw attention to what he’s doing out there in the first place.</p><p>Where many foreign directors come a cropper trying to show fealty to classic American iconography, Gatt has the confidence to do his own thing – kicking this off as a cagey town and country comedy of manners. The urbanites upend Clyde’s established order with deluxe

After all, it has been said, a Dutch team needs a Dutch coach.</p><p>Of the starting XI who defeated Saudi Arabia in a November World Cup qualifier in Jakarta, eight were born in the Netherlands and more are coming.

When the two went face-to-face, it felt as if the victor was guaranteed success.</p><p>Liverpool have maintained their place at the top tables in England and Europe, whereas Forest’s journey has been more storied, the club dropping to the third tier before making it back to the top flight after almost a quarter of a century away. Now the pair are rivals for trophies again; Liverpool travel to the City Ground on Tuesday at the top of the pile and, much to almost everyone’s surprise, Forest are only two places below and dreaming of reliving the glory days.
