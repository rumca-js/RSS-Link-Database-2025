<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I request naked/nsfw mod for JRPG Trials of Mana to be ported to android version. I&#39;M WILLING TO PAY AT LEAST $20-30 to anyone who able to do it.</p> <p>Why? Because Trials of Mana android version is quite different. It has very different packaging file and its directories, making modding seemed impossible without programming knowledge on how to decrypt .pak / UE4 game engine files in android.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blas7hatVGA"> /u/Blas7hatVGA </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i1dyak/trials_of_mana_jrpg_naked_android_version_modding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1i1dyak/trials_of_mana_jrpg_naked_android_version_modding/">[comments]</a></span>
