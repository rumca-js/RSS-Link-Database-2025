  <p id="k0DxcP">Instead of wallowing in misery about potentially losing access to their favorite short-form video app, many TikTokers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342986/rednote-xiaohongshu-chinese-social-media-app-tiktok-ban">are flocking to RedNote</a>, a Chinese social media platform also called Xiaohongshu. I’ve decided to spend some time on the platform myself, and it looks like so-called “TikTok refugees” are excited about interacting with a community mainly comprised of Chinese-speaking users — and vice versa.</p>

  <p>Some YouTubers say Honey’s practices are stealing money from them.</p> <p id="5MnAb5">PayPal’s Honey browser extension has been lauded for years as an easy way to find coupons online. But some are calling it a “scam” after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk">a deep dive</a> from YouTuber MegaLag, who accused Honey of “stealing money from influencers.”</p>
<p id="pE4tpS">The video shines a light on Honey’s use of last-click attribution, an approach to online shopping referrals that gives credit for a sale to the owner of the last affiliate cookie in line before checkout. As MegaLag’s video tells it, Honey takes that cr

Some employees have told me that Bouvat-Merlin shares a significant amount of blame for the brand damage that Sonos has endured over the last year after deciding to release an overhauled mobile app well before it was ready for customers.

  <p id="7dZIY7">For a game about collecting bananas and throwing barrels,<em> Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> is surprisingly inventive. The game, which originally launched on the Wii in 2010, takes the classic SNES side-scroller and steadily infuses it with new ideas, creating an experience that’s at times both tense and thrilling. You’ll do everything from fly a rocket through bat-filled caves to avoid the tentacles of a giant squid. It gets <em>intense</em>. It’s also a game that’s known for being very hard. But a new port on the Switch makes it slightly easier to enjoy all of those thrills without getting too frustrated.</p>
