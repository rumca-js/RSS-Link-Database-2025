As the silicon valley driven "AI" development cycle continues at full speed, i wanted to discuss one of the more immediate impacts that can be seen emerging for everyday users, despite the factt hat they may choose to never use or interact with the software themselves.

With an over 4000% increase in malicious emails since the advent of chatGPT, I want to take a look at the concept of spear phishing, and talk about how low cost, high yield targetted and custom built phishing campaigns are one of the more alarming applications for current AI models.

Eliminating the barrier of entry, and allowing unlimited expert level social engineering attacks (as the paper in this video will show)... is a hairs breadth away from widespread online disaster.
