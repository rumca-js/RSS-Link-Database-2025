<p>Nick Wingfield, writing today’s The Briefing column for the paywalled (alas) The Information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sonos has always been a bit of an odd duck. There aren’t that many
consumer electronics startups of its size created in the last
quarter century (Sonos was founded in 2002) that have survived as
independent companies. Its products are expensive relative to the
wireless speakers that have flooded the market from big-name tech
rivals like Amazon and no-name competitors from China. And yet,
Sonos held on partly because it had a commitment to high-quality
sound and an Apple-like dedication to user experience, both of
which gave it a passionate fan base.</p>

<p>The events of the last year seem to have ruptured that
relationship with many of its customers. Today, Spence’s
replacement — Tom Conrad, a Sonos board member, who is now
interim CEO — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342354/sonos-interim-ceo-tom-conrad-employee-letter">reportedly told staff</a> he’s

<p>Mike Davidson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I grew up on Iliff Street, right in the middle of the ashes that
up until a few nights ago, was a sunkissed neighborhood known as
Pacific Palisades.</p>

<p>It was 1978, and I remember my dad climbing up on our roof with a
garden hose. Every couple of hours, he would wet the house down,
top-to-bottom, and everything surrounding it. I don’t remember
everybody doing this, but my Dad is a Meteorologist, and back then
he worked at the <a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/">SCAQMD</a>, the regional agency charged with
studying, regulating, and improving air quality in Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Because of his
specific remit and where we lived, he had a deep understanding of
the Santa Ana winds and their effect on the Palisades.</p>

<p>When my dad explained what he was doing, he would point northeast
to the hills behind us and tell us that if the winds didn’t die
down, the fire miles in the distance would come towards our t

## Volume 1 of Jack Smith’s Special Counsel Report Flatly States Trump Would Have Been Convicted in Election Case

<p>Alan Feuer and Charlie Savage, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted President-elect
Donald J. Trump on charges of illegally seeking to cling to power
after losing the 2020 election, said in a final report released
early Tuesday that the evidence would have been sufficient to
convict Mr. Trump in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not
made it impossible for the prosecution to continue.</p>

<p>“The department’s view that the Constitution prohibits the
continued indictment and prosecution of a president is
categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes
charged, the strength of the government’s proof or the merits of
the prosecution, which the office stands fully behind,” Mr.
Smith wrote.</p>

<p>He continued: “Indeed, but for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent
return to the presidency, the office assessed that the
admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a
conviction at trial.”</p>

## Bananas Bloomberg Report: ‘China Weighs Sale of TikTok’s US Operations to Elon Musk’

<p>No byline, which is really weird, just “Bloomberg News”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here’s Todd Spangler, reporting (with his name) for Variety:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TikTok denied a report that China is looking at potentially facilitating a sale of the app to tech billionaire Elon Musk to keep TikTok operational in America amid a looming U.S. government ban.</p>

<p>“We can’t be expected to comment on pure fiction,” a TikTok rep said in reply to Variety‘s request for comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be no one is wrong here. Maybe ByteDance’s owners, the Chinese government, know what’s going on, and the dupes at TikTok don’t.</p>
