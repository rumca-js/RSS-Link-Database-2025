<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello</p> <p>I&#39;m in data governance and looking for a cybersecurity perspective. At my workplace, a project team want to publish online a Google Doc with settings that allow anyone on the internet to Comment, for stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>From a data governance perspective this is ok because the project document has no data that is sensitive, confidential, personally identifiable etc. It is just a high-level summary of things that are already in the public domain. Also Google Docs masks the identity of viewers or Commenters (unless they give it their consent to use their named Google accounts), so there is no issue with data breaches around anyone on the internet who might view the doc or add a Comment to it.</p> <p>But someone has asked whether there could be a cybersecurity risk to the organisation.</p> <p>Does this seem plausible to anyone here? If so, what would the risk be? And is there anything we can do to prevent or mitigate it?</p>

Like I can google things and research but absolutely nothing else. I just feel stupid when asked about my school goals. I feel like an imposter. I’m just showing up like here I am. I never ever imagined this for myself. I was in school a looooong while ago, got an associates in Criminal Justice and went back for a Biology degree. I thought I would do something related to forensics or something since those two can work together. I was almost ready to transfer to a 4 year when life happened. Now many moons later, I’m here. It sounded cool and fun and, bonus, I might have an “in” when all is said and done. </p> <p>Anyways, what’s been your experience? How did you get to this field? </p> <p>Ps. Don’t come for me.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve put off taking the sec+ because of this. I feel like there’s so much I still don’t know, like I just feel completely inadequate and overwhelmed sometimes. I worry the minute I start the exam I’m going to go into panic mode and forget everything I know. I went through the google cybersecurity cert and felt on top of the world for just a minute because despite having very little technical or security background, I breezed through it. Then, I quickly got hit hard with the actual reality that the security+ is so much more than that. I’ve been watching professor messor’s videos, I have multiple notebooks full of notes. I’ve made notecards and I’ve tried every official Comptia security+ study prep book I could find. Friends in the field consistently tell me I’m ready and I should just go for it but the thought of actually taking the test just immediately nauseates me. I have no idea how to feel prepared “enough” for it. I’m mostly scoring around 80-85
