## What trackers are better long term?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to decide which one gives the best tracking for the price.</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently been looking into full-body tracking (FBT) and found SlimeVR and Mocopi. They seem like good options, and I learned you can combine them for a better overall experience.</p> <p>A lot of people also recommend using three Vive 3.0 trackers with two base stations. It&#39;s a more standard setup, but I’m trying to figure out which option is better overall.</p> <p>If I go with SlimeVR and Mocopi, it’ll cost about $1,200–$1,300 AUD. That includes a full-body set from SlimeVR and the default Mocopi trackers. On the other hand, the Vive setup with three 3.0 trackers and two base stations (not sure what versions they are as it hasn&#39;t got a number) costs around $1,117 AUD total.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Budget_Bit5697"> /u/Budget_Bit5697 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality

No issues, but base skyrim no mods is pretty lame.</p> <p>I started with Mad Gods VR modpack. After a day of tinkering but inevitably only getting 36 fps (likely due to ASW, i think? dam idk) i eventually switched to FUS cause I just wanted to play already.</p> <p>Before installing Skyrim FUS modpack, i completely wiped my pc. Bootloader USB, wiped everything.</p> <p>Installed FUS. I am using the most graphically modded version of FUS, but even so, its still pretty lightweight compared to Mad Gods. Framerate is a little better, but im still getting alot of frame drops, and i have to use open composite to even be somewhat stable.
