<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back when I was 5, I used to have a third party fake Gameboy console which had many games (including both Nintendo and SEGA). There was this 16/8 bit platformer game which had a subterranean setting (maybe a sewer?) with a bluish background and featured large mutated two legged rat. That&#39;s all I can remember about it. I lost that console many years ago and don&#39;t remember the title of that game. Can anyone here please help me finding it?

## Reason for the NES "rituals"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Any of us who had an original NES knows the ritual of having to blow on the cartridges, press the Pwr and Reset buttons together, power off/on the device, or slide the cartridge just far enough in to press it down where it sounds like you&#39;re breaking the machine. It was practically a meme in 80s before memes were a thing.</p> <p>Now that I&#39;m older, I&#39;m curious to know – from a technical point – if anyone knows why we had to do those &quot;rituals&quot;? Has anyone figured out where the loose connections were or what was causing the cartridges to not work until the third or fourth try? Was the NES just poorly designed? It was interesting that so many of us experienced the same issues. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TollyVonTheDruth"> /u/TollyVonTheDruth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i0uo00/reason_for_the_nes_rituals/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

The graphics are definitely plain, but you can use 3 different forms and a plethora of weapons.<br/> I assume nobody else has heard of this game, much less played it.

It was a defining moment for several genres like JRPGs, RTS, 3D Fighting and Racing, and Adventure, and a year with groundbreaking if not always well aged visuals and storytelling techniques. It also lends itself to some reflection on the challenges that came with technological advances and market fragmentation, since these stood in stark contrast to growing customer confusion, frustrating hardware limitations, and sometimes unfu
