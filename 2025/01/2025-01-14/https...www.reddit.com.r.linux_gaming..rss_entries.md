I had the pleasure of getting Ori and the Blind Forest recently. I bought the GoG version as I don&#39;t like Steam as much. I&#39;m a Linux (Manjaro) user: From what I see Ori never got a native Linux version, which is sad as Linux users are still left behind... curious if anyone managed a third-party port of the engine, if so please let me know how I can find it. Thankfully it does run using WINE without massive issues, both audio and video are smooth without errors or noticeable performance loss.</p> <p>There&#39;s just one problem I&#39;m encountering and don&#39;t know how to fix, likely related to WINE: All sounds are delayed by an entire second or more. For any action that happens in the world, it takes +1 seconds to hear it. It&#39;s bearable but feels wrong. If there&#39;s a way I&#39;d like to fix this.</p> <p>I was wondering if anyone

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, since I was 13 I wanted a powerful custom built PC to game and 3D model/animate with. I&#39;m now 20 and got a job, so I&#39;m finally able to get one, but the problem is: I actually don&#39;t know how to move.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t followed the new updates since then and I became ignorant of the subject. </p> <p>Since I wanted to keep Linux as OS (I&#39;m pretty new to this and I&#39;m currently using Linux Mint as starting point), I got recommend by a colleague to use AMD processors and graphic card. For now I bought &quot;AMD Ryzen 7 5800X&quot; since it was 62% off on Amazon and I still have 2 weeks to make the return in case it wasn&#39;t a good idea (same thing for the SSD &quot;Samsung 980 PRO&quot;: 32% off). But for the rest of the components I need a very big hand by you all. </p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of a medium-high performance since the programs that I want to run will be pretty heavy, so what are your recommendations?</p> <p>Thank you

I tried messing with all the in game settings but nothing fixed it except enabling ray traced shadows which tanks the FPS. I did not find any solutions on Google or ProtonDB either.

There&#39;s no point in spending money on features one doesn&#39;t need or use.</p> <p>Seeing some of the debate in other threads recently, there&#39;s a very good reason why these technologies exist. HDR and VRR aren&#39;t marketing catch phrases. Sure, the features may be attached to products that don&#39;t support them well, but that&#39;s the product, not the fundamental tech itself.</p> <p>I had several HDR non-OLED monitors, VA and IPS based. HDR could be cool but not impressively. Then I got the Asus PG42UQ and then an LG 27GS95QE. Beyond impressed. Night and day difference between the non-OLEDs. As long as I can afford it, I&#39;ll never buy another monitor without these features. These are the two best monitors I&#39;ve ever owned.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, this is the first time I&#39;m posting in this subreddit. I&#39;m wanting to compile the proton-8.0.4 version, which I&#39;ve got directly from valve&#39;s GitHub. I&#39;m needing this particular version due to the mono support version that&#39;s included. I thought I could get away with moving the folder into the compatibilitytools folder, within .steam/root/. But steam doesn&#39;t seem to display this version under forced compatibility options. </p> <p>Now I know there&#39;s GE versions out there. But none that I could find, that support this particular version of mono support. </p> <p>Do any of you know what&#39;s needed in order for steam to show that proton version? </p> <p>I am running steamos through my steam deck. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Drawing4232"> /u/No-Drawing4232 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i0uer0/compile_proton804/">[lin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A little basic info about me. I use Linux (arch btw). I use multiple monitors (3 when possible). I like to play a lot of different games, from triple a, to esports games and old classic games. I also do a lot of stuff like video editing, 3d modeling, illustration, and music production. And I dabble in Al stuff every now and then. I want my system to be able to do everything, not just gaming. I have a decent amount of knowledge about PCs and such, but I&#39;ve never built one from scratch with expensive parts, so I&#39;m really nervous about it and want to make sure I don&#39;t forget something important or make a stupid decision. Oh, and I don&#39;t care about aesthetics at all. I only care about performance and reliability. Reliability is very important to me.</p> <p>My pcpartpicker list: <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rswLyW">https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rswLyW</a></p> <p>I will give my motivation for the chosen parts.</p> <p>CPU: Ryzen 9
