<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Watched <em>The Substance</em> recently and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how &quot;punk&quot; it felt. Like, not subtle, stylish, in your face, exciting kinetic movement and interesting angles. I&#39;ve started to try and figure out similar feeling movies, not necessarily similar subject matter, just that feeling of someone just going for it, they have a vision and are having a blast putting it on screen. Not necessarily Crank/EEAAO which are very stylish and in your face, but to me feel a bit random for the sake of random. Reservoir Dogs, Lock Stock, Trainspotting, Brazil, Love Lies Bleeding come to mind, any other suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gagreel"> /u/gagreel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i1gxii/punk_feeling_movies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i1gxii/punk_feeling_movies/">[commen

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Had a bit of a random thought today, military nicknames, and air force call signs, are usually given out due to some embarrassing or funny moment in the bearers life while they were in training, no matter how cool it sounds to someone who doesn&#39;t know about it. So, considering the classic film Top Gun had such cool call signs, I want to know what people think the backstories might have been for them. I&#39;ve only really got two, and one is pretty easy. Goose got his name from an assignment to clear some aforementioned birds from a runway, and had a difficult time or an altercation with one. Ice Man... probably got stuck in a freezer for awhile doing something stupid, or just grabbing too much stuff when there isn&#39;t a handle on the inside of the door. So, any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Drivestort"> /u/Drivestort </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Black Cauldron is a vert artistic and unique film. Many critics found the film to be too dark and cynical for a &quot;children&#39;s movie.&quot; Based on The Chronicles of Prydain, the story follows shepherd Taran as he seeks to restore order and stop the evil Horned King.</p> <p>There are some ill-advised choices I wish The Black Cauldron had avoided like the annoying sidekick, Gurgi, who sounds like a Teletubbie, but overall, it&#39;s a enjoyable animated Epic. </p> <p>It wasn&#39;t as bold as anything Don Bluth did in that decade but it was attempt to go in that direction and I do think, had Don Bluth stayed on, the film might have found the right balance to win over a greater audience. Instead, it was a huge flop and was stuck with a negative label ever since.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lionel_Hislop"> /u/Lionel_Hislop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/commen

Even though there was a drop in quality once Guttenberg left, it was still a fun series that knew when to be silly and when to hit proper social commentary. </p> <p>For example: I love how HighTower protects Hooks in the first movie when the instructor calls her a racial slur. While the flipping the car over may be played for laughs, it is still a great scene of HighTower protecting his buddy from a racist rant. Not to mention the movies really show Positive Masculinity between the characters.</p> <p>Like, no one makes fun of Tackleberry when he admits to being a virgin at his age. In fact, they all support him and act as his wingmen. All the guy (protagonist) characters love and support one another and any teasing is just good natured fun and never cruel. </p> <p>I also think it is in that Russia movie where the (usually antagonistic) Lassarad procla

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Vernita’s seemed to be knives, Oren the katana , and was also an excellent sharpshooter. Elle, Budd and Bill didn’t seem very specialized to me. To me, Beatrix always seemed to be the best hand to hand fighter. She was Pai Mei’s best student, and kungfu instructor so it would make sense pure physical fighting with bare hands would be her best skill set. Though she really loved blade work with a katana , and was skilled enough to defeat Oren. Thoughts? Extra: do you think Vernita would have won that knife fight? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bolwonder"> /u/bolwonder </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i0uq9q/kill_bill_what_was_the_brides_specialty_her_best/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1i0uq9q/kill_bill_what_was_the_brides_specialty_her_best/">[comments]</a></span>

I believe the first time I ever saw him was in “That Thing you Do” and kind of forgot about him until “Saving Silverman” came out. That performance solidified a special spot for me.

I&#39;ve always had an interest in noir, but struggled to find the initiative to watch such old movies. I got the opportunity from a recent trip home, and was (mostly) delighted by what I saw. I wanted to share my recommendations across different categories for anyone who was interested.</p> <p><em>Favourite cinematography:</em> <strong>Night of the Hunter (1955).</strong> About a serial killing preacher who marries into a grieving family to try and find some buried cash.

Standout is the scene where two characters having a stand-off sing to one another in the night.</p> <p><em>Favourite acting:</em> <strong>Sunset Boulevard (1950).</strong> A scriptwriter gets involved with an ageing actress who can&#39;t come to terms wi
