## Paquetá kickstarts Potter era but Fulham almost spoil West Ham party

<p>It was just as West Ham imagined it when they spent more than £100m last summer. Lucas Paquetá up front, two left-backs on the pitch at the end and the latest man to sit in the home ­dugout at the London Stadium wondering if his new employers are always this baffling.</p><p>This was a game that West Ham did their best not to win, so much so that they even let in two crosses from Alex Iwobi. Still, though, Graham Potter found logic in the puzzle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/west-ham-fulham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just when it seemed nothing was dropping for Liverpool in a captivating contest, Arne Slot turned to his substitutes’ bench midway through the second half and exhibited his seemingly golden touch. Kostas Tsimikas and Diogo Jota entered, the former teeing up the latter at a corner to equalise courtesy of their first touches. It was Liverpool’s first shot on target and the first goal Nottingham Forest had conceded in more than 500 minutes of action.</p><p>For Forest, this is a simply a ride supporters do not want to step off. This was another resounding display under Nuno Espírito Santo, another impressive step in an extraordinary season and a point lifts them to second, six points behind the pacesetters, who also have a game in hand. On this evidence, we may just have a title race, especially with both Chelsea and Manchester City dropping more points.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/nottingham-forest-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue read

## James thwarts Bournemouth but act of redemption cannot halt Chelsea slide

<p>From title challengers to top-four contenders to reviving the undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the club’s direction, quite the slide for Chelsea. The returning Thomas Tuchel will have seen few of the players he left behind in 2022 but he will, though, have been reminded of the permanent jeopardy of being Chelsea manager.</p><p>Previously a safe pair of hands guiding the Chelsea project, Enzo Maresca’s formula for success is wobbling. His team showed a combination of callowness and profligacy, struggling with a spirited Bournemouth team stripped to bare bones. It took an added-time free-kick from Reece James, openly criticised by Maresca, his Chelsea career hampered by injury, and a survivor from Tuchel’s time, to prevent defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/chelsea-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Manchester City throw away 2-0 lead as Nørgaard strikes late for Brentford

<p>When Brentford missed their first couple of chances, Thomas Frank applauded his approval and encourage­ment. But they kept mis­sing them: by the end of the first half his head was in his hands; by the time Yoane Wissa somehow shot into Nathan Aké with the goal at his mercy and 20 minutes remaining he was prostrate, forehead pressed into the turf in supplication. Maybe ­someone was listening.</p><p>Phil Foden had opened the ­scoring moments earlier, and shortly afterwards he tapped in the rebound after Savinho’s shot was saved to ­apparently make the game safe. Instead the pendulum swung: Mads Roerslev’s volleyed centre found Wissa all alone on the edge of the six-yard box to pull a goal back, and in stoppage time Christian Nørgaard headed in from Keane Lewis-Potter’s cross. In the end it took Aké’s goalline clearance from Bryan Mbeumo’s shot to ensure City ended this wildly entertaining encounter with a point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/brentford

Tom Hanks, somewhat famously, collects something that’s simultaneously more practical and unwieldy: typewriters. And unlike Steve Martin’s paintings or Leo’s figures, you can currently get a look at some of the Hanks typewriters at The Church, an exhibition venue in Long Island’s Sag Harbor.</p><p>Some of Tom’s Typewriters includes 35 from his collection of over 300, chosen by Hanks himself. These include an electric typewriter from the set of Mad Men (the curators are, as yet, unclear as to how Hanks obtained this, but he’s recording an electronic guide to accompany the show that they are hoping will explain), an

<p>Newly retired Kai is a miserable grump who lives alone, until he adopts Piggy, in this honest Hong Kong take on family dynamics and suicide</p><p>There is a daffy streak of eccentricity in this rambling shaggy dog tale from Hong Kong. It’s the story of a stray mutt called Piggy (played by mongrel Little) who saves a man from suicide not once, but twice. The man is newly retired Kai (Lawrence Cheng), a miserable grump who lives alone. Like Larry David, he’s not afraid of telling people exactly what he thinks (and, like Larry David, it can be excruciating to watch). But Piggy has taken a shine to Kai, and when she spots him attempting to hang himself in the woods, she intervenes, superdoggy style.</p><p>In all sorts of ways, Alone No More is a conventional heart-tugger, pushing its sentimental message about the benefits to mind and body of pet ownership, and making a point about social isolation among older people. Predictably, Kai adopts Piggy, and his irascible outbursts begin to

In <em>Music As Medicine</em>, Daniel Levitin makes a valiant attempt to do just that, citing in his introductory chapter heavyweights such as Confucius – “Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without” – and Plato – “More than anything else, rhythm and harmony&nbsp;find their way into the&nbsp;inmost soul and take hold upon&nbsp;it”.</p><p>While both these statements attest to the deep pleasure to be derived from music – its soothing rather than healing properties – perhaps the most pertinent quote comes from the late <a href="https://www.theguardi
