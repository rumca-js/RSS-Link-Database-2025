<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am making a web scraper for Amazon using Selenium. It works fine on my own computer, but when I deploy it on AWS, the website loads completely differently, probably because the AWS proxies are blocked. Is there a solution to this, without using a residential proxy? I am fine with using another cloud provider.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Yubullyme69420"> /u/Yubullyme69420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i1bt1i/best_way_to_deploy_a_scraper_without_using_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i1bt1i/best_way_to_deploy_a_scraper_without_using_a/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m scraping a cloudflare protected website. Recently they&#39;ve upped their shit because the ipv6 datacenter proxies I was using are now getting blocked. Previously ran for months on end.</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to understand what proxies I should try next. I read about rotating residential, those charge by GB and I&#39;m making 30 requests every 5 seconds so it probably isn&#39;t economical. I&#39;ve seen ISP proxies. If I grab about 4-5 of these and rotate them in my code, would I have similar results to a residential proxy?</p> <p>Any other route I can take to cut costs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuarkistani"> /u/Fuarkistani </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i0wsol/question_about_proxy_selection/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1i0wsol/question_about_proxy_selection/">[comments]</a></span>
