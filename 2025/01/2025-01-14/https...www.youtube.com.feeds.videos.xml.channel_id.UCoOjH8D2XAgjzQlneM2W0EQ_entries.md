It’s August 13, 1963, and America was coming out of a recession
People weren’t working, people weren’t confident
So JFK knew he needed to do something to get the people back on their feet, to give them some hope,  some opportunity! And that’s when he announced something BIG: a huge 20% tax cut for everyone, 
Not just for corporate America, not just for the cronies, but a ton of tax cuts for every single American across the board
And so, he stood in front of the nation, saying that this was your time to get rich! This was your chance to get wealthy!
We’re talking hundreds of billions of dollars were made over just the next 4 years,

Whether you like him or not, Trump is handing you this exact same golden opportunity right now 
Lower taxes, less regulation,  
hopefully less government spending
Except this time, with the internet, with the size of the market, with how fast thing
