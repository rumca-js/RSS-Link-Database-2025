## People are saying “they wouldn’t intentionally burn the houses of the elites” don’t realize that Hollywood Actors aren’t actually “elites”

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Stanley Kubrick told us, in Eyes Wide Shut, that most of these people at the Holiday Party are employees, there to serve and provide pleasure. These Hollywood actors were tools, and live by the grace of the actual rulers of this earth. Hollywood talent, is live stock. They’re cattle. They’re chattel. They’re only pieces that the powerful move around a board. </p> <p>If you can see past the theater of the Hollywood regency, it becomes very clear that all these stars are disposable once they served, and have passed their usefulness. </p> <p>It’s not shocking that they would intentionally burn all their houses down.

But it turns out the “taking care of people” part is only for a certain demographic. The job was great in the Denver market. Had a chance to work with some awesome people. But in the Northwest market it’s pretty clear that if you are not a woman or trans, management will immediately treat you different. As a black straight man all I ever ran into was ridicule and trainers rolling their eyes. They wanted me to follow every standard to a T or I would lose my job. But everyone around me could do what ever they wanted. The District manager I had was clearly racist and sexist. If it was a woman that needed help or didn’t understand something she would be super nice and resourceful, following the person around like a puppy. If I asked for help or coaching I was told that I am “slow and retarded.” Appar
