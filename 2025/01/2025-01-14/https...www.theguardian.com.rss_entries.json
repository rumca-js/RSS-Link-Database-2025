Kostas Tsimikas and Diogo Jota entered, the former teeing up the latter at a corner to equalise courtesy of their first touches. It was Liverpool\u2019s first shot on target and the first goal Nottingham Forest had conceded in more than 500 minutes of action.</p><p>For Forest, this is a simply a ride supporters do not want to step off. This was another resounding display under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, another impressive step in an extraordinary season and a point lifts them to second, six points behind the pacesetters, who also have a game in hand. On this evidence, we may just have a title race, especially with both Chelsea and Manchester City dropping more points.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/nottingham-forest-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Continue read",

Maybe \u00adsomeone was listening.</p><p>Phil Foden had opened the \u00adscoring moments earlier, and shortly afterwards he tapped in the rebound after Savinho\u2019s shot was saved to \u00adapparently make the game safe. Instead the pendulum swung: Mads Roerslev\u2019s volleyed centre found Wissa all alone on the edge of the six-yard box to pull a goal back, and in stoppage time Christian N\u00f8rgaard headed in from Keane Lewis-Potter\u2019s cross. In the end it took Ak\u00e9\u2019s goalline clearance from Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s shot to ensure City ended this wildly entertaining encounter with a point.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/brentford",
