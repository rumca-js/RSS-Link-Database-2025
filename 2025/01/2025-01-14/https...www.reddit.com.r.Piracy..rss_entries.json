Losing books one loves is bad enough but losing 5+ years of repertoire one learned to play is some <em>buuuuulllllshit.</em> So I decided to write a script to download all my saved library as PDFs because fuck Everand. The script is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/evmer/scribd-downloader\">evmer&#39;s scribd-downloader</a> so big thanks to them. It has been modified to work with Everand&#39;s latest UI and to automatically grab all the book URLs from the saved list in Everand rather than the user needing to copy/paste the URLs manually.</p> <p>Script and instructions are here, hopefully someone finds it useful. <a href=\"https://github.com/DanMannMann/fuck-everand\">https://github.com/DanMannMann/fuck-everand</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Divinised-Void\"> /u/Divinised-Void </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/c",
