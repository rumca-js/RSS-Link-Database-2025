How to prime subfloors for DITRA peel and stick…I use a 1/4” nap roller to apply primer. It’s important to apply a thin coat. This allows the primer to absorb quickly into plywood or concrete. I set a timer then check to see if the primer has cured. Then I test the primer with a small piece of DITRA peel and stick.
