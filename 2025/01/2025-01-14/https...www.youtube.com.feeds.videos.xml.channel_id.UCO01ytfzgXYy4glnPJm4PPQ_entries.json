        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as an OnlyFans \u201ccreator\u201d claims to have slept with a thousand men in a single day, a recent report suggests that nearly one and a half million women in this country are currently selling their bodies on the platform. Prostitution is now, for the first time, a mainstream part of American culture. How do we change that? We\u2019ll discuss. Also, why aren\u2019t more Americans making the connection between climate change and the wildfires in California? That\u2019s the question CNN is asking. The answer is obvious: because there is no connection. A video goes viral of an Eagles fan verbally accosting a woman while the woman\u2019s fianc\u00e9 sits by and records it. And, a Hollywood actor who has had a long career in Hollywood and amassed millions of dollars says that his life story is a testament to the horrors of systemic racism.\n\nEp.1514\n\n- - -\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.yout",
