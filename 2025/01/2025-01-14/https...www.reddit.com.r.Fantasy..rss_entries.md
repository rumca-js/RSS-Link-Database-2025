<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious what books/series that are generally beloved by this subreddit (so, not romantasy or anything by RF Kuang) you never intend to read, and why (without just crapping on it)?</p> <p>I’ll start - mine is Malazan. Possibly the most recommended series here. By many accounts, I should want to read it. I love long, sprawling, big fantasies (WOT, ROTE, Cosmere), and I enjoy a big cast of characters. The reasons I don’t think I’ll ever read it are:</p> <p>**comments that the characters spend an inordinate of time waxing philosophical. No problem with that in moderation but it seems excessive. </p> <p>**I know it’s not actually grimdark but I think there’s probably more violence and darkness than I want. As an example, I hated A Little Life more than almost anything I’ve ever read. Somehow, ROTE falls juuuust on the right side of the fence in terms of despair and misery. </p> <p>**I’ve heard that women are overall written well but that there is a LO

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>considering one of my normal comfort read authors is apparently a bit of a monster I thought i would highlight a series that has just wrapped up by one of my other long standing comfort authors.</p> <p>the Black dog series is a long running YA urban fantasy series set in a world similar to ours which has gone through a magical conflict/ War between two of the most powerful supernatural nations the Black Dogs werewolf adjacent shape shifters and Vampires and their allies/ spawn Blood kin ( ghouls ). As a result the existence of the supernatural has blown up and many of the Black dogs are on the run looking for a room and safe haven in a new world.</p> <p>series has a strong found family vibe, a lot of really interesting lore, a good bit of grit and while earlier books revolve around the younger protagonists the older characters get POV as the story goes on indeed the series feels less and less YA as the series goes on.

I’ve tried several recommendations, including Tad Williams and Jacqueline Carey, but I never felt connected to their characters. On top of that, I’m not a fan of world-building that dumps two chapters’ worth of information and history on you. What I loved about Hobb’s writing was how she revealed the world naturally, making it relevant to the story. She made me care about the history and the people because it all unfolded organically as I read.</p> <p>That said, I think I’ve finally found a replacement in Michael J. Sullivan! I started with Theft of Swords and was immediately drawn in. I’ve only just begun, but so far, this feels the closest to Hobb’s style. For anyone else searching for a replacement, I highly recommend Michael J. Sullivan.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Communication499">

So, I guess Heroic Fantasy!</p> <p>I would just pick up a Gemmell book to fulfil my need, but I want to see if there more recommendations out there, and are there any recent books that fit the mould.</p> <p>It would be great is it has limited PoV characters.</p> <p>Thanks!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am just burnt out on books lately. I haven&#39;t found a book that I like in a long time, and when I search, I find the same recommendations over and over again. Ugh!</p> <p>And this is not an indictment against popular books! I&#39;m sure those books are wonderful. I&#39;m just looking for something different right now. I really like the precocious stoic, mysterious loner types of protagonists that are forced by circumstances to interact with others (I know so lame of me &gt;.&lt;). And if there is a power system, I&#39;d like it to not be Sanderson-esque with a bunch of definite predefined rules. I have searched far and wide, and now I&#39;m seeking help. </p> <p><strong>Edit: please please please only suggest books where the <em>protagonist</em> fits the character description above</strong>. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Osucic"> /u/Osucic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/

I am currently outlining a novel, and there is going to be more action than I previously thought there to be. Both physical, and magic fight scenes are preferred.

None but intellect genius, etc. I like a mixture like the Avengers and JLA. I mostly like the female protagonists but am open minded to male protagonists. </p> <p>I don’t know why but the team has to have an Iron Man like character male or female on it. I search the net constantly and have run out of searches. I’ve probably read 200 superhero novels in the last 10 years. I even read web serials. Even the bad ones. I love reading. </p> <p>If anyone can suggest anything I would appreciate it. Any sites I

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for recommendations for vampire fantasy books. </p> <p>Just some background on what I am looking for... I am looking for something like what we saw in Twilight. BUT WAIT! Don&#39;t judge me just yet!</p> <p>Not the actual story in Twilight. I didn&#39;t enjoy the story in the movies and haven&#39;t read the books. My fiancee is a huge fan and watches the movies every year. When I watch with her, I always feel like there was a HUGE missed opportunity with the Volturi (the Vampire council people) in those movies. They basically control the vampire world and make sure they are kept secret from the humans. And they have different clans, powers, etc... it always seemed like it&#39;d make a cool movie/book to see the origins of that council and dive more into what they do.</p> <p>I am looking for something that is kind of similar to that. Basically, I would like to dive into a book that deals a lot in vampire culture, secrets, powers, and w
