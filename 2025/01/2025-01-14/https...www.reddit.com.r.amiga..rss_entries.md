<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Title. A rom upgrade hopefully should be easy enough if it literally is just prying the old one out and pushing the new one in. I would still want memory upgrades to at least 2 mb for octamed. If it requires soldering forget it as I am a complete beginner to computer internals and installing internal expansions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Bear_1980"> /u/Ok_Bear_1980 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i1itkd/easy_memory_upgrade_of_amiga_500_to_2_mb/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i1itkd/easy_memory_upgrade_of_amiga_500_to_2_mb/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a kid, there was this game that I could never play / understand - it had a scene where you would see your character running on some metal gateway, with a planet (earth?) seen in the background.</p> <p>The music was epic and I find myself sometimes humming it, only to be unable to recall the music an hour later.</p> <p>I know it involved fighting, but can&#39;t recall exactly what, and there was a control room in that space station ( ?) where you&#39;d pick your next fight (you&#39;d be then seen running on that gateway to, I think, jump in your fighter or a gun turret? </p> <p>It&#39;s a bit hazy. I just remember not being able to play it and now would like to try again.</p> <p>Do you guys know what it was?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/captainmycaptn"> /u/captainmycaptn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i15r0j/help_me_find_the_name_of_that_game_pls/">[link]<
