If anyone doesn&#39;t know, it&#39;s a competition to find the best unpublished games, judged by designers and publishers. As far as I&#39;m aware it&#39;s the only one of its kind, and whilst based in the US is open to everyone.</p> <p>I&#39;m asking for a couple of reasons. Firstly the competition is currently open and I think it&#39;s a fantastic oppportunity so I&#39;m spreading the word. Secondly, I&#39;ll be publishing a previous finalist later this year, and in the marketing I&#39;ve got &#39;Cardboard Edison Awards Finalist&#39; as one of the key selling points. In my head it&#39;s shorthand for solid game design.

I was having a board game night with my friends recently and someone brought over this card game called &quot;The Curse of Camp Wila-Haunchoo.&quot; It was a game I had never seen or heard about before anywhere. Turns out my friend&#39;s, friend&#39;s brother actually made the game!</p> <p>Very basically, it&#39;s a social deduction game similar to Mafia. There are all these different cards that do different things (i.e., damage, action cards, or healing cards). There are two teams of players, &quot;cursed&quot; and &quot;campers&quot;, and each is trying to kill the other, but only the &quot;cursed&quot; know everyone else&#39;s role. </p> <p>It was super fun, so, I thought I&#39;d post about it here if anybody else is interested in buying up some new games.

My boyfriend is really into board games, particularly more in depth games like twilight imperium, spirit island, etc. and he\u2019s bummed he can never find anyone to play with him. I also like board games, but I\u2019ve only really played easier ones and I have a hard time with games that have a ton of rules and a thousand moving parts. Essentially, things like ticket to ride and settlers of catan are on the upper end of the difficulty level I\u2019ve played but the lowest level of difficulty he enjoys playing. His birthday is coming up and I want to get him some games we can play together, do you guys have any recommendations for games that would keep an experienced player interested but wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for a newbie to learn? Thanks!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imanidiot2120\"> /u/imanidiot2120 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i1cddn/games_that_a",

When I asked Alan &amp; Sean a decade ago, they had said those roles got archived. However, one of my friends from the Werewolf Forum had said there was another person on BGG that had a pnp of those missing characters. Unfortunately, that person was afk and never responded to geekmail on BGG.
