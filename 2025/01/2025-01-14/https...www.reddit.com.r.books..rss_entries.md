<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was reflecting on the way the books I&#39;ve read have shaped me and the way I think about the world and wanted to share some of my insights, and hear some of yours as well! These are very random selections of mine, just from books that I either really enjoyed or left a strong impression on me. I&#39;m sure I could have written a whole 500 page essay on this, and I plan to flesh it out better on my blog, but wanted to share some of my quick thoughts.</p> <p>Harry Potter series: Don&#39;t let the world make you cold, no matter how it treats you.</p> <p>Dune: Fear is the mind killer (self explanatory).</p> <p>A Man Called Ove: Community is essential.</p> <p>No Longer Human: Distraction is not the same thing as healing.</p> <p>The Stranger: Life has no universal meaning, we give it our own meaning. (an interesting one for me to reconcile with my very weak/slight religious beliefs)</p> <p>Crime and Punishment: Guilt is the strongest emotion someone can

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m trying to read more as a way to get away from screens (or at least from my phone and computer since I do enjoy reading on my kindle). The thing is, I’ve been trying for years without much success, I always end up dropping the books, new books I buy sit unread forever and yeah, I felt like I had lost the ability to read due to so much phone usage. </p> <p>But this month I had a realization, something I kind of knew but somehow did not accepted: I kept trying to read books I honestly didn’t care for. Books who seemed good, books that were popular or books who had good reviews. Even books who seemed smart. And for what? To just drop them after less than a chapter read in most cases. </p> <p>The way I came upon this realization was after I started the year reading my favorite book (Pride and prejudice), and I noticed that although I did got distracted frequently, I still wanted to keep reading and the distraction mostly came from it being the first t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finished <strong>Karla’s Choice</strong> this morning. Quite a good read! It had all of the strengths and weaknesses of Le Carré at his best. It benefitted from being a conscious recreation of the Smiley era, as opposed to some of the later JLC books, which were hit and miss. If the author failed in any respects to recreate his father’s style, it was that this book actually had an action sequence (which are almost entirely absent in JLC’s other books), and frankly, it was easier to follow than most of JLC’s, despite being appropriately convoluted! </p> <p>One aspect I read in a review that I agree with is that women – Susanna, Ann, and Connie – are more convincingly portrayed by Nick Harkaway than John Le Carre. It’s true that JLC – like Mordecai Richler, Robertson Davies, Stephen King and many other of my favourite male authors – struggles with feminine voices.</p> <p>I have some spoiler-heavy questions however:</p> <p>“Karla’s choice” refers to K

I decided to try listening to the audiobook in tandem with the physical copy. Nine pages in, I’m already starting to feel turned off. Not because of the middle school drama, but because of the writing.

It’s taken me an embarrassingly long amount of time to finish this book, so I have had a lot of time to sit with it. </p> <p>At face value, it’s not a particularly interesting read save for the absurdity of the concept. I read the English translation of course, and it was very easy to understand, almost entirely lacking any “poeticality”. But, it’s short so boredom can be excused. Actually, it reminded me quite a big of “The Yellow Wallpaper” as it is another text that if taken at face value, would be very unentertaining. I think this is the kind of book I would recommend to a teenager and then ask them for their analysis—makes sense why some schools have it in their teaching materials?</p> <p>Going beyond the writing style and entertainment value, I found it to be very very interesting. I wasn’t thinking of this book much while reading it, and I read it haphazardly. However, the other day I found

But I actually really like the “Lucy” part:</p> <p>The looming dread, the slow escalation from the arrival of an empty ship to the final confrontation with Lucy in the grave. It feels like a perfect book within the book for me.</p> <p>Instead, I do think that the final part that drags a little bit. All those trackings for ship schedule. Splitting up our heroes to three parties but didn’t really utilize the split.</p> <p>And I do wish it was a bit clearer on why Dracula let Jonathan alive that long or what was his plan with him. In my mind I read it as he was planning to make Jonathan the next Renfield. But yeah I wish it was more explicit.</p> <p>But all minor complaints. Overall its a timeless boo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, throughout my education, once in high school and twice in undergrad, I was supposed to read Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms”, and thrice I did not. So, in celebration of said novel entering into the public domain on January 1 of this year, one of my 24 goals on my 2025 Bingo Card (and indeed my biggest goal) was to read Hemingway’s “A Farewell to Arms”. And I just finished the book. </p> <p>First, in reading it, I completely understand why I could never make it through the book as a younger man. The first several chapters of the book are kind of dull and uninteresting even now. Plus, it’s clear from early on that it’s a romance and, as a teenage boy, there’s no way a novel set in WWI that focused not on the war but on romance was going to interest me. Honestly, I would be surprised if any high schooler could appreciate the story. </p> <p>Second, honestly, even now I’m not the biggest fan of the book. The prose is phenomenal. Hemingway is a master

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all!</p> <p>I’ve been on a Didion kick in the last few days amid the LA wildfires (not in an evac zone but the air quality is so poor I cannot go outside). </p> <p>I’ve read her fiction before, namely Play It As It Lays, and I did not particularly care for it. </p> <p>I read Slouching Towards Bethlehem and the White Album in the last couple days and loved both. Even when the topic is not one I particularly care for, her writing is so electric I cannot put it down. Based off the immense love I saw online for it, I started today the Year of Magical Thinking. I’m about 75% of the way through it. </p> <p>I have a particular disconnect with it, however. Many online speak to its emotional weight but, to me, the way it’s written is very clinical and sterile of any emotion. Perhaps it’s the last quarter which contains the sucker punch everyone seems to feel while reading it. I just feel like perhaps I’m missing something. I still enjoy the book, again

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I have gotten back into reading over the last three years and it used to be something I really enjoyed when I was younger. However, I find myself struggling to feel excited or strongly emotionally connected to a book. Even if I liked the book and thought it had a good plot or an interesting writing style or good characters, I still don’t feel a “gushing” connection about the book. Maybe I am putting an unrealistic expectation on myself or over thinking it, but it has really been bothering me.</p> <p>For example, when talking to my friends they get very passionate about books they’ve really liked and I haven’t felt that same way with any of my books. Idk, maybe it’s me, since in general it’s hard for me to get excited/energetic about anything. But I still want to have that feeling and question what is holding me back? Am I too harsh on the books I read? Am I not going into it with the right mindset?</p> <p>Hopefully this resonates with s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a huge fan of Adrian McKinty&#39;s &quot;Sean Duffy&quot; detective series. He&#39;s working in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, and McKinty actually grew up in that time/place. The books are incredibly immersive, with a great balance of humor and action. Duffy is witty and likable, and has some escapades at the pub along with his police work. The mysteries are engaging, and the tension caused by paramilitary groups in the region add to the suspense. </p> <p>I heartily recommend this series to folks who enjoy character-driven detective novels. </p> <p>Book 8 comes out in March! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/timshel_turtle"> /u/timshel_turtle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i0vtk0/sean_duffy_series_by_adrian_mckinty_book_8_coming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i0vtk0/sean_duffy_series_by_adrian_mc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this constant discussion about separating the art from the artist has become something like flogging a dead horse, but I want to throw my two cents into it.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure people have heard news about Neil Gaiman and the late Cormac McCarthy, and yes, it&#39;s completely unpleasant. I like the works of Gaiman and I like &quot;The Road&quot; by McCarthy, but is it even justified to stop reading them if they may have done something that&#39;s completely wrong? No.</p> <p>Even if they&#39;ve done something that may, or may be, sketchy as all get out, I will still like the work they did, but not like the person they may actually be. If a person doesn&#39;t like a writer because of something they did and don&#39;t want to read their work, that&#39;s prerogative. If you don&#39;t like it, because of one reason or another, then don&#39;t read it!</p> <p>I think there are people who hold authors in way too high a standard, people who see them as

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a somewhat fan of Palahniuk. Love how his books are kind of eerie and you know kind of gory and disturbing. So, I had lots of hopes for <em>Lullaby</em>. And, damn was it a let down.</p> <p>The beginning was pretty good, but as the story progresses the story just bored me. I don&#39;t even know what I was expecting and it still let me down unlike Palahniuk&#39;s other novels. You can see his signature style of gruesome gory details in this but it was not enough to keep me engaged. It was an easy read though. </p> <p>I felt the book was just dragged like a piece of chewing gum with Streator&#39;s narration. Could have been a shorter book, I guess. Anyways still got some nice fun(?) facts from his book. <span class="md-spoiler-text">Starlings, Waultraud Wagner, &amp; carps, etc.</span></p> <p>I&#39;d recommend people to read <em>Lullaby</em> if they are extremely bored and got nothing else to read. Thats just me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub
