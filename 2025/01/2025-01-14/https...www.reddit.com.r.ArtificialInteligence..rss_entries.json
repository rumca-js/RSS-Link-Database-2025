This is empowering hoards by the thousands to create some bland \u201cagent\u201d that hounds people in the most disingenuous way, providing 0 value to anyone involved.

I think for such a complex and sophisticated machine we must not rush it. Yes, innovation is important, but I think safety is even more important. Even if it takes 100 years to build a safe ASI, it\u2019s better than rushing it and potentially causing catastrophic consequences like eradicating humanity. Especially when this technology will change probably not only Earth but the entire universe and whatever else is out there. I sense that people who want this technology right now don\u2019t really care for safety and they just want the quick benefits like ASI curing diseases or finding a way to reverse aging and potentially find a way for immortality. It seems counterintuitive if we develop a system that was meant to enhance our lives just for it to eradicate us.
