<p>Enterprise computers are often the ugly ducklings of the PC world, viewed as dull, slow and less feature-rich than their consumer counterparts. But vendors at last week’s <a href="https://www.ces.tech" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.ces.tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consumer Electronics Show</a> launched a selection of business machines (alongside their consumer offerings) hoping to capitalize on the rise of generative AI (genAI). </p>

<p>Smart glasses attracted a lot of attention at last week’s <a href="https://www.ces.tech/">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, with a range of devices on display that combine lightweight frames with functionality such as heads-up displays and AI-powered assistants. </p>



<p>These contrast with the mixed-reality headsets that created a buzz early in 2024, including <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1636856/meta-quest-3s-mixed-reality-passthrough-broadens-workplace-appeal.html">Meta’s Quest 3</a> and <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3629732/almost-a-year-since-launch-apples-vision-pro-still-searching-for-a-killer-app.html">Apple’s Vision Pro</a> – both of which are much hea

<p>The European Commission (EC) might have at last seen the sense of pulling back on some of its <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3603484/europe-gives-apple-yet-another-regulatory-nightmare.html">scrutiny of big tech</a>, which could yet benefit Apple and Google.

<p>It’s looking like 2025 will be one of the most consequential years for Microsoft in a long time.  Since Satya Nadella became CEO in early 2014, the company has been on an upward trajectory, despite a few bumps along the way. Today it’s the most powerful AI company on the planet and the world’s third-most-valuable company, worth more than $3 trillion.</p>



<p>But in these volatile times, that can change quickly thanks to a still evolving AI market, the federal government targeting high tech, and the coming wild-card Trump presidency. What challenges will the company face in 2025, and how will it handle them? </p>



<p>Here are my top five.</p>

<p>Audits are never fun — whether you’re talking about a tax audit, energy audit, or industry compliance audits. But they’re necessary. And when it comes to mobile device management (MDM) deployments, they’re extra important, because mobile devices are endpoints that can expose your company to the security dangers and risk letting corporate data leak out.</p>



<p>Here’s what to consider as you plan an MDM audit and what to include.</p>

<p>A rash of planned feature and application retirements within the Microsoft 365 environment is the result of Microsoft wanting to centralize, modernize, operationalize customer spend, and ultimately economize by simplifying product offerings where it can, an industry analyst said Monday.</p>



<p>Jeremy Roberts, senior workshop director at Info-Tech Research Group, said the fact that a number of Microsoft 365 (M365) services have been or will soon be mothballed does not come as a surprise, as Microsoft has been making quite a few changes to the product. He described those changes as “the nature of SaaS [software-as-a-service]. You get with it, or you get left behind.”</p>

<p>Nobody could accuse the British Government of lacking enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI). According to its newly published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-sets-out-blueprint-to-turbocharge-ai">AI Opportunities Action Plan</a>, the technology’s blossoming will remake the British economy, boost productivity, smooth bureaucracy, and transform the quality of state services such as healthcare.</p>



<p>Through this, the government wants the UK to become an AI superpower, consolidating its position as the world’s third largest AI market, behind the US and China, the report said.</p>
