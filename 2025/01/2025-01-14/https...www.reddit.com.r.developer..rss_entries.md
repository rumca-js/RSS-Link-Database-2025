<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m a fullstack developer and I have been working in a big company for two years. Now I am a bit bored, the team is not very good, this project is like doing always the same thing and I have lost motivation. I have an offer from a game studio that is a startup, do you think it is risky to change? My fear is leaving something secure in a big company for a startup that could go bad tomorrow (maybe?). Do you have any advice?</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snowthunder14"> /u/Snowthunder14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i1b0xe/do_i_accept_to_change_job_or_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i1b0xe/do_i_accept_to_change_job_or_not/">[comments]</a></span>
