Enter string_view, a lightweight view into character sequences. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore the fundamentals of string_view, its advantages over traditional string, how it compares to std::span, common pitfalls to avoid, and practical case studies for using it effectively. Whether you\u2019re a beginner or an intermediate developer, join us to enhance your code\u2019s performance and adopt better practices.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Unraveling_string_view.pdf\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nPrithvi Okade\n---\n\nJasmine Lopez\n---\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering for the entire C++ community. The conference is organized by the C++ community for the community. Y",
