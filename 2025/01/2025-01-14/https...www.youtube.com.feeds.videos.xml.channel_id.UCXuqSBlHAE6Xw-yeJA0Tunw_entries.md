Yep it’s true, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the first game that was developed from the ground up to use Ray Tracing… not just as an OPTION to make the lighting a little more realistic… but as a core - REQUIRED - component of the game. Does that mean every game’s FPS is gonna suffer? Or are we going to enter a golden age of Ray Traced Bliss where we can no longer tell the difference between reality and the metaverse? Do we all need NEW Graphics Cards?
