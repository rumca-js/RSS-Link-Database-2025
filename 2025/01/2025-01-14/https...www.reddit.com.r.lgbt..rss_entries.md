<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just as the title says. Context- my employer, male, spoke with his business partner, female, and they both are trying to remove the pride flag that&#39;s been hanging by our office window since I started working there. They said they&#39;re fine with it being there during pride month, but not all year. I was told this by my manager, and he doesn&#39;t seem bothered by it either. I told him not everyone is gonna be happy about that, both employees and patrons. I tried to keep my cool, Im a straight guy, but that information ticked me off. They even said the Open sign is rainbow colors too. I told him it&#39;s an open sign that happen to be rainbow colors, and that shouldn&#39;t bother anyone. They want to rid of that too. </p> <p>Not sure how to go about it. Do I tell my coworkers? My manager, who is a generally nice human being, trusted me enough to give me this info. He even went to say &#39;just between you and me.&#39; </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#

I’m pretty new to posting on Reddit so if I’m doing it wrong, please let me know.</p> <p>Over the last couple of years, I have noticed a pattern of shows with queer representation getting canceled. A lot of them seemed to be ending sooner than expected - The Owl House, A League of Their Own, Gentleman Jack, Our Flag Means Death, Dead Boy Detectives, KAOS…</p> <p>There weren’t any sources to tell me if this was normal for TV shows. Lots of shows get canceled, so I wasn’t sure if queer shows were being treated unfairly. To find out, I decided to research it myself.</p> <p>Rotten Tomatoes and Deadline have lists of all TV shows canceled and renewed in 2024, so I pulled that information. I went through and got rid of all of the reality shows, and then went down the list one by one to find out if each show was canceled and whether it was queer. In the end, I researched over 350 shows.
