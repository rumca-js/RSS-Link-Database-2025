They said they&#39;re fine with it being there during pride month, but not all year. I was told this by my manager, and he doesn&#39;t seem bothered by it either. I told him not everyone is gonna be happy about that, both employees and patrons. I tried to keep my cool, Im a straight guy, but that information ticked me off. They even said the Open sign is rainbow colors too. I told him it&#39;s an open sign that happen to be rainbow colors, and that shouldn&#39;t bother anyone. They want to rid of that too. </p> <p>Not sure how to go about it. Do I tell my coworkers? My manager, who is a generally nice human being, trusted me enough to give me this info.

Lots of shows get canceled, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if queer shows were being treated unfairly. To find out, I decided to research it myself.</p> <p>Rotten Tomatoes and Deadline have lists of all TV shows canceled and renewed in 2024, so I pulled that information.
