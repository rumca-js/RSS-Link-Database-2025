I know there are tons of MMORPGs, and RPGs that allow this format, but in playing them it never feels the same as whats in those shows. They always potray 90-95% of the player base as mid level adventurers with only a few top tier rare S tier players, but in games i&#39;ve played like FFXIV everyone is pretty quickly the max level and the dungeons aren&#39;t really about loot collection or anything.</p> <p>So my question is, is the MMORPG/RPG potrayed in the kinds of shows like Sword Art Online and other similar anime even exist? I love games with a slow burn mid-tier level, I feel like most get you on to the high-end tier quickly and kinda burn out. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
