<p>Free VPNs are no longer just for PCs. Android users can enjoy the same privacy protections on their devices, as well. Whether you want extra security while using a public Wi-Fi network, or to get around geo-locked content on your favorite streaming services, the right free VPN can help you do it without having to pay a cent.</p>



<p>The problem when looking for a good free VPN, though, is that there are a ton available on the Google Play Store and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2361057/privacy-issues-with-top-android-vpns-puts-2-5-billion-users-at-risk.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2361057/privacy-issues-with-top-android-vpns-puts-2-5-billion-users-at-risk.html">many aren’t trustworthy</a>.

<p>If you’re on the hunt for a new laptop for work or school, then you’re going to love this Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 deal. <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-14-2-in-1-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7440-2-in-1-laptop/useichbts7440hbtv">On sale for a mere $650 at Dell.com</a>, this laptop is everything you need to get through the day — and it’s a hot buy now that it’s $300 off (was $950).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2474360/dell-inspiron-14-2-in-1-review.html">This laptop has a nifty 2-in-1 design</a>, which means you can swap between using it like a traditional laptop or as a tablet. The 360-degree hinge folds all the way back, allowing it to go completely flat and basically turn into an oversized tablet. That same hinge also makes it easy to tent the laptop in propped position for watching movies or reading documen

<p>One of the most vocal opponents of the never-launched Venu Sports bundle just took the wraps off its own bundle of sports channels—and yes, ESPN stations are part of the deal. </p>



<p>Launching today in 24 metro markets, <a href="https://streamtv.directv.com/mysports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DirecTV’s MySports package</a> serves up roughly 40 sports-oriented channels, such as ACC Network, Big Ten Network, DIRECTV 4K Live, DIRECTV 4K Live 2, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, Golf Channel, MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network, NHL Network, SEC Network, TBS, TNT, TruTV, and USA Network. </p>



<p>MySports subscribers will also get access to local ABC, Fox, and NBC stations, with ESPN+ and “additional” local stations (presumably including CBS affiliates, which are currently missing from the list) “coming online soon.”

<p id="gpar1">The KB5048239 update for Windows 10 — which released a while ago on November 12, 2024 to make some improvements to the Windows Recovery Environment — is apparently causing headaches for some users. Anyone who tries to install the patch ends up stuck in a loop.</p>



<p><a href="https://borncity.com/win/2025/01/14/windows-10-win-re-update-kb5048239-causes-re-install-loop-jan-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Born’s Tech and Windows World blog</a> has been getting emails from readers about the update, which installs correctly at first, but when Windows Update is opened again later, the same exact update is offered for installation. This occurs over and over again. Other system tools, like the Windows Event Viewer and Norton 360, show the update as successfully installed despite the issue.</p>
