<p>As time goes on with a single character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a>, you'll begin to accumulate quite a bit of wealth. Your inventory will be full of gold as well as other forms of currency, such as orbs of various rarity. While you can use your orbs for their intended uses, you can also trade them to acquire different forms of currency that you don't have or need more of.</p><p>This trading goes down at the Currency Exchange, which is an extremely useful tool to have at your disposal as you get into the endgame. However, the Currency Exchange isn't something you unlock right at the start of Path of Exile 2.</p><h2>Unlocking the Currency Exchange in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Fortunately, unlike other endgame content in Path of Exile 2, you don't need to reach the endgame to start using the Currency Exchange. All you have to do is beat the main campaign a single time on Normal difficulty.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/article

From clearing every map's boss your heart desires on the Atlas to further customizing your build with Atlas Points, the endgame in Path of Exile 2 can essentially go on as long as you want to keep playing. To aid you along your endgame journey, the game implements a mechanic known as the Hideout.</p><p>The Hideout is your own space that you can customize and set up however you want. You're able to visit your Hideout to change out gear, craft new items, talk to NPC vendors, and access the Map Device, which is how you navigate the endgame and the Atlas. There are a few requirements you need to meet before unlocking your Hideout in Path of Exile 2, though, so check out the guide below to see the steps.</p></h3></p><b

<p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals has come for the hero-shooter crown, and it's hard to argue that it doesn't have a legitimate claim to the throne. It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.</p><p dir="ltr">Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic

What defines an indie game is somewhat up for debate, and in some cases it can be difficult to tell indies from bigger titles. </p><p>One person's definition of an indie may not match another's, but generally, an indie game is developed by one person or a small team without a larger publisher's budget behind it. Sometimes, the developer behind an indie game will grow into a larger studio and develop future games that are considered outside the realm of the indie label. Indies don't have to be a certain type of game or feature any kind of particular graphics or gameplay. The driving force behind what makes an indie game is the person or people behind the scenes developing it, as well as the funding behind them. That can make it a challenge to

This is not a trailer, though, but instead the key creatives appear in the video to discuss their ambitions for the project, with footage from the film cut in between the quotes.</p><p>One of the first things that is apparent is that the Until Dawn movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-gets-a-key-update-about-its-story/1100-6528665/">does not re-tell the story of the game, but instead tells a new, original story</a> within the universe. Peter Stormare's character, Dr. Hill, from the game appears in the movie as the connective tissue, however. The original game featured Hollywood actors like Rami Malek and Hayden Panettiere, but they will apparently not show up in the film.</p><p>The Until Dawn movie cast includes Odessa A'zion, Michael Cimino, Maia Mitchell, Ella Rubin, Belmont Cameli, Ji-young Yoo, and Willem van der Vegt, in addition to Stormare.</

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.</p><p dir="ltr">DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health.
