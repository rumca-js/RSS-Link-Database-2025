<p>Adobe has brought collaboration to Photoshop, allowing users to work together on an image editing project in much the same way a team could work on a Microsoft 365 document or one within Google Workspace.</p>



<p>Adobe calls this “Live Co-Editing” and the company is opening up a beta-testing program for both the Photoshop desktop (beta) app as well as the existing Web apps.</p>



<p>Adobe isn’t saying how many people can work on a shared project at once. The company also isn’t saying how it will handle various scenarios where one person works on one part of a project, makes a change, and then rolls it back, adjusting the other collaborator’s workflow as well. </p>



<p>And while it might be valuable for a student to follow along while a teacher demonstrates something on a shared project, this new Live Co-Editing model also theoretically allows a client

<p>Intel appears to have finally, at long last, put its Core Ultra 200 performance debacle to rest. And if you apply the appropriate software updates and BIOS fixes, the performance impact should be pretty significant.</p>



<p>At CES, Intel concluded its months-long effort to solve the complex issues that caused the desktop Core Ultra 200 processors (codenamed “Arrow Lake-S”) to demonstrate lower performance than expected. In December, Intel put out the first half of a <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Field-Update-1-of-2-Intel-Core-Ultra-200S-Series-Performance/post/1650490">report</a> which concluded that there were numerous reasons for the lower performance, from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2500721/warning-most-windows-power-settings-slow-intels-new-cpus-to-a-crawl.html">performance power plans</a> to anti-

<p>One of our favorite Microsoft Surface Laptops has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Windows-Touchscreen-Snapdragon/dp/B0CXL21K6M/">dropped by a massive 27 percent on Amazon</a>. This means you can get a solid 15-inch Surface config for just $1,240 instead of its original $1,700 MSRP — an enormous savings of $460 on a top-tier machine.</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2375677/surface-laptop-2024-review-a-new-era-for-windows-laptops.html">reviewed the 2024 Surface Laptop</a>, we gave it a four-star rating and our expert appreciated its attractive design, superb battery life, and good performance on an everyday basis.</p>



<p>This 7th edition of the Surface Laptop features the powerful 12-core Snapdragon X Elite CPU and 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM, making it part of Microsoft’s new line-up of Copilot+ laptops. There’s also

<p>AI-powered video descriptions are the new hotness when it comes to security cameras. Amazon’s Ring cameras and Google’s Nest cams are already doing them, and now Wyze is joining the party. </p>



<p>Available now as part of a new–and pricey–“Cam Unlimited Pro” plan, Wyze’s “descriptive alerts” serve up AI-generated captions for video events captured by your Wyze cams, complete with “important details and contextual information.” </p>



<p>So, rather than getting Wyze alerts that just say “Driveway” or “Bedroom,” subscribers to the new plan will get AI descriptions with details such as “Three babies are helping each other climb out of their cribs,” or “Front Door caught a suspicious person walking up to the porch and picking up a package.” </p>



<p>Besides the AI-powered video alerts, Wyze users are also getting AI search, meaning you can find clips in

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1937700/2023s-biggest-desktop-pc-trend-the-war-on-cables.html">“War on Cables” trend</a> rages on and Asus is on the front lines. In 2023 and 2024, Asus eagerly embraced the trend with “BTF” motherboards and cases designed to stealthily hide cables around the rear of desktop PCs, but designs shown off at CES 2025 indicate that they could step things up a notch soon. How so? A massive graphics card power connection right on the motherboard.</p>

<p>Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm. Which do you want powering your PC? If you don’t prefer any of them, you might have another option soon — and the name will be quite familiar. According to industry rumors, Nvidia is hoping to hop on the Arm-powered PC train for the larger consumer mass market later this year.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since Nvidia’s Arm offerings have made headlines for consumers. At the moment, the company is still best known for its Tegra processors, with which it attempted to break into the mobile market over a decade ago, and which still power the Nintendo Switch and the Nvidia Shield set-top box. (Rumors have also pointed to a Nvidia chip for the highly anticipated Switch successor.)</p>

<p>All Windows 11 users now have access to Microsoft Paint’s new “Generative Erase” AI feature, reports <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/01/14/windows-11-microsoft-paint-ai-generative-erase-is-now-available-for-everyone/">Windows Latest</a>.</p>



<p>The new feature, which was previously exclusive to Windows 11 Insider preview testers, makes it easier to remove unwanted objects from images. Microsoft Paint uses AI to analyze the surroundings, then fills in the selected area based on surrounding patterns and textures.</p>



<p>To use the feature, it’s as easy as selecting an area on the image and clicking “Generative Erase” to remove an object.</p>



<p>A quick test shows that the result can vary in quality, however, ranging from near-perfect deletions to less-than-satisfactory smears. It all seems to depend on how complex the image is in the fir

<p>Do you need lots of portable storage? Say, for example, enough to carry approximately one million copies of Sir Mix-a-Lot’s “Baby Got Back” on MP3? (That’s about 4TB, if you’re wondering.) And would you like to get it at a similarly ridiculous discount?</p>



<p>Then check out Samsung’s Shield T7 portable SSD. Today, B&H has <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1742972-REG/samsung_mu_pe4t0s_am_4tb_t7_shield_portable.html">the 4TB version for just $249.99</a>, almost $200 off its retail price.</p>

<p>A new version of Google’s Chrome browser has recently been released, and one of the new features is the program’s performance tools. In particular, they are designed to reduce energy consumption, thus improving the battery life of a laptop.</p>



<p>One way to do this is through something called inactive tabs. A tab that is open in the background can consume a lot of data and the solution is to leave the tab inactive when you are not using it. An inactive tab consumes much less data, but it takes a little longer to open.</p>



<p>Inactive tabs now have a dotted circle around them, and an icon that looks like a speedometer also appears. Clicking on it will show you how much memory Chrome has saved by making a tab inactive. </p>

<p>I know just how annoying it is when Wi-Fi reception is crappy in certain areas of the house. If you’re suffering from this too, you might be considering upgrading to an expensive new router to fix it. But is there anything else you can try before shelling out a ton of cash on that?</p>



<p>Well, yes! A Wi-Fi extender (also called a Wi-Fi repeater or Wi-Fi booster) could be just the thing for you, and right now you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC750-WiFi-Range-Extender/dp/B07N1WW638/">snag this TP-Link Wi-Fi extender on Amazon for just $14.81</a>. That’s 18 percent off its usual price of $18 — an even better price on what’s already a bargain.</p>



<p>This tiny device is easy to use. It just plugs into any wall outlet, then you spend a few minutes connecting it to your home Wi-Fi network (on either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands). Once connected

<p>The one thing I expected to see at CES was a flood of laptops with Thunderbolt 5 connections attached. Yet, as far as I could tell, there wasn’t a single one.</p>



<p>Thunderbolt 4? Sure. Laptops with that specification were commonplace. But laptop makers don’t seem to be embracing Thunderbolt 5 yet, even though <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2061073/thunderbolt-5-will-debut-in-2025-with-gamer-class-charging-and-i-o.html">Intel officially announced the Thunderbolt 5 specification</a> in late 2023 for shipment in 2024. </p>



<p>It’s now 2025, and Thunderbolt 5 was essentially a no-show at CES.</p>



<p>Why? From my conversations at the show, device makers blamed two things: first, the continued lack of Intel chipsets with integrated Thunderbolt 5 inside. But they also pointed to the stalled transition to 8K content. Without it, device makers
