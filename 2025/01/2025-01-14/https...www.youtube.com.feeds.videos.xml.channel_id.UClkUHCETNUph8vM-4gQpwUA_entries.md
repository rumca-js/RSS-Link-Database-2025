The Wayward Realms FIRST LOOK – Spiritual Successor to ELDER SCROLLS?
The Wayward Realms is an RPG game that is being developed by Once Lost Games, a studio led by Ted Peterson and Julian LeFay, who are two of the minds behind The Elder Scrolls: Arena and Daggerfall. Their ultimate goal is to create what they’re calling a “Grand RPG,” a massive and dynamic experience where your choices truly shape the world around you and they hope that The Wayward Realms does exactly just that. In this game, you’ll be thrown into an archipelago filled with procedurally-generated cities and whatnot.
