The putative class action accompanies several other similar cases filed in recent weeks, including one by Legal Eagle, but is a separate case. These may get combined at some point, and we talk about that in interviews at the end. We're additionally joined by Wendell of Level1 Techs, who provides insights as to how the allegations against Honey would align with not only creator harm, but consumer harm. It is also the belief of GamersNexus that PayPal and Honey's actions have harmed consumers directly.\n\nFind CPM Legal's PayPal & Honey class action lawsuit page here: https://www.cpmlegal.com/cases-CPM-Investigati",
