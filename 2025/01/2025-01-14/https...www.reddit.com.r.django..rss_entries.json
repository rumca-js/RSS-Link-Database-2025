In forms I have to check for whether fields are present and validate for each and every field. In views I have to check whether correct template is used, forms submission is valid or not. The project is taking too long and the functionality I would have been able to finish in 2-3 hours is taking me 2-3 days. </p> <p>So whats the practical approach in implementing TDD?
