        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nDetails of the unannounced The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake may have been accidentally revealed. A former employee at game studio Virtuos allegedly revealed its existence, which seems to confirm an earlier leak that happened during the FTC v Microsoft trial. The game will be made using Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to some of the combat, especially blocking. In related news, 'Nate the Hate,' the Youtuber who recently reported on the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal date, is also claiming that Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 this year. It's looking like a strong third-party lineup for the Switch 2's launch, with the system reportedly also getting Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Assassin's Creed Mirage. And finally, Marvel Rivals players may have found more evidence that the game is using bots.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

        "description": "Aloft reviewed in early access by Travis Northup on PC.\n\nAloft is a promising blend of a survival crafting game and cozy sensibilities with a memorable airborne setting, but it misses the mark in quite a few other places as of its early access launch. Turning any floating island into your own personal flying pirate ship is very satisfying, and mixing survival mechanics with low-stakes, feel-good charm is a potent combination. That said, with weak and repetitive combat encounters, a scarcity of things to keep you busy, and loads of technical issues, there\u2019s a lot of room left for improvement that can be a little tough to endure at the moment. There are enough good ideas here that I\u2019m optimistic Aloft could be quite worth your time at some point in the future, but right now you might want to wait for stronger winds to blow before setting sail.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

DK\u2019s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it\u2019s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as \u201cgood enough\u201d and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles.
