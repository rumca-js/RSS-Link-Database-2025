Their ultimate goal is to create what they\u2019re calling a \u201cGrand RPG,\u201d a massive and dynamic experience where your choices truly shape the world around you and they hope that The Wayward Realms does exactly just that. In this game, you\u2019ll be thrown into an archipelago filled with procedurally-generated cities and whatnot. \n\nTimestamps\n0:00 -  The Wayward Realms First Look\n0:10 - What is Wayward Realms\n1:51 - The Wayward Realms Story and Setting\n4:44 - The Wayward Realms Gameplay Mechanics\n8:24 - Development\n10:00 - Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our ",
