In today's Daily Fix:
Details of the unannounced The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake may have been accidentally revealed. A former employee at game studio Virtuos allegedly revealed its existence, which seems to confirm an earlier leak that happened during the FTC v Microsoft trial. The game will be made using Unreal Engine 5, and will feature changes to some of the combat, especially blocking. In related news, 'Nate the Hate,' the Youtuber who recently reported on the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal date, is also claiming that Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 this year. It's looking like a strong third-party lineup for the Switch 2's launch, with the system reportedly also getting Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Assassin's Creed Mirage. And finally, Marvel Rivals players may have found more evidence that the game is using bots.

Aloft reviewed in early access by Travis Northup on PC.

Aloft is a promising blend of a survival crafting game and cozy sensibilities with a memorable airborne setting, but it misses the mark in quite a few other places as of its early access launch. Turning any floating island into your own personal flying pirate ship is very satisfying, and mixing survival mechanics with low-stakes, feel-good charm is a potent combination. That said, with weak and repetitive combat encounters, a scarcity of things to keep you busy, and loads of technical issues, there’s a lot of room left for improvement that can be a little tough to endure at the moment. There are enough good ideas here that I’m optimistic Aloft could be quite worth your time at some point in the future, but right now you might want to wait for stronger winds to blow before setting sail.

Take a look at the first look of the Until Dawn movie, distributed by PlayStation Productions.

One year after her sister Melanie mysteriously disappeared, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where she vanished in search of answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one…only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening. Trapped in the valley, they’re forced to relive the nightmare again and again - only each time the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last. Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of deaths left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.

Until Dawn stars Ella Rubin, Michael Cimino, Odessa A\zion, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Maia Mitchell, and Peter Stormare. The film is directed by David F. Sandberg and written by Blair Butler and Gary Dauberman.

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD reviewed by Logan Plant on Nintendo Switch.

Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned… Again… but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is still a competent update and easily the best way to pla
