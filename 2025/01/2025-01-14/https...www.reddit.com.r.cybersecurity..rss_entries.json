At my workplace, a project team want to publish online a Google Doc with settings that allow anyone on the internet to Comment, for stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>From a data governance perspective this is ok because the project document has no data that is sensitive, confidential, personally identifiable etc. It is just a high-level summary of things that are already in the public domain. Also Google Docs masks the identity of viewers or Commenters (unless they give it their consent to use their named Google accounts), so there is no issue with data breaches around anyone on the internet who might view the doc or add a Comment to it.</p> <p>But someone has asked whether there could be a cybersecurity risk to the organisation.</p> <p>Does this seem plausible to anyone here? If so, what would the risk be? And is there anything we can do to prevent or mitigate it?</p> ",

I\u2019m just showing up like here I am. I never ever imagined this for myself. I was in school a looooong while ago, got an associates in Criminal Justice and went back for a Biology degree. I thought I would do something related to forensics or something since those two can work together. I was almost ready to transfer to a 4 year when life happened. Now many moons later, I\u2019m here. It sounded cool and fun and, bonus, I might have an \u201cin\u201d when all is said and done. </p> <p>Anyways, what\u2019s been your experience? How did you get to this field? </p> <p>Ps.

We have very good buy in from leadership so we have a strong budget to implement what we need. We have strong security practices and security awareness training and an MSSP that provides 24/7 support supplementing our internal IT..</p> <p>I am new to my position (1yr) and think that overall out company is in pretty good shape security-wise but fear I don&#39;t know enough to see what we may be missing.</p> <p>Any thoughts or suggestions?
