<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all!</p> <p>So the game <em>Acquire</em> has been around since 1963, and there have been <em>several</em> editions of it printed since then, of varying qualities. I&#39;ve wanted to pick up a copy for a long time, now, and I was just wondering which editions people in here prefer. Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bilbo_the_innkeeper"> /u/bilbo_the_innkeeper </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i1i7e1/best_editions_of_acquire/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i1i7e1/best_editions_of_acquire/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just wondering if people are aware of these, and if so how much regard they give them? If anyone doesn&#39;t know, it&#39;s a competition to find the best unpublished games, judged by designers and publishers. As far as I&#39;m aware it&#39;s the only one of its kind, and whilst based in the US is open to everyone.</p> <p>I&#39;m asking for a couple of reasons. Firstly the competition is currently open and I think it&#39;s a fantastic oppportunity so I&#39;m spreading the word. Secondly, I&#39;ll be publishing a previous finalist later this year, and in the marketing I&#39;ve got &#39;Cardboard Edison Awards Finalist&#39; as one of the key selling points. In my head it&#39;s shorthand for solid game design. But if nobody knows what it is then I&#39;m questioning having it at all.</p> <p>Link to this years awards details: <a href="https://cardboardedison.com/award">https://cardboardedison.com/award</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, all. I was having a board game night with my friends recently and someone brought over this card game called &quot;The Curse of Camp Wila-Haunchoo.&quot; It was a game I had never seen or heard about before anywhere. Turns out my friend&#39;s, friend&#39;s brother actually made the game!</p> <p>Very basically, it&#39;s a social deduction game similar to Mafia. There are all these different cards that do different things (i.e., damage, action cards, or healing cards). There are two teams of players, &quot;cursed&quot; and &quot;campers&quot;, and each is trying to kill the other, but only the &quot;cursed&quot; know everyone else&#39;s role. </p> <p>It was super fun, so, I thought I&#39;d post about it here if anybody else is interested in buying up some new games.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to play this kind of games, they remind me Age Of Empires and my first choice was Rune Wars (not the miniature game) but idk if it has been discontinued cause Im livin hell to find it. I want more like a Fantasy themed not like a sci-fi, also idk what TI means, I saw it a lot in other post. I know Heroes of the land, sea and air, Eclipse, Clash of cultures and obviously Runewars. Runewars sounds Amazing with the 4 armys, the seasons and the seven years of play, the deep of the frozen water and flying through mountains, I want something like that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DonGhetto27"> /u/DonGhetto27 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0ym2p/any_fantasy_4x_game_for_50150_usd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0ym2p/any_fantasy_4x_game_for_50150_usd/">[comments]</a></span>

## How Many Plays Does It Take to Decide If a Game Is Right for You?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m curious—how do you decide if a game is right for you? Do you need multiple plays to figure it out, or is one enough? I’m not talking about mastering the game or getting good at it, but rather determining whether it clicks with you personally.</p> <p>Can you tell if you’ll like a game just by watching videos or reading the rules? Or do you need to actually play it, and if so, does it take a few plays to make up your mind?</p> <p>Everyone learns and experiences games differently, and there’s no right or wrong way to have fun. But sometimes, it feels like there’s pressure from others to approach gaming a specific way. Let’s talk about it—how do you decide if a game earns a spot in your collection or at your table?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BoardGameRevolution"> /u/BoardGameRevolution </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0x3ow/how_many_plays_does_it_take_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My wife and I just played our first play through of Watergate. So many twists and turns as you play. You can think you have a great play or an amazing round strategy to simply be outdone by a single card/play from your opponent. I haven’t experienced that many ups and downs in a game before. Absolutely love it!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chief2504"> /u/Chief2504 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0wvfv/damn_watergate_is_a_great_2p_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0wvfv/damn_watergate_is_a_great_2p_game/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;ll try to keep this brief. I come from aoud Italian family. We used to have dinner every Sunday. We used to play games after dinner on holidays, and we always had fun. They were usually games like Taboo, LRC, apples to apples, scattergories, and other casual stuff like that. We&#39;ve also done games like Ransom Notes, or CAH and had fun as well. Even grandma is ok with being a little obscene. </p> <p>I&#39;ve got them to agree to try to start doing a game night about once a month. What are some other games we should try? Nothing too involved. Nothing that goes on for hours. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/monkeysareeverywhere"> /u/monkeysareeverywhere </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0synt/family_game_night/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i0synt/family_game_night/">[comments]</a></span>
