This girl , her brother and her brothers bestfriend go out one night to steal a car from the valet stand of a casino or hotel or something . (Little sister has always had a crush on her brothers bestfriend and he includes her in things the brother tries not to.) Brother gets caught or something so Bestfriend snatches up the little sister and drives away , but they end up wrecking and she permanently damages her leg . Years later they see each other again (pretty sure their high schoolers now) and she has a limp still . it\u2019s tension but they end up falling in love against brothers wishes.

I&#39;ve been an avid reader ever since I was 12 and ever since then I just haven&#39;t been reading like my pre-teen self anymore (I am 24). The pandemic really gave me time to get back into it but sadly, I am back in my old ways of not even reading a sentence that has nothing to do with my college course. I want to read some short (between a 100 - 200 page count) and interesting (a bit out there, i.e weird) books. I would also love some short story collection recommendations so that I can pause between stories without needing to remember what happened because I do get quite busy. (I basically have no life outside) For reference, here are a list of books I enjoyed: - Bunny by: Bora Chung - Convenience Store Woman by: Sayaka Murata - Earthlings by: Sayaka Murata - Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke by: Eric LaRocca - Paradise Rot by: Jenny Hval - The Vegetarian by: Han Kang - Kim Ji Young Born 1982 by: Cho Nam Ju</p> <p>I do enjoy",

I\u2019m sure some of it was just burnout (from my English/creative writing degree), but really, she gave me my love for reading. I found out that acute trauma can also damage the part of your brain that makes words into pictures. This is all to say that reading has become a physical and psychological challenge. I\u2019ll start a book, get frustrated that it \u201churts to read,\u201d and abandon it.</p> <p>That is, until I randomly picked up Murakami\u2019s After Dark from my father\u2019s bookshelf. </p> <p>I can\u2019t explain it but that book gripped me immediately, and let me sit still with it, in a way no other book has been able to. I think maybe it was prose well suited to my mental capacity \u2014 dreamy, liminal, surreal. But also very concrete without being overwhelming. In a very Hemingway way there\u2019s a simplicity and accuracy to the chosen details. It\u2019s somehow such a clear book, but also so strange.</",

I guess the best way I can describe what I&#39;m asking for would be if George R. R. Martin were to write a fantasy pirate series. </p> <p>I&#39;ve had an interest in pirates my whole life, and I think it&#39;s finally time I delve more into the fiction side of pirate books. <em>Treasure Island</em> was one of my favourite books growing up, and I loved that its spiritual successor TV show <em>Black Sails</em> did such a great job turning pirates into a Game of Thrones-esque series, I just wish there was a book series that was able to encompass this the same way.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read:</p> <p><em>\\</em> Treasure Island*</p> <p><em>\\</em> Republic of Pirates*</p> <p><em>\\</em> Pirate Latitudes*</p> <p>* and of course, all of <em>One Piece</em></p> <p>Feel free to hit me with your favourite non-fiction ",

I don&#39;t mind smut, I grew up on it (debatably sad lol) via fanfiction. But some of these books are marketed with cutesy covers and contemporary plotlines, but are just throwing two paper dolls together to be able to rub them into oblivion for the sake of smut? So I&#39;m hoping to find some that have better writing (first person is definitely picky for me, cause I can&#39;t stand a plethora of swearing and being written like they&#39;re 15) and good relationships? I&#39;m open to subgenres and such, lemme know what you recommend, even popular books cause I haven&#39;t read that many tbh lol! Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- S",
