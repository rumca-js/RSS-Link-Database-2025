I&#39;m also visually impaired and high contrast themes(similar to OLED themes) increase visibility tremendously. Does anyone know of any applications with the feature, or an easy way to implement this? Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zeezoop\"> /u/zeezoop </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i1dogm/rss_feed_aggregator_with_a_high_contrast_theme/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i1dogm/rss_feed_aggregator_with_a_high_contrast_theme/\">[comments]</a></span>",
