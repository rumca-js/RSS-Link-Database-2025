Its products are expensive relative to the\nwireless speakers that have flooded the market from big-name tech\nrivals like Amazon and no-name competitors from China. And yet,\nSonos held on partly because it had a commitment to high-quality\nsound and an Apple-like dedication to user experience, both of\nwhich gave it a passionate fan base.</p>\n\n<p>The events of the last year seem to have ruptured that\nrelationship with many of its customers.
