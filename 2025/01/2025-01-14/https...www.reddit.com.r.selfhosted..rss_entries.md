## Paperless-ngx in a manufacturing environment?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if this isnt appropriate for here, I saw somebody else a similar question about Paperless&#39; functionality so I thought I would throw my hat in the ring too. </p> <p>I&#39;m IT/sysadmin for a small manufacturing firm and my boss asked me to look into a system we could use to streamline how we scan Purchase Orders and Travellers.</p> <p>Currently, we have somebody sitting at a computer with scanning software, and they manually swap back and forth between POs and Travellers and Misc. If they are scanning a PO, they toggle it to a PO(which sets the folder it saves to), runs the paperwork through the scanner, verify it went to the proper folder with the proper name and then grab the next packet.</p> <p>If I understand Paperless correctly, the main difference would be that this person (or anybody else in the building hypothetically) would not have to manually toggle anything on the scanner itself to a PO/Traveler, they would just scan it in normal

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I’m curious about how you all monitor your servers. Do you rely on comprehensive tools like CheckMK or the full Grafana + Prometheus stack? Or do you prefer simpler setups with tools like Beszel?</p> <p>For context, I currently have free VMs running on Azure and Oracle Cloud. Are these setups sufficient for running a solid monitoring stack? I’d also love to know how you handle the connections between different services.</p> <p>I’ve linked my main server with the others via Tailscale, which works great for now. However, I’m curious how you deal with externally hosted services. How do you handle access to UIs? Do you open ports to the internet, or do you have other methods to access those URLs securely?</p> <p>If you have code snippets, tips, or recommendations to share, I’d greatly appreciate it! Looking forward to hearing how you handle these challenges.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href

How to mitigate a risk that someone gets the domain which is used for many different account registrations.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used a few Raspberry Pi 4 for different projects over the past few years, but am not using them anymore at the moment. I have a much more powerful machine that&#39;s up 24/7 as a server, and all my services run on that.</p> <p>I have three Raspberry Pi 4 left (I believe two 4GB and one 8GB). Before trying to sell them or give them away, I wonder, what could I do with those beyond running service $x on them, that my already running server could do better with little added cost anyway? I also have some home automation/IoT stuff, but don&#39;t need them as gateways or anything - I use ESP8266s or ESP32s for that already.</p> <p>Any creative ideas here? I&#39;m well aware that this is a solution in search of a problem, and is more about the exercise of using them rather than achieving anything useful - so there&#39;s no dumb answers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kernald31"> /u/kernald31 </a> <br

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve got a spare PC which I use as a server, I currently have windows installed and use googles remote desktop to access it, but I know this is far from ideal and I was just wondering what kind of OS would be good for this sort of thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FalconFails"> /u/FalconFails </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0tdzo/best_os_for_hosting_a_modded_minecraft_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i0tdzo/best_os_for_hosting_a_modded_minecraft_server/">[comments]</a></span>
