        "description": "<p>John Blanche is a visionary artist who has shaped the look and feel of the Warhammer IP like no other. But now that he's retired, he's joined team Army Painter to make his own paint sets?! In this review, I show you all 20 colours from both John Blanche Masterclass Sets. I'll explore how the new colours fit into the existing Warpaints Fanatic range, and whether these sets are worth the hype or just a cash-in on a prestigious name.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/01/review-john-blanche-masterclass-paint-sets-vol-1-2/\">Review: John Blanche Masterclass paint sets Vol. 1 &amp; 2</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
