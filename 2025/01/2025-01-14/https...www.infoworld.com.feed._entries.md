<p>For years, I’ve cautioned organizations about the hidden downsides of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2683784/what-is-cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a>. Ironically, I’m “Dave the cloud guy” who warns enterprises about the cloud.</p>



<p>The benefits of the cloud’s agility, scalability, and innovation can quickly become a financial sinkhole without proper management. Enterprises are finally waking up, and it’s been fascinating to watch the recent shift to diligent <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2517787/learning-cloud-cost-management-the-hard-way.html">cloud cost management</a>.</p>

<p>How does the journey to a knowledge graph start with unstructured data—such as text, images, and other media? The evolution of web search engines offers an instructive example, showing how knowledge can be extracted from unstructured sources and refined over time into a structured, interconnected graph. As we will show in this post, this process underpins the journey from <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3712227/what-is-rag-more-accurate-and-reliable-llms.html">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (RAG) systems to more sophisticated approaches like GraphRAG and Knowledge-GraphRAG.</p>
