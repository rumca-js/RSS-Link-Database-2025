<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just wanted to share my experience, as there seems to be a consensus that third-party Amazon cables are as good as the Meta Link cable. In my case, this was not be true.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using the Quest 3 pretty much since its release as my main PCVR sim racing headset. I love that with the FOV multiplier, I can get a solid 120Hz in any game, which unfortunately, no native DisplayPort HMD offers.</p> <p>However, something always felt a bit off. I could not achieve completely smooth fluidity. I&#39;m very sensitive to any type of frame drops or late frame delivery, and what I noticed with the Quest was that every now and then, maybe once or twice every 30 seconds, something felt off. The best way I can describe it is that I was seeing either a frame duplication or a missed frame, resulting in a very brief stutter. This was most noticeable in sharp corners where frames differ significantly. Sometimes I also heard a crack in the built-in speakers.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been experiencing this bug with almost every PCVR game now. I’ve recently bought a new RX 7700 xt, and PCVR works like a charm with virtual desktop. One little problem tho: every 3-5 minutes, FPS drops like crazy and latency and networking spikes up a lot, for about 5 seconds, then it goes back to normal. Every game works fine even with ultra settings at both 90 or 72 fps. Note that I’m currently using a quest 2 with medium preset and max bitrate.</p> <p>Anyone knows a fix for this? Might be AMD? (Driver ver: 24.12.1)</p> <p><strong>edit</strong>: tried with any kind of bitrate lower than max value (yes, even 10) and it didn&#39;t change a thing. Even tried dynamic bitrate and still nothing.<br/> Lowering the bitrate seems to have fixed the issue only on VTOL vr tho, and i might know why: to resolve another kind of stuttering problem I was experiencing, I&#39;ve changed the startup option of the game to make it run on OpenXR, and it runs perfect

A completely unknown name before the event, at least for me, XEO stunned attendees with its innovative approach to home VR and cinematic experiences. Here&#39;s why the XEO Big and XEO Pod could be quite an innovation in home entertainment and even for PCVR enthusiasts that love immersive sound experiences.</p> <p>XEO Big: A MicroOLED Powerhouse for PCVR</p> <p>The XEO Big is a wired PCVR headset featuring 4K microOLED displays and inside-out tracking, eliminating the need for external ba

Then I learned that Skyrim isn&#39;t compatible with the PSVR2, only the PSVR1 which would seem like a waste to get now. </p> <p>Then I learned about this insanely fun looking game which isn&#39;t available on PSVR at all: Blade and Sorcery. This suddenly became the game I wanna play the most. Meaning I would have to get a headset and not be able to use any PS games with it. There really aren&#39;t that many that I currently feel I&#39;d be missing out on, basically only No Man&#39;s Sky since I can&#39;t play Skyrim. </p> <p>Note: I have a PC but it&#39;s over 10 years old.

I only just found out about Arken Age and thought it looked fantastic, after reading some very positive reviews and wanting to support VR devs I thought I&#39;d grab it. I&#39;ve played through the tutorial so far and am very impressed!</p> <p>However I just wanted to ask about the water. It seems from the tutorial that water is going to be a fairly prominent theme in the game. My issue is that I have a ridiculous phobia of being in water - yes, even in VR - and this can be quite off-putting for me. In the tutorial, I hardened up and dove in when I realised I absolutely needed to, then had a mini heart attack when I spotted the fellas swimming around there (until I figured they were friendly). By the end, I was on edge and anxiety levels were up, but I managed to swim around a bit to collect the hidden items, and actually was able to appreciate the atmosphere.</p> <p>W

I know its an older headset, but at the same time, it&#39;s still holding its own quite well in todays age in my opinion. Many of people on Marketplace are also selling &quot;combo&#39;s&quot;, where it has the whole index kit and 3 vive trackers for around the price of the index new, (hence the 1k mark).

As far as weight goes, the Superlight 8K does just fine in this regard. However, the strap isn&#39;t very comfortable, and puts a certain amount of pressure on the forehead. It also produces a small amount of heat, which, while it didn&#39;t bother me, is noticeable and could be problematic for some. The facial interface as well is not very comfortable, and slips around in ways I don&#39;t really like. The lack of a top strap, as well, is noticeable and in my opinion a definite requirement.</p> <p>Di

Do you play UEVR? how many FPS do you get? do you achieve 72/90 fps without ASW? If not, how close are the numbers? Would a 5090 with 25-30% performance lift you over 72/90 fps? </p> <p>I&#39;ve seen videos of Cp2077 with 25- 35fps (without dlss, but RT(?)) in flat! (4090/5090) so how do you manage to play that in VR? </p> <p>Is RT / DLSS usable in VR?</p> <p>actually i own a Q3 and a pc with 12700k &amp; 3080 10GB, I never tried uevr because lol, I can&#39;t run alyx,behemoth etc on high/ultra so yeah. </p> <p>the 5080 has &quot;only&quot; 16GB (i fear i end up in 2 years with to less Vram like now) and reaches 50-65TFlops , so less then the 80Tflops from the 4090.</p> <p>the con with the 5090 beside the price (bye kidney lol), is id have to rebuild my entire pc, because i only have a 850watt psu, ddr4 etc.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I understand that this headset is mostly for those in specialized businesses or have very specific use-cases, but I have seen that some people also have this for PC VR.</p> <p>Does anyone know if this particular headset is even worth it for PC VR? I&#39;ve read that there&#39;s various crashes with the software, crashes with the PC, and also general stability/troubleshooting issues that doesn&#39;t seem to make it worth it for your average consumer.</p> <p>Does anyone have any updated information on the state of this, or whether people think it&#39;s worth it for PC VR and gaming only?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Some_Park1589"> /u/Some_Park1589 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i4nb7r/has_the_varjo_xr4_improved_at_all_for_pc_vr_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comment
