<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This short story collection was very good but not as good as I’d hoped it would be. It’s no doubt a very beautifully written, imaginative set of stories that center on a few main themes: Budapest throughout time, the suppression and control of art, art as liberation and transcendence, Eastern Europe under Communist control, cancer and dying, prejudice in small Southern towns, and a strange woman named Miss Grey who mysteriously arrives to help children in need. I personally prefer my dreamy, atmospheric fantasy to be set in secondary worlds as opposed to our world, but I think my main quibble with this collection is that a few too many stories left me thinking “Oh, that’s it?” at the end. That’s bound to happen with a few stories per each collection, but my favorite short story collections have more gems than duds in their ratio. That being said, my favorites of this collection were: </p> <p>-The Wings of Meister Wilhelm, for being sad, ambiguous and

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks! </p> <p>I&#39;ve been watching gameplay of this one game, Pilgrim, and its atmosphere has left a huge impression on me. The setting is this perpetually dark and overcast medieval realm, where here are small walled towns separated by miles of wasted land: dead twisted trees, crows, bones, and ruined cities and churches. Here, pilgrims are sent out to collect relics from these ruins and their dungeons, running the risk of attacks by grotesque horrors.</p> <p>I was wondering, are there any books out there with this dark, almost post-apocalyptic, medieval vibe?

In one week i was already in his third book, it is the most heartwarming tale of friendship and auto discovery i ever read, at leats to me, is something special. Give it a try! It helped me through shit i dont wish on anyone and it is the kind of work that makes you feel like a friend to the characters and that they say to you the same thing they say to eachother, so please, go meet Talia, Godrick, Sabae and Hugh, learn with them, laugh with them and cry with them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lovem

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have read some of the classics in the Dark Fantasy category (Second Apocalypse, Malazan, Black Company, First Law) but the main issue for me is that they are all Military Fanatsy. In particular I don&#39;t like following a group of soldiers and don&#39;t find it interesting enough. For example I didn&#39;t have the same issue with ASOIAF (my favorite book). Other examples would be &quot;The warded man&quot; (or Demon cycle by Peter V. Brett); also enjoed it a lot. Prince of Thorns was also ok.</p> <p>So what I am looking for are books with a dark(er), mature setting containing violence, morally grey/evil charecters and a story that does NOT follow a group of soldiers the whole time. Occasional battles like in ASOIAF are ok though.</p> <p>And please no standalones!

I’m just wondering do the timelines get easier to follow as the series progresses? Sometimes it feels like it has a flashback or a completely different scene in the middle of a chapter and I get insanely confused for a second. I found out that Mark Lawrence doesn’t visualize his books while he’s writing them because he has something called aphantasia. While I think it’s incredible that he’s able to write a vivid world like this without being able to see it himself I feel like sometimes things in here are hard for me myself to visualize but are still cool in concept.

Parker (Saevus Corex Trilogy)</li> <li>I also have read The Salt Grows Heavy and Lapvona</li> </ul> <p>It’s not a preference as I’m open to anything, but if you couldn’t tell by the authors I gravitate, I really enjoy the kind of writing that can both take itself seriously and not, includes humor, and themes of horror. But I’m open to any suggestions of any kind, as I feel a dose of something a little softer is always necessary to keep any nightmares at bay! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tie-False"> /u/Tie-False </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately I&#39;ve notice reptiles and Meso American art, armor, and architecture being combined in a lot of fantasy.</p> <p>Immediateexamples include: Chameleons palace from Kung fu Panda 4, Mythic Legions Ninian guard/infantry, Magic the Gatherings Ixalan expansion, Warhammer fantasy Seraphon/Lizardmen, The Elder Scrolls Argonian traditional armor, Warhammer Blood Bowl Amazon Warriors team.</p> <p>Obviously a lot of this is ambiguously Meso American, Gods forbid native american groups get direct and respectful recognition. But the similarities are clear. Blockly glyphs, hummingbird style colors, and gold metals being a plenty.</p> <p>But the big one. Reptiles being largely involved. My main assumption for this is by the time a fantasy writer gets to the rain forest region they already have other human races made and add beast folk to make a world seem more rounded and reptiles seem to make sense for a humid region. But also like MTG and AOS reptiles l

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I feel like in nearly every popular fantasy book that has a female protagonist, she is portrayed as morally grey. Or if she’s not introduced that way, that’s what her character arc ends up being.</p> <p>I feel like authors try so hard to portray their female characters as these unique, layered badasses who dont take shit from anyone that it loops back around to being Mary Sue’s evil twin. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not suggesting that female characters shouldn’t have any flaws or anything, but I’m just tired of reading about a ruthless killing machines who doesn’t give a shit about anyone except her two friends because the rest world took everything from her or whatever. Or another thing authors will do is that they’ll make the character to random shitty things just so they can be called an anti-hero, because I guess that’s what sells rn. </p> <p>Any recommendations for stories with a female protagonist who’s empathetic and actually gives a shit about t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>He&#39;s fine. His family is fine. They&#39;re well insured. It&#39;s going to be okay, but he&#39;s understandably stressed out. In the past he&#39;s told me he likes to read fantasy books because he can just check his worries at the door and immerse himself in dragons and whatever. So I want to slip one into the care package I&#39;m putting together for his family. Admittedly, I&#39;m an English teacher, but not a fantasy fan (sorry! I&#39;ve tried!), so I don&#39;t know where to start for adult fantasy. I would ask him, but he&#39;s very overwhelmed with all the things right now and he&#39;s not going to want to put together a list of ideas. So please! Help me out! What might be a fantasy/dragon book for a 43yo husband/dad who&#39;s educated and works in academia (fundraising) and is working to hold it all together? Maybe something that he might not have already read? Or maybe a classic that someone might want to read again?Any ideas? Thank you!🙏

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Read <strong>Green Man&#39;s Heir</strong> by Juliet Mckenna. It was a pretty good rural fantasy set in modern England. But it handled one aspect better than any book I&#39;ve read. The MC&#39;s mother is a Dryad and so he is essentially mixed-species. It affects him in tons of ways from having <span class="md-spoiler-text">a girlfriend dump him because he won&#39;t introduce her to his parents, having difficulties staying employed, to his mother not showing up in the NHS records until the day he was born.</span> He&#39;s a blue-collar type, and in the second half, he meets an upper-class character with a variation of the same problem. Her parents <span class="md-spoiler-text">spend a fortune on psychologists, and her less mundane relatives won&#39;t let her leave the area to get the advanced degree she wants.</span></p> <p>I&#39;ve come across a ton of books, usually D&amp;D based, that have similar mixed-race characters, often standard D&amp;D race

I want French to be the original language that it is written in. Also, I really love reading female authors but male authors are also welcome. I also just finished reading La passe-miroir series and absolutely loved it, so if you have something similar to it I would love that. </p> <p>Let me know what are your must-read books of this genre and bonus points if it isn’t very well known! </p> <p>I can’t wait to read your suggestions.
