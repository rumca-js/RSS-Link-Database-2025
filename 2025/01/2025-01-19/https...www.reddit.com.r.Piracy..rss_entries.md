<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, fellow sailors! </p> <p>I’ll be moving to the UK later this year and I’m wondering what extra precautions I’ll have to be taking with piracy once I’m there. Having grown up in Russia, I’m used to raw-dogging piracy sites and torrenting without any concern of being detected by the government. Only ever needed a VPN to access blocked content here. I know the UK will be a different experience, though, so I’m looking for advice. </p> <p>As far as torrenting goes, I am aware that in a country like the UK you can get in trouble for doing that if you are caught, so I’ll probably need a VPN. But I’m wondering if the same applies to streaming? It doesn’t feel like as big of a deal as torrenting, but who knows. Is it safe to go on streaming websites without a VPN?</p> <p>Also, since I’m a student I’ll be living in a dorm and I suppose I’ll have to be using my uni’s hotspot. Any way I can get in trouble if I pirate something while on it?</p> <p>Other tip

I have seen a couple of these “dramacool” websites, but I was wondering if they were legit. There are no/little ads or pop-ups, and the video links work. They don’t seem to have as large of a catalogue, but there are shows on there that proceeded the shutdown last year. Are these other sites affiliated with the original dramacool in any way, or are they just creating new sites with the old name?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Awkward-Error-825"> /u/Awkward-Error-825 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1i4oqo7/is_dramacool_back_up_or_have_other_people_started/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1i4oqo7/is_dramacool_back_up_or_have_other_people_s
