Don\u2019t get me wrong, I grew up blasting Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and AC/DC like they were the soundtrack to my life. But now, some of those tunes feel more like background noise than the anthems they used to be. I think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve just heard them too much. When something plays over and over, it starts to lose that magic.</p> <p>Take \u201cBack in Black,\u201d for example. Great song, no doubt, but how many times can you hear it before you start rolling your eyes? It\u2019s not that the song got worse; it\u2019s just that it got overplayed. Classic rock radio stations stick to the same 50 songs like they\u2019re afraid to dig deeper into the catalog. There\u2019s so much great music out there, but they keep shoving \u201c Bohemian Rhapsody\u201d and \u201cFree Bird\u201d in our ears like there\u2019s nothing else worth hearing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",

A GOOD one isn&#39;t a thing rn.</p> <p>I am so sick of trying to collab with people over the internet by sending files back and forth. IFYKYK. I&#39;ve gotten so sick of it to the point where I submitted this idea to a startup challenge at my college and we actually ended up winning first place. That was a shock honestly LMAO.</p> <p>If I tried to create something for producers by producers... would anyone actually be interested in this concept? Like I mean if I REALLY try. I know there have been a few attempts in the past, but l&#39;m shooting for something where the user interface is ACTUALLY good and where it would actually have semi-low latency. AND where file management would be included. And I mean every part of the DAW would be able to be manipulated ",
