The cards give your pieces more attack power or more defense value ( With a + 2 card, a general beats an field marshall ). Cards which give your pieces two movement or you can go diagonal. You can go over the water spaces or you get a kit which save you from bombs. A card which let the spy beats every other piece in his turn. Or a card which let you jump over a piece.</p> <p>You can use the card in one of the next five rounds, then you draw a new one. Unused cards go to the discard pile.</p> <p>This give the game an interessting, but only slight touch which don&#39;t change the game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RowSad9805"> /u/RowSad9805 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1i5ais8/stratego_65th_anniversary_edition_with_cards/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp

My kids (ages 7 and 9) have recently really enjoyed Outsmarted and the Kid Chronicles games and we&#39;d love to find some other family games that have some type of tv/app component.

I will have about 20 kids and am aiming to have one parent volunteer for every 4-5 kids to help teach/ manage the games. </p> <p>My main question is how to manage the kids and get them playing without it being a free-for-all. We only have 90 minutes, so I want to avoid spending the first 20-30 minutes with the kids running around trying to figure out who&#39;s going to play what, and who gets to play with whom. I was thinking about sending a sign-up sheet beforehand, and anyone who doesn&#39;t sign up in advance will be randomly assigned to a game. Hoping that won&#39;t feel too restrictive or structured.</p> <p>On the sign-up form, I had parents indicate their kid&#39;s familiarity with boa

So should’ve said right in the beginning, i’ve never played any other board game besides Monopoly and so I also expected the prices to be around 20-40€. But hell nah those are actually ~100€, and my teenage ahh can’t afford them at all.</p> <p>So my question is a lot more generic this time: What are your favourite 2-4 player games, that aren’t too expensive? (Important note, I really want those games to be equally interesting played in 2 or in 4) The genre doesn’t really matter, even tho if you got something similar to Inis or Acquire it would be great, but i’m pretty sure games with as much stuff inside

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi board gamers!</p> <p>I recently purchased a pre-owned copy of Aliens: Another Glorious Day in the Corps. It is a complete game except that it doesn&#39;t contain any Alien Warrior Miniatures (the seller was clear and honest about this and it was a reduced price).</p> <p>I&#39;m looking at getting the Alien Warriors pack but I noticed that it only contains 12 Alien Warrior Miniatures when a complete core game set would have had 16 Alien Warrior Miniatures.</p> <p>For those of you who have played the game, should I buy two packs of Alien Warrior Miniatures (to have 24 in total) or will 12 be enough? What&#39;s the most Alien Warrior Minis you&#39;ve had on the board at once? The fact that a core game includes 16 Alien Warriors makes me feel like you need a minimum of 16 Alien Warriors for the best game experience, and getting only 12 won&#39;t be enough!</p> <p>Thank you all in advance.</p> <p>I LOVE the corps!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt

The asymmetrical sunrise/character powers get my gears turning before the game even starts, the limited actions per round make every wheelbarrow placement feel precious, and watching the other players at the table claim their actions (while crossing your fingers that they don’t take the spot you’ve got your eye on) will make you sweat bullets.
