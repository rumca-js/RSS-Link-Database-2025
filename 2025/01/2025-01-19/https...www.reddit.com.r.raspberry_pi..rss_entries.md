<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hoping someone has dealt with this. I have a Pi4 with a touch screen that I’ve been using as a home assistant dashboard. When I first configured it, it worked more like a tablet than a desktop, i.e. I could scroll by dragging my finger and there was no mouse pointer. </p> <p>Then it asked me to do an update to the system that configures how the windows are drawn I guess? I don’t remember if this was a Wayland update or something similar. </p> <p>After it did that update, the cursor won’t go away and it doesn’t allow me to scroll by dragging a finger anymore. </p> <p>I’ve googled a ton about this. I’m not able to find anyone having the same problem. There’s a lot of old DIY guides about how to configure what I want, but I shouldn’t have to do this if it worked out of the box right? Any advice would be appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ManInWoods452"> /u/ManInWoods452 </a> <br/> <span><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>With the Raspberry Pi Zero being such a game-changer for compact, low-cost projects, it’s hard not to imagine what the next version could bring. Here’s my dream wish-list for the next Pi Zero—let me know if you agree or what you’d add!</p> <ol> <li><strong>2GB RAM:</strong> This would literally be a gamechanger to have own server for self-hosting.</li> <li><strong>At Least Two USB-C Ports:</strong> One for power and the other for HID or data transfer. Say goodbye to micro USB cables and adapters. And optional LAN port.</li> <li><strong>Better Thermal Management:</strong> Improved heat dissipation for sustained performance without throttling. The whole Pi zero board gets hot making other parts vulnerable to damage.</li> <li><strong>More Power Efficiency:</strong> This would be perfect for IoT and battery-powered projects where power conservation is key.</li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi 6E:</strong> Faster, more reliable wireless connectivity for modern networks
