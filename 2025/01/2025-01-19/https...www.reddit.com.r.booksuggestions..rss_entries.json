I love her and her books! Especially The Carrow Haunt and The Haunting of Blackwood House. The only problem is I only have 1 book left of her ghost stories! Coates&#39; work is my first foray into the genre. Does anyone have a good recommendation for an author or a book that has similar vibes? Particularly ghost stories or haunted houses.

She adored six of crows. She had the idea that we could start a book club together. Love the idea now only need suggestions because I don&#39;t know. I love old classics (austen, bronte sisters, dickens, stoker, etc), newer classics (hemingway, how to kill a mockingbird, like the writing style of gabriel garcia marquez). I really liked the hunger games, twilight when I was young. Liked the acotar series and love a house of salt and sorrows. </p> <p>Since she is 12 I have to buy the books for us both. So I would like to know some older books that are cheaper. I can&#39;t really afford to buy books that are \u20ac25+ each every month. She really wants to read at the same time and I love that idea but financially it&#39;s not happening with the new releases she would like to read.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I just finished the Earth\u2019s Children series (Jean M. Auel; Clan of the Cave Bear, etc.), which I found very comforting and hard to break loose from, but now that it\u2019s over I don\u2019t know what to do or where to go from here. I\u2019m fascinated by Paleolithic/early human material, but the online consensus seems to be that the Earth\u2019s Children series is the only successfully serious attempt at this niche sub-genre of historical fiction. And out of reverence to that series, I don\u2019t really want to chance any others that may purport to be similar.</p> <p>I need an entirely new adventure to set out on in a completely different direction.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations - preferably very long, and perhaps in a series - I\u2019m quite open to anything.</p> <p>Thank you all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Publius654",
