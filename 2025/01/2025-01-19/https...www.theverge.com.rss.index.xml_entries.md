  <p id="1mxQka">At a victory rally the day before being sworn into the presidency, Donald Trump extolled his plan to “save TikTok” from the law that banned it through a joint venture with the US. </p>
<p id="Efqu3Q">On its face, the plan does not appear to comply with the law’s requirements for a qualified divestiture that TikTok’s service providers like Apple, Google, and Oracle <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347325/tiktok-service-providers-penalties-apple-google-orcale-trump">could rely on to avoid hundreds of billions in potential fines</a>.

  <p id="ULJ0Vw">TikTok has returned — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347280/tiktok-ban-shutdown-ends">at least partially</a> — in the US following a nationwide ban, but other popular ByteDance-owned apps, such as the digital card game <em>Marvel Snap</em>, video editing app CapCut, and the social platform Lemon8, are still blocked. None of these apps, including TikTok, are currently available to download on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, either.</p>
<p id="Sur0gC">Though many users expected CapCut and Lemon8 to be affected by the law banning TikTok, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347034/marvel-snap-banned-tiktok-bytedance"><em>Marvel Snap</em>’s ban</a> took
