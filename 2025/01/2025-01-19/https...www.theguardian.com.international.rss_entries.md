<p>Some analysts fear ballooning federal debt and a bullish stock market means ‘something will surely snap’</p><p>Donald Trump’s return to the White House on Monday has the world economy on tenterhooks. Could the 47th US president govern broadly as he did last time, when his most extreme threats were ultimately softened? Or is this time different?</p><p>Corporate America’s biggest beasts have cosied up to the president-elect, but there are also serious jitters on Wall Street, amid investor fears that Trump’s most colourful campaign rhetoric will soon become a reality: risking a fresh inflation shock in the world’s largest economy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/19/trump-versus-the-bond-market-president-elects-campaign-rhetoric-puts-investors-on-edge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Collection of seven shorts due out in 2025 tells story of conflict from perspective of animals</p><p>The occupying Russian soldiers paid little attention to the elderly woman shuffling through the farmland surrounding the villages outside Kyiv, taking her goat to pasture. But she was focused closely on them. After locating their positions, she headed back home with the goat, and later called her grandson, a soldier in the Ukrainian army, to give the coordinates.</p><p>The story is one of seven episodes, based on real events from the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion but lightly fictionalised, that make up a feature film about the war in Ukraine, due out later this year. All seven of the shorts have one thing in common: they tell the story of the conflict from the perspective of animals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/19/animals-can-feel-good-and-evil-film-puts-new-perspective-on-ukraine-war">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russian-born UK citizen and Tory party activist Sergei Cristo fought to make MI5 sit up and take notice of the Russian political interference operation now threatening democracy in Britain – and around the world</p><p>In the dark days of the spring in 2022, as Russian troops terrorised Bucha and every day brought shocking new scenes of Ukrainians fleeing for their lives, I rang an old acquaintance, Sergei Cristo. Cristo is a Russian-born British citizen and I prepared for what I suspected might be a long conversation: he is a talker. He was born in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, but he moved to Britain when he was 19 and it’s fair to say we’re not the most obvious of allies. He loves the royal family and is a passionate Conservative party activist. He used to be on the committee of a donor club for young Conservatives, “and then I became vice-chairman, I knew the cabinet, I knew the leader, everybody”.</p><p>He’s not kidding. He has photos of himself with everyone from Margaret

<p>As hair-loss treatments improve, one wonders if we’ll start to get nostalgic for a good combover</p><p>It is with mixed emotions that I announce the end of baldness. Rest in pates, old friend. This year will see the very last generation of men who, having arrived at the threshold of their 30s, are forced to accept the loss of their hair, with all their future sons and grandsons nipping instead to Turkey for a little implant and some kofta. Gone today, hair tomorrow.</p><p>It’s true, look around. Compared with the Sean Connerys and Bruce Willises of yore, the number of bald celebrities on screen today can be counted on a single fist. The surgical technology has evolved, the transplants have become more accessible, the preventative drugs have improved, the death of bald is nigh. Like combovers, the hair plugs bring their own acts of faith of course, with hairlines so straight and thick it appears sometimes as if they are creeping down the face at night like a mask – every time I see

## Despite the eulogies, the postwar order did little for peace – and fuelled the rise of populism | Kenan Malik

<p>Don’t rush to mourn the end of a liberal international order that too often put order before liberalism</p><p>The historian <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/dam/ucp/books/pdf/course_intro/978-0-226-39834-1-intro.pdf">Steven Shapin</a> opened his account of <em>The Scientific Revolution</em> with the line: “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.” It is tempting to say much the same about the “liberal international order” (LIO), that “there is no such thing as the liberal international order and there are hundreds of books about it”. And this column, too.</p><p>There was a Scientific Revolution. And there has been since the Second World War a global framework that has helped order international relations. But whether that framework can be described as “liberal” or embodies what champions of the LIO claim it does – “an open world connected by the free flow of people, goods, ideas and capital” that was, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/20

<p>The elegant towns of Cascais, Estoril and Sintra have plenty to offer, from romantic royal palaces to the best of Portuguese cuisine</p><p>On a blue-sky Saturday morning, I joined a foraging hike in Sintra-Cascais nature park, a former municipal wasteland and now thriving ecosystem on the outskirts of Cascais in Portugal. Progress was deliciously slow, thanks to our passionate guide – ecologist Fernanda Botelho, Portugal’s foremost herbalist and wild forager. We’d barely made it out of the park’s welcome centre when she lunged at a bush and held a spiky leaf ahoy.</p><p>“Sow thistle,” she proclaimed. “Pigs love it. It’s good for salads, but it too often gets confused with the dandelion.” Everything has its uses, she said, from pine needles for sauces and honey to ash trees for flour and berries of the Peruvian Pink Pepper tree – “planted as an ornamental tree, but it combines very well with chocolate”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jan/19/culinary-adventure-

## A Complete Unknown review – Timothée Chalamet radiates charisma in evocative Dylan biopic

<p>James Mangold’s handsome portrait of the enigmatic singer’s stratospheric early career boasts a barnstorming lead performance yet often slips into heavy-handedness</p><p>It’s a remarkable performance. Star of the moment Timothée Chalamet inhabits the loose-limbed, live-wire physicality of the young Bob Dylan and makes an impressively good fist of capturing the frayed hessian of his distinctive voice. Acoustic guitars are plucked and harmonicas honked with the effortless fluency of someone who learned to play almost before they could walk. Chalamet’s Dylan sucks so fervently on his cigarettes it’s as though he’s breathing in the genius of the musical heroes who came before him. But while he radiates insouciant charisma and channels the once-in-a-lifetime talent, he reveals next to nothing about Dylan as a person. This is not necessarily a failure in Chalamet’s acting. It’s a deliberate choice – the film is called <em>A Complete Unknown</em>, after all, and it’s a manifesto as much
