<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings everyone,</p> <p>I just bought a HiFive Rev b board, hoping that I would be able to experiment some stuff with it, but I spent a lot of hours trying to figure out how to code this board with C++. I downloaded the Freedom Studio IDE, but there I was only able to code it using C.<br/> I had a look on multiple documentation posted by SiFive, but I wasn&#39;t able to find anything regarding how to code this board with C++.<br/> Could anyone please guide me, or perhaps share some documentation or videos the demonstrates how to do so.<br/> I really appreciate the help from everyone :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Event155"> /u/Alternative_Event155 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i588ug/can_you_code_hifive_revb_board_using_c/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i588ug/can_you_code_hifive_revb_board_u

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying out a new business case, so at the moment I&#39;m at the researching phase. I want to manufacture a small PCB capable of running low powered software. Hardware wise it&#39;s pretty much the exact same as the NanoKVM boards, which runs Linux off an SD card, gets power via USB-C, and has ethernet. I would like to expand the device with WiFi as well, even though it might increase the footprint of the device by a lot. The Sipeed chips are really nice, but also quite expensive and hard to buy individually, unfortunately. Also, their recent drama means it&#39;s probably hard to even source them for mass production.</p> <p>The software that needs to be run, is not that demanding. I prefer virtualization via Docker, but I know that&#39;s probably a reach on such a small device. 128MB RAM is way more than enough.</p> <p>I want these devices to be cheap for the customers, which means stuff like a Raspberry Pi is way out of the picture. I&#39;m t

## Are Bus Errors recoverable?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The spec says &quot;Precise PMA traps might not always be possible, for example, when probing a legacy bus architecture that uses access failures as part of the discovery mechanism. In this case, error responses from slave devices will be reported as imprecise bus-error interrupts&quot;</p> <p>What does the discovery mechanism here mean? Does it mean software does a load to a memory region to see if it exists? If it&#39;s not precise, how can software deal with it? </p> <p>Also, if load bus errors are also treated as imprecise, does that mean all bus errors are irrecoverable? Is there use cases for making load bus errors precise and recoverable? </p> <p>Beginner to these kind of stuff, so some examples or reference would be helpful. Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pokemaster2213"> /u/pokemaster2213 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i4swub/are_bus_errors_r
