I've often heard the name Devin Townsend mentioned - but mainly by musicians I know. The man is prolific and a legend in the industry. So I've gone back to the title track of his last album - PowerNerd - to find out more; it's the tiny tip of a very big iceberg. 

To watch the track in full (copyright meant we had to edit it back), visit: https://youtu.be/8-we4aXo_NM?si=1dabhVA9pnUcHFxq
