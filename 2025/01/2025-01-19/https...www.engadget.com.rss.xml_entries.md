<p>It’s been unclear in the leadup to the TikTok ban what the fate of parent company ByteDance’s other apps would be, but now we know: they’ve gone dark in the US too. At the same time <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-no-longer-available-in-the-us-040204115.html" data-original-link="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-no-longer-available-in-the-us-040204115.html">TikTok went offline this weekend</a>, so did other apps ByteDance has developed or is affiliated with, including the popular video-editing tool CapCut, the social media platform Lemon8 and <em>Marvel Snap. </em>All are now displaying messages to US users that their services are unavailable. <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@benbrode/post/DE_xr9BxCu2?xmt=AQGznZSpxsOmmUsk6ceVxKkQ1_D7ZNhm2A2N39BOuQBeNw" data-original-li

<p>The switch has flipped on the TikTok ban. TikTok's app stoped working and was removed from the App Store and Google Play on Saturday night just hours before the January 19, ban was set to take effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who have previously installed the app were instead greeted with a pop-up. "Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now," it says. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that president Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The notice gives users the option to close the app or "learn more," which directs to a page on TikTok's website with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.tiktok.com/us-landing">similar language</a>. Existing users can also download their data from the website.&nbsp;</p>
