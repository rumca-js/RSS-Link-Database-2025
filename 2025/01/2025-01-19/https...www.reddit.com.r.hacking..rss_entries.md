<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If someone were to physically obtain a SIM card, then how much time would it take to clone it? I was watching a few videos and read a articles on common misconceptions about SIM card cloning. </p> <p>Could it be done in let’s say 25 minutes? Or would it take much longer? Also, do you need to physically obtain the card or could you just use the sim ID or IMEI of the phone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Moneyisessential"> /u/Moneyisessential </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i4m42j/how_fastlong_does_it_take_to_clone_a_sim_card/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1i4m42j/how_fastlong_does_it_take_to_clone_a_sim_card/">[comments]</a></span>
