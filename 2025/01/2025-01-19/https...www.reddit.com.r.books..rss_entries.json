He survives but is blinded by the attempt. I think it was implied he shot himself to escape his domineering mother. obviously, and after he became blind, he has to move in with her so she can care for him. </p> <p>Then the story begins, and my memory fades.</p> <p>But <em>The Women&#39;s Room</em> seized me.

I imagine there is that one book with which one succeeds in forming a deep connection unlike any other. A book that allows a person to experience this unique sense that somebody &quot;gets&quot; me understands what I&#39;ve been through and view of the world.</p> <p>Another way of saying it is that after you read a &quot;soul mate book,&quot; you have this strange thought that the book was written based on your life or written for you in particular.</p> <p>I must confess I have yet to find that book but a couple of times I came close. Crime and Punishment, for example, seemed to be written for my tortured soul and spoke to my sense of alienation and questions about whether my life has any meaning. But I did not share some of the main character&#39;s philosophical views and willingness to do some extreme things. So I resumed my search for my soul mate....</p>",

Cool. What I did not expect was the amount of feminism or misogyny involved in it.</p> <p>As someone whos is very out of the loop with this topic, the characters feel a lot less relatable than say, Raskolnikov (Crime and Punishment) or even Arkady (The Adolescent). As if jumping in blind into 1800s Russian literature wasn&#39;t confounding enough with the regional and generational gap.</p> <p>I genuinely feel bad for the double standards that we men set on the women. There was one chapter where the male romantic partner(?) told the female main character that it is different when guys gain weight VS when a woman gains weight.

Pierce Brown sets the stage for what could have been an interesting political space-opera at the start of the book. But then the story just turns into hunger games in space. (Don&#39;t get me wrong I liked hunger games when it came out but I was expecting a bit more from this). I&#39;ve the heard the series no longer follows YA tropes and becomes much more dark and intense with a lot of politics from the second book onwards so fingers crossed for that.</p> <p>My rating : 3.5/5</p> <p>(A good book but definitely a bit derivative imo)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Risb1005\"> /u/Risb1005 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i4rpan/red_rising_1_is_a_good_start_to_from_what_ive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bo",
