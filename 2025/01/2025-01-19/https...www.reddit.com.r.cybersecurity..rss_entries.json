I&#39;m trying to get a start in Cybersecurity\u2014specifically more on the Defensive/Analytical side of things\u2014but I have no idea where to really go from here. I&#39;ve always wanted to do stuff like this (ever since I was little!) but I really only know how to program, and this stuff has to do with the things WAY underneath all that. I know that I need to understand everything about hardware, software, and networking, but I have no idea where to start. For extra context, I&#39;m currently in college for Cybersecurity, but those classes don&#39;t start until my second Sophmore term, and I&#39;m trying to at least get some kind of knowledge under my belt before then. I do really well with following lists in chronological order, but anything works :]! </p> <p>Many thanks! I hope to come back to this place in the future and actually understand what&#39;s going on, haha.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

Over the past few days, I&#39;ve been searching for videos, books, and courses to learn the basics of compliance, but I&#39;m feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. Can anyone recommend resources or share advice on building a solid foundation in compliance?
