<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Game designer Sam Barlow deserves a lot of credit for driving the “redemption” of FMVs. The full-motion video game format was pioneered in the early ’90s as a cutting-edge visual technique in an age when computer graphics were more simplistic.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none"><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length machinima, made entirely in-game in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24101246/gta-online-community-gta-6-limbo-role-play"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>. It’s also a slapstick comedy of errors about three friends trying to fill an empty period in their lives by staging a production of William Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> inside this chaotic online space. It’s a strange, funny, and even poignant film that takes place in a dreamlike space between gaming and theater.</p>
