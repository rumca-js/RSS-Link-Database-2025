<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Me personally, I&#39;ll be going to some LGBT events and clubs on campus to surround myself with community and have people to talk to about what to do going forward. Probably also gonna bury myself in art and music looking for things with protest and anti-fascist themes. I&#39;m also trying to see if there&#39;s anything I can do in terms of community organization to fight back against the shitty laws we know are coming. I&#39;d be lying if I said it&#39;s not daunting or a little bit scary to be taking such a bold stance when I usually prefer being quiet and sitting in the background, but I can&#39;t just sit by and do nothing, and honestly, having <em>some</em> kind of plan in place, even a loosely defined one, helps to stop some of the panic and despair I&#39;d otherwise drown in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-GreyRaven"> /u/-GreyRaven </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt

I don&#39;t see very much hope out there, but that could be because social media is full of negativity. It seems like hate is growing, and that&#39;s terrifying. I&#39;m deeply afraid of things getting worse, and I don&#39;t know if I can handle that.</p> <p>I was really just wondering if there is hope out there that I just can&#39;t see? Am I just catastrophizing? Will we make it through? Etc. </p> <p>You all know much more than I do. Please reach out if you can.

There is already a shitload of Homophobia and Transphobia on the app, and it‚Äôs in the rules itself.

Instagram is barely any better but at least you won‚Äôt get banned for posting about being LGBTQ / Trans. Why sacrifice your integrity and rights to be openly Gay / Trans to get a quick shorts fix? I assume it‚Äôs younger LGBTQ people who are addicted to shorts content, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any better nor is it an excuse.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am scared and I want to do something to fight against all of the extreme bigotry coming from the internet and various governments recently. But I have no idea what to actually do. In the long run I want to find ways to educate people, and to maybe get into politics to try to fight to protect queer rights, and various other rights that are in jeopardy. But I can&#39;t do that for a long time, and so I feel so helpless right now. I don&#39;t know what I can do right now, and I hate just sitting here and listening to everything fall apart.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BadAtUsernames098"> /u/BadAtUsernames098 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1i4lp3k/what_can_we_do_to_help_protect_lgbtqia_rights/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1i4lp3k/what_can_we_do_to_help_protect_lgbtqia_rights/">[comments]</a></span>
