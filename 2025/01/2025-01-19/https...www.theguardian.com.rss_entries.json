Beware the angry golfer. Say what you like about Tyrrell Hatton\u2019s frequent tantrums \u2013 and plenty do \u2013 but the Englishman\u2019s ability can never be called into question. Hatton will surge back into the top 10 of the world on account of his Dubai Desert Classic victory, with a Ryder Cup return at Bethpage this year already looking a formality.</p><p>Many have disappeared from view after switching to LIV Golf. Hatton, by contrast, can still mix it with the best. This marks his second DP World Tour success since joining the rebel circuit in early 2024. Even the emergence of Rory McIlroy from the Sunday shadows was insufficient to knock Hatton off stride at the Emirates Club.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/19/tyrrell-hatton-dubai-desert-victory-world-top-10\">Continue reading...</a>",

To alleviate common injuries, it\u2019s time to get to know them </p><p>Killer abs, beefy biceps and perky pecs are classic signifiers of strong, well-exercised bodies, but not many people walk into a gym with a goal of building up their teres minor. This more low-key muscle, along with several others, is often underappreciated and weak, even among fitness fans. Neglecting such muscles as the teres minor can cause overuse of other muscles to compensate, or a lack of stability around a joint, which can lead to common painful injuries. And as anyone currently in musculo-skeletal pain knows all too well, it\u2019s preferable to build up these forgotten muscles before you end up on the physiotherapist\u2019s waiting list with an agonising shoulder, hip or lower back.

There have been periods of many years when I was monogamous, 10 years in particular during which our two children were born.

I know I\u2019ve damaged him with my behaviour, and that he feels inadequate, but I long for him to agree to marry me. I\u2019ve proposed more than once, but he\u2019s declined on account of my infidelity. Other than this issue, he makes life perfect for me and our family. I wish he knew how much he means to me, but I worry one day he\u2019s just going to leave. How can I fix this?</em></p><p><em><strong>Phi",
