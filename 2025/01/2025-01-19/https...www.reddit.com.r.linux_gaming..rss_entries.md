This also sometimes happens when the laptop goes into sleep mode, but not consistently...</p> <p>I&#39;ve narrowed down the problem to Nvidia&#39;s power profiles, nvidia-smi sometimes shows the power limit as 60W and utilization 100%, and sometimes power limit as 180W but power draw nowhere near that and utilization 50%.</p> <p>But there are no power settings in nvidia-settings in Wayland. I&#39;ve read that Nvidia is working on Wayland support in posts dated 2021, has there been no progress? Is there no alternative?</p> <p>GreenWithEnvy doesn&#39;t work with Wayland either, setting profile to performance in asusctl (I have an ASUS laptop) doesn&#39;t fix it, and tuxclocker fails to set power limit</p> </di

After a crash while playing (and I do not recall, but I guess also a yay -Syu) I had my computer pretty much unbootable.</p> <p>I tried to chroot and check if I could solve it with an upgrade but did not solve it. Then I tried to install LTS kernel and try to boot but still nothing. Downgraded (with downgrade) Nvidia drivers but still nothing. Fresh install or even trying different distros with Nvidia ready drivers (PopOS and Ubuntu) but again, nothing. Heck even with noveau drivers I get random freezes from time to time.</p> <p>Anyway, now I manage to boot more or less consistently with nvidia-open 565.77 (I was using nvidia/nvidia-dkms but I saw now it is recommended to use the new driver with open source modules) and 6.12 kernel. However, second monitor gets a random frozen image everytime I boot. I checked my journalctl log, and I see this error:</p> <p>Jan 19 22:07:32 xeonchinorris kwin_wayland[866]:

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone here think that the release of SteamOS (and its potential popularity) could help with the current gaming problems like anti-cheat issues on Linux desktop? I started thinking about this because, at the launch of the Steam Deck i wasn&#39;t expecting many changes, but I felt that Valve made at least a 5-year leap in Linux gaming. With Proton, I can play almost everything nowadays. So, I’d like to hear opinions on whether SteamOS could have a similar effect or if it seems unlikely.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Necropill"> /u/Necropill </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i516pf/about_steamos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1i516pf/about_steamos/">[comments]</a></span>
