It\u2019s no doubt a very beautifully written, imaginative set of stories that center on a few main themes: Budapest throughout time, the suppression and control of art, art as liberation and transcendence, Eastern Europe under Communist control, cancer and dying, prejudice in small Southern towns, and a strange woman named Miss Grey who mysteriously arrives to help children in need. I personally prefer my dreamy, atmospheric fantasy to be set in secondary worlds as opposed to our world, but I think my main quibble with this collection is that a few too many stories left me thinking \u201cOh, that\u2019s it?\u201d at the end. That\u2019s bound to happen with a few stories per each collection, but my favorite short story collections have more gems than duds in their ratio.

It is very confusing but the intrigue keeps me going for sure. I\u2019m just wondering do the timelines get easier to follow as the series progresses? Sometimes it feels like it has a flashback or a completely different scene in the middle of a chapter and I get insanely confused for a second. I found out that Mark Lawrence doesn\u2019t visualize his books while he\u2019s writing them because he has something called aphantasia. While I think it\u2019s incredible that he\u2019s able to write a vivid world like this without being able to see it himself I feel like sometimes things in here are hard for me myself to visualize but are still cool in concept.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not suggesting that female characters shouldn\u2019t have any flaws or anything, but I\u2019m just tired of reading about a ruthless killing machines who doesn\u2019t give a shit about anyone except her two friends because the rest world took everything from her or whatever. Or another thing authors will do is that they\u2019ll make the character to random shitty things just so they can be called an anti-hero, because I guess that\u2019s what sells rn. </p> <p>Any recommendations for stories with a female protagonist who\u2019s empathetic and actually gives a shit about t",

In the past he&#39;s told me he likes to read fantasy books because he can just check his worries at the door and immerse himself in dragons and whatever. So I want to slip one into the care package I&#39;m putting together for his family. Admittedly, I&#39;m an English teacher, but not a fantasy fan (sorry! I&#39;ve tried!), so I don&#39;t know where to start for adult fantasy. I would ask him, but he&#39;s very overwhelmed with all the things right now and he&#39;s not going to want to put together a list of ideas. So please! Help me out! What might be a fantasy/dragon book for a 43yo husband/dad who&#39;s educated and works in academia (fundraising) and is working to hold it all together? Maybe something that he might not have already read? Or maybe a classic that someone might want to read again?Any ideas? Thank you!\ud83d\ude4f ",
