        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So after having asked another question here about the Risk! series and people saying that there are actually a lot of better games, I started digging even more and found with the help of suggestions: 1) Inis 2) Kemet 3) Acquire</p> <p>All of those games seemed insanely good, especially Inis, but when i saw the price tag gawddamn I didn\u2019t expect that. So should\u2019ve said right in the beginning, i\u2019ve never played any other board game besides Monopoly and so I also expected the prices to be around 20-40\u20ac. But hell nah those are actually ~100\u20ac, and my teenage ahh can\u2019t afford them at all.</p> <p>So my question is a lot more generic this time: What are your favourite 2-4 player games, that aren\u2019t too expensive? (Important note, I really want those games to be equally interesting played in 2 or in 4) The genre doesn\u2019t really matter, even tho if you got something similar to Inis or Acquire it would be great, but i\u2019m pretty sure games with as much stuff inside",

Even on the contention games official website, they dont ship it here!

I love dungeon crawler and roguelite board games like Too many bones so thats why i kinda gravitate to both of the games mentioned! </p> <p>Any help or thoughts is greatly appreciated!

It struck me that the rules never really give example on how to use &quot;cunning&quot; or &quot;diplomatic&quot; strategies. There are specific rules for deals, if main players both play negotiation cards. But there isn&#39;t any rules what so ever for the &quot;table talk&quot; part of the game - which I read is a huge part of why the game is so popular.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;ve read a bunch of posts on reddit already and I realize people make alliances and perhaps declares intentions to negotiate and then backstep the defense with an attack card.
