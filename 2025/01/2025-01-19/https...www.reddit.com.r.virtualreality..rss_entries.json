In my case, this was not be true.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using the Quest 3 pretty much since its release as my main PCVR sim racing headset. I love that with the FOV multiplier, I can get a solid 120Hz in any game, which unfortunately, no native DisplayPort HMD offers.</p> <p>However, something always felt a bit off. I could not achieve completely smooth fluidity. I&#39;m very sensitive to any type of frame drops or late frame delivery, and what I noticed with the Quest was that every now and then, maybe once or twice every 30 seconds, something felt off. The best way I can describe it is that I was seeing either a frame duplication or a missed frame, resulting in a very brief stutter. This was most noticeable in sharp corners where frames differ significantly. Sometimes I also heard a crack in the built-in speakers.",

One little problem tho: every 3-5 minutes, FPS drops like crazy and latency and networking spikes up a lot, for about 5 seconds, then it goes back to normal. Every game works fine even with ultra settings at both 90 or 72 fps. Note that I\u2019m currently using a quest 2 with medium preset and max bitrate.</p> <p>Anyone knows a fix for this? Might be AMD? (Driver ver: 24.12.1)</p> <p><strong>edit</strong>: tried with any kind of bitrate lower than max value (yes, even 10) and it didn&#39;t change a thing. Even tried dynamic bitrate and still nothing.<br/> Lowering the bitrate seems to have fixed the issue only on VTOL vr tho, and i might know why: to resolve another kind of stuttering problem I was experiencing, I&#39;ve changed the startup option of the game to make it run on OpenXR, and it runs perfect",

Then I learned that Skyrim isn&#39;t compatible with the PSVR2, only the PSVR1 which would seem like a waste to get now. </p> <p>Then I learned about this insanely fun looking game which isn&#39;t available on PSVR at all: Blade and Sorcery. This suddenly became the game I wanna play the most. Meaning I would have to get a headset and not be able to use any PS games with it. There really aren&#39;t that many that I currently feel I&#39;d be missing out on, basically only No Man&#39;s Sky since I can&#39;t play Skyrim. </p> <p>Note: I have a PC but it&#39;s over 10 years old.

I&#39;ve played through the tutorial so far and am very impressed!</p> <p>However I just wanted to ask about the water. It seems from the tutorial that water is going to be a fairly prominent theme in the game. My issue is that I have a ridiculous phobia of being in water - yes, even in VR - and this can be quite off-putting for me. In the tutorial, I hardened up and dove in when I realised I absolutely needed to, then had a mini heart attack when I spotted the fellas swimming around there (until I figured they were friendly). By the end, I was on edge and anxiety levels were up, but I managed to swim around a bit to collect the hidden items, and actually was able to appreciate the atmosphere.</p> <p>W",

In this time, I was able to measure the FOV of the device with both WIMFOV and Risa2000 HMDQ. I&#39;ll link these below, but first, I&#39;ll give a quick overview of my experience with the device.</p> <p>Comfort:<br/> This is typically my top priority in a VR HMD, odd to say I know, but I spend a lot of time in VR, and comfort is a top priority. As far as weight goes, the Superlight 8K does just fine in this regard. However, the strap isn&#39;t very comfortable, and puts a certain amount of pressure on the forehead. It also produces a small amount of heat, which, while it didn&#39;t bother me, is noticeable and could be problematic for some. The facial interface as well is not very comfortable, and slips around in ways I don&#39;t really like. The lack of a top strap, as well, is noticeable and in my opinion a definite requirement.</p> <p>Di",
