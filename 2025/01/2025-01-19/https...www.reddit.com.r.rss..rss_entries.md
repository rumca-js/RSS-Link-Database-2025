<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Following on from my previous post in this Subreddit, I have been using OpenRSS to create a feed for a webpage that didn’t have one. </p> <p>It is working, but I’m finding it rather slow (often takes 24hrs to find new items) and I’m wondering if anyone can recommend an alternative service?</p> <p>I’m willing to use a paid service or self hosted if required. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kevmarl"> /u/kevmarl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i4l4zi/alternative_to_openrss/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i4l4zi/alternative_to_openrss/">[comments]</a></span>
