<p>A vulnerable son. A hostile takeover. Clunes’ Welsh farmer has quite enough on his plate – and that’s before the drug gangs force him to pick up his firearm</p><p>Over the last few weeks, ITV has been heavily trailing Out There with a teaser that positions it as a cross between Happy Valley, Countryfile and the Liam Neeson revenge thriller Taken. Martin Clunes plays Nathan Williams, a Welsh farmer whose vulnerable son Johnny is manipulated into becoming part of a county lines drug-running operation. It is soaked in an Ozark-blue wash of colour, and in its opening moments looks set to emerge as a bleak slice of nasty rural noir.</p><p>But beneath the topsoil, Out There is far more steady-handed than you might have anticipated, if, like me, you had been quite looking forward to watching Doc Martin do his best “I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you” impersonation. Nathan is a sole parent, following the death of his French wife Sabine a couple of years earlier. Thei

She had recognised the growing importance of the rights of the customer in the booming Britain of the 1960s and on arrival in the House of Commons in 1970 immediately set about making the subject her own.</p><p>She was a bright, brash, assertive woman who made full use of three years’ Rada training for the stage and who was famed for an eye-catching wardrobe, wrist-rattling jewellery and a large helmet of blond hair that would not have been out of place on the set of Dallas. She knew what she wanted and set out to get it, and having decided on a political career (early marriage and motherhood having put paid to acting), she took advice on how to proceed.</p> <a

<p>The third book from the twice Pulitzer prize-nominated American author is a complex portrait of parallel lives on a par with the great Russian novels</p><p>Adam Haslett is one of those incandescently smart and elegant authors that the US seems to produce almost accidentally and to excess, names who haven’t quite risen to international literary stardom, but perhaps deserve to: think Jonathan Dee, Garth Risk Hallberg, Lauren Groff or Claire Messud. Haslett’s brilliant debut novel, <em>Union Atlantic</em>, looked into the bleak moral heart of the 2007-8 financial crisis. His second, <em>Imagine Me Gone</em>, was a meditation on fatherhood and depression. Now, with <em>Mothers and Sons</em>, he has written a book that circles around an absence: the alienation of a son – Peter, a lawyer in his 40s – from his mother, Ann, who runs an “intentional community”, a women’s retreat in the hills of Vermont.</p><p>This is a novel about practice. Chapter by chapter, we move from Peter’s world in

<p><strong>Pavilion, Glasgow</strong><br>The Los Angeles musician is developing a heavier, rockier sound than before, but her astonishing voice and intuitive melodies are as strong as ever </p><p>Sat with her back to the audience, Madison Cunningham is performing an eerie, unreleased ballad, her white dress mirrored in a glossy black upright piano. The theatre is pin-drop silent as the California singer-songwriter’s astonishing voice, classic and characterful, pours into a heavily reverbed microphone.</p><p>“That was a funny way to say hello,” she grins afterwards. The “pitch” for this one-off show, part of Celtic Connections festival, she tells us, is that it will comprise almost entirely new songs, from a record not yet announced. It’s a bold gambit – usually fans come to hear the songs they know – but Cunningham has a winning confidence in her rich, complex new material, and how it develops her sound. One song, with a restless piano melody that echoes Joni Mitchell, slips organica

Just about all of them are centred on older people, the pressures on financially broken local councils from an ageing society and people having to sell their homes to pay for residential care. All these things, of course, are urgent and hugely significant – but they exclude a huge part of society for whom care is just as important. The reason why that happens is not hard to work out: it reflects a set of ingrained, almost Victorian prejudices – and, without wanting to sound too melodramatic, the last frontier of the struggle for human rights.</p><p>Just under <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-an

Set in the months after the 2014 landslide victory of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s rightwing Bharatiya Janata party (here fictionalised as the Bharat party), the book tunes into the hopes and anxieties of a knot of spirited young individuals, as they navigate caste, class, selfhood, ambition and pride amid the rising tide of Hindu nationalism.</p><p>Among them is 31-year-old management consultant Naren Agashe who is back home in Mumbai, after a decade spent in the US.

<p>This is a very English wonder, fusing the arcane symbolism of northern England with then modern ideas from Renaissance Italy</p><p>Bolsover Castle, topped with turrets, sits at the crest of a hill with the best view in Derbyshire. You could be forgiven for thinking it must be the home of a medieval knight, if not a wizard. But really it’s a gothic, chivalric, romantic recreation of a medieval castle, constructed by a 17th-century aristocrat. He was so pleased with his “new castle” that he took it for his title, becoming Duke of Newcastle.</p><p>The castle seems pretty wondrous to me, not least because it determined my choice of career. As a teenager, I read about it in a book describing a treasure hunt undertaken in the 1960s by the architectural historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Girouard">Mark Girouard</a>. He was looking for traces of the lost houses designed by the Smythsons, a talented family of master masons and designers in Elizabethan England. Their work

To alleviate common injuries, it’s time to get to know them </p><p>Killer abs, beefy biceps and perky pecs are classic signifiers of strong, well-exercised bodies, but not many people walk into a gym with a goal of building up their teres minor. This more low-key muscle, along with several others, is often underappreciated and weak, even among fitness fans. Neglecting such muscles as the teres minor can cause overuse of other muscles to compensate, or a lack of stability around a joint, which can lead to common painful injuries. And as anyone currently in musculo-skeletal pain knows all too well, it’s preferable to build up these forgotten muscles before you end up on the physiotherapist’s waiting list with an agonising shoulder, hip or lower back. Here are those elusive muscle groups to look out for.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/19/from-stiff-necks-to-lazy-gl

I have an ice-cold mango and passion fruit kombucha beside me and an agonising case of pins and needles. The solution to pins and needles, I learned a few years ago, is to directly confront the agony: pull your legs out from underneath you, bend your toes up as high as they can reach, and yes, it will hurt far more initially, but then the pain subsides. I’d like to do this very much, but sitting opposite me is a man – sitting all around me are men – and it is his turn to talk. He has eight minutes to tell us – all men, all strangers – what has been bothering him lately, or this week, or today, or for his entire lifetime, and right now he is on a

<p>When you’re presiding over a flatlining economy, every error is magnified and there is little credit for the things you’re doing right</p><p>Rachel Reeves was making her way to Prime Minister’s Questions when we bumped into each other last week. She is now routinely described as “embattled” or – even more dreaded label – “beleaguered”. So I thought it polite to ask how she was feeling. “I’m very well, actually,” she responded and hit me with a smile so wide and beaming that she could find alternative employment advertising toothpaste.</p><p>Being chancellor is not just a numbers game. It is as much, if not more, a confidence game. The chief financial officer can never afford to look rattled about the balance sheet or fretful about the vultures circling their position. The more reason they have to feel anxious, the more imperative it is that they look nerveless. That she understands. “It’s a tough gig, but there’s no one tougher than Rachel,” says one of her admirers in the cabinet

Back when this movement seemed full of potential, in 2018, Gaiman urged the public to believe women like Christine Blasey Ford, whose allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh were then being trashed.</p><p>“On a day like today it’s worth saying,” Gaiman wrote. “I believe survivors.

<p>The aggression from the Tesla billionaire is new; but Britain has years of experience in the consequences of falling for misleading promises</p><p>‘Never under­estimate the power of ignorance.” I came across this thought while looking for something to watch late at night after the television news on the horrors in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and the Los Angeles fires.</p><p>The quote comes from an old episode of my friend Paul Whitehouse’s <em>The Fast Show</em>. It applies, among many other things, to the background to the re-election of the criminal Donald Trump, and the continuing damage being wrought upon itself by a British electorate, 37% of whom voted, in frustration at other economic and social problems, for Brexit. With few exceptions they did not know what they were letting themselves in for; but they do now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/19/first-brexit-now-trump-and-musk-ignorance-is-back-with-a-vengeance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Belgian photographer’s 2012 image exemplifies his gift for connecting with animals on camera</p><p>Recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/12/horses-can-plan-ahead-and-think-strategically-scientists-find">research</a> into animal behaviour indicates that, contrary to the belief that horses only respond to stimuli in the moment, they have the ability to think ahead and plan their actions. The horse in this picture by Michel Vanden Eeckhoudt seems to have no urgent need for such strategic thinking. The mane of flaxen tresses, the loose ringlets of the tail, the languorous attitude, meadow flowers as far as the eye can see – Vanden Eeckhoudt’s horse seems to exist in a kind of pony club elysium, idly dreaming an afternoon away.</p><p>The Belgian-born photographer’s images of animals often invite you to imagine their subjects’ interior lives, though rarely is the vision as bucolic – or as apparently unperturbed – as this one.

<p>The first ever memoir by a living pope reveals a warm, emotionally intelligent man who loves football and ‘cutting-edge’ cinema – but skates over the more controversial parts of his career</p><p>Popes seldom lack a platform or a pulpit, so they have had little need to resort to autobiography to explain themselves. What books do appear under their names in recent decades have been either dull transcriptions of interviews with tame journalists that have been heavily vetted by the Vatican, or compilations of old sermons packaged as something more than they are.</p><p>I therefore approached this new volume with a certain weary caution and was pleasantly surprised. It fully justifies its bold claim to be the first ever memoir by a living pope. Indeed, Francis’s Italian ghostwriter, the publisher Carlo Musso, reveals in a brief afterword that the original plan when the book was commissioned in 2019 was that it would not appear until after his death. So why the sudden urgency?</p> <a hre

<p>Brooke Shields, sexualised child star at just 11, is no stranger to tabloid controversy. Now 59, perhaps now she can tell us how she ended up so… normal?</p><p>Brooke Shields was at a party, drifting off. The host, a small man with bare feet, was giving her a tour of his wine cellar and she was losing interest, if she’s being honest – which she is now as a matter of principle, after a lifetime of smiling politely and pretending everything’s fine. Her mind was wandering. They say wine gets better with age, she was thinking, “but isn’t there a moment when it turns to jam? And I said to him, ‘I’m 58 and I’m wondering if…’ I didn’t even get the rest of the sentence out before he said, ‘Oh, I wish you hadn’t told me that.’”</p><p>That’s curious, she replied. “I asked him, ‘Did my age make him older?’ I was interested in the psychology of it, that kneejerk reaction.” It was partly, she thinks, her fame – people imprint on a child star, and when they grow up they take it personally. “It

<p>Hardworking and complex, some beauty products can do more than one thing at once </p><p>These days, I have no energy for the steps a properly made-up face requires. Don’t get me wrong, I admire anyone wearing a painstakingly applied maquillage right now. But like I said, zero energy. “Ease” is my word for the month. A blusher that works on the lips, a tinted moisturiser with SPF, a face balm that also works as a bronzer and highlighter… While I’ve long decided we’ve been sold a lie about the benefits of multitasking – doing lots of things at once is inane and stressful – when it comes to makeup, the multitasker is the dream.</p><p><strong>1.

But when it comes to flavour, I can’t help but think in a similarly sense-jumbling way, with certain tastes or organoleptic sensations having strong associations with certain colours and visual effects. At this time of year, when the conditions outside incline to the murky and muted, and it’s easy to sink into grey lethargy, I start looking for ingredients that offer flashes of mood lifting brightness and colour: I get through a hell of a lot of ginger and chilli, and pile the fruit bowl high with blood oranges, limes and mandarins. I crave similar sensations in wine, too, which is one of the reasons why January is a riesling month for me, with th

Although he’s an attentive and selfless lover, he seldom interests me in that way and I still get an overwhelming kick from a one-night stand. I know I’ve damaged him with my behaviour, and that he feels inadequate, but I long for him to agree to marry me. I’ve proposed more than once, but he’s declined on account of my infidelity. Other than this issue, he makes life perfect for me and our family. I wish he knew how much he means to me, but I worry one day he’s just going to leave. How can I fix this?</em></p><p><em><strong>Phi
