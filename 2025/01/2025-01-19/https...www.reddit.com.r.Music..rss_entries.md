## What “classic” rock song have you grown tired to?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>You ever notice how some of those classic rock songs we all loved back in the day just don’t hit the same anymore? Don’t get me wrong, I grew up blasting Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and AC/DC like they were the soundtrack to my life. But now, some of those tunes feel more like background noise than the anthems they used to be. I think it’s because we’ve just heard them too much. When something plays over and over, it starts to lose that magic.</p> <p>Take “Back in Black,” for example. Great song, no doubt, but how many times can you hear it before you start rolling your eyes? It’s not that the song got worse; it’s just that it got overplayed. Classic rock radio stations stick to the same 50 songs like they’re afraid to dig deeper into the catalog. There’s so much great music out there, but they keep shoving “ Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Free Bird” in our ears like there’s nothing else worth hearing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obviously everyone’s definition of a star is different, but you know I mean. </p> <p>I adore R&amp;B and fell in love with Mariah the Scientist. The music is just SO good, I was certain she was on track to take over along the lines of SZA and Summer Walker and she just…hasn’t. Shes doing her thing and working, but the radio/chart presence is not there. Spread Thin and IDGAF were little hits, which I was thrilled about, but I still wish more people knew about her. </p> <p>I was also certain Maliibu Miitch was gonna be a heavyweight female rapper and last I heard she became a fashion nova model instead. Kind of a bummer. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wyldfyre-Quinn"> /u/Wyldfyre-Quinn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i4mwxe/artists_are_you_surprised_didnt_take_off/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1i4mwxe/artists_ar

## I think my favourite movement in 'Moonlight Sonata' is the 2nd one... But despite it's beauty, it is the least popular part...

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know that the 3rd Movement is objectively better, as it is more innovative and uses some unique patterns. It&#39;s relative speed, lenght and difficulty might also be a factor to its popularity.</p> <p>However, the 2nd Movement creates emotions that I never felt before. It is a gorgeous movement that gives a sense of peace and tranquility. The combination between notes are genius, and seems like they were made for each other. As others have described, it is the perfect connection between Mov.1 and Mov.2 • I think that most people see this movement as a bridge between both movements, but I find it more than that... It is the least performed movement of Moonlight Sonata. People who start playing classical music on piano tend to start by the 1st or 3rd movement, and completely forget about the 2nd... I have even seen people who have heard this magnificent song but had no idea of the existence of this movement, and that is quite sad, because it does de
