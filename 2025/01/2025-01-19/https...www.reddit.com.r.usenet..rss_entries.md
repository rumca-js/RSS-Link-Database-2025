<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Anyone getting renewal charge tries at the moment for NewsDemon? I haven&#39;t used them in ages, and suddenly they&#39;re trying to charge my prepaid credit card, 3 times in the past hour. It&#39;s not working since I haven&#39;t topped it up. Anyone knows what&#39;s up with this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zwambagger"> /u/zwambagger </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i52ba1/random_newsdemon_renewal_charges/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i52ba1/random_newsdemon_renewal_charges/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been meaning to ask for a while, but one thing that confuses me, is how you can now get 1080p movies for a file size around 2-3GB.</p> <p>I am looking at one now, one file is 12gb and one is 2gb. They both have the exact same resolution, bit rate (3 623 b/s) and framerate (23.0000 fps)...so what&#39;s the difference?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beatfreakman"> /u/beatfreakman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i4v04n/movie_qualityfile_size_what_am_i_missing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i4v04n/movie_qualityfile_size_what_am_i_missing/">[comments]</a></span>
