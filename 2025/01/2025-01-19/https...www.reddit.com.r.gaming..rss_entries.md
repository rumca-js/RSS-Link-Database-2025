## Why aren't Riot Games, Epic Games, etc affected by the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I suppose this is part legal question and part understanding how these companies operate. I&#39;m not from the US so don&#39;t have experience with the nuances, but I do have a lot of experience working in the UK legal sector. Reading through the PAFFACAA, any major application that has over a million users and is more than 20% owned by a foreign adverary and also allows the sharing of text or other content will be banned. This seems to be irrespective of whether the owners/maintainers are based in the US or not. At the moment, 2(g)(3)(A) (sorry I&#39;m not entirely sure how your laws are labelled - please correct me if that&#39;s wrong) specifically defines ByteDance and its subsidiaries but 2(g)(3)(B) implies the definition goes broader.</p> <p>The reason I statted wondering was the banning of Marvel Snap. I know that Marvel Snap is banned because it&#39;s owned by a subsidiary of ByteDance, but I&#39;m confused by the application of the Act here.

I know that Kingdoms of Amalur is often recommended for that, as well as Dragon Age Inquisition, although that misses the crafting.

I knew i was left handed of course, but i just kept with what i knew because it worked. that was, until earlier today i was messing around in Kritta and thought it would be a cool idea to see if it was easier to draw left handed since that&#39;s how i draw on paper.</p> <p>after trying, there was in immediate difference in how easily i could draw simple shapes like circles and squares, so i decided to try it out in over watch just to see and WHY HAVE I BEEN PLAYING RIGHTY MY WHOLE LIFE.</p> <p>immediate noticeable difference in aim, it felt like my mouse was always going where i wanted it to with barely any testing. i tried loading up a game, and all my muscle memory was shot so i couldn&#39;t actually do anything but heal bot as mercy as i struggled to relearn how to play, but overall my camerawork just felt smoother.</p> <p>I&#39;m 

## A simple request to all present and future developers

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tis but a simple request but nonetheless an important one. I hold firmly that this will improve all future games. Perhaps you will not feel the impact for the entire duration of the title; it may not even be noticed. Yet, this means that it was done correctly. I also feel this change will save time, and therefore, funds. Dear developers, can you not make my fucking character touch their fucking eyes while I&#39;m editing their fucking eyes, not grab their jaw when I&#39;m editing their fucking jaw, or move their fucking head while I&#39;m cycling hairs.

## I would kill for a quality multiplayer Hockey game on PC.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s anything that&#39;s high on my list of video game wishes. It would have to be a quality hockey title that is available on PC/Steam.</p> <p>I know hockey isn&#39;t as popular as other sports are. But the game of hockey has a lot to offer. Not only for those of you who don&#39;t watch it in real life, but also to gamers!</p> <p>The more limited appeal combined with the presence of EA Sport&#39;s NHL series, probably makes video game producers think they&#39;d be wasting their time.</p> <p>But I disagree, I think there&#39;s a huge opportunity here. I think EA gives the impression hockey isn&#39;t <em>that</em> popular because the title doesn&#39;t sell as well as say - Fifa or Madden.</p> <p>But I&#39;d argue the reason more people don&#39;t play EA&#39;s NHL. Is because it is EA for one, but <em>also</em> because their NHL game just isn&#39;t that good.</p> <p>I&#39;m a die-hard hockey fan and I haven&#39;t played the series since NHL 1
