<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi ! I’m a SOAR Engineer, I’ve been in the industry for 2 years and have had a lot of exposure to many different SIEM and SOAR tools. I’m currently responsible for managing our SOAR platform, this includes developing new workflows, identifying opportunities, both customer and internal, documenting and working closely with SOC and other teams to help automate their daily workflows along with many other tasks related to SOAR. I’m loving this area of cyber and feel as though I’m quite skilled in the SOAR space - however there’s been a push by my company to get everyone certified. I predominately use a platform called Swimlane and their certs are very limited, I am going for Splunk SOAR Consultant but want to take on more certs in this new year. </p> <p>Does anyone have any recommendations ? I’ve thought about going for the blue team certs, trying to put myself in the shoes of a SOC analyst so I can identify more areas for automation as well as try and f

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey! I&#39;m trying to get a start in Cybersecurity—specifically more on the Defensive/Analytical side of things—but I have no idea where to really go from here. I&#39;ve always wanted to do stuff like this (ever since I was little!) but I really only know how to program, and this stuff has to do with the things WAY underneath all that. I know that I need to understand everything about hardware, software, and networking, but I have no idea where to start. For extra context, I&#39;m currently in college for Cybersecurity, but those classes don&#39;t start until my second Sophmore term, and I&#39;m trying to at least get some kind of knowledge under my belt before then. I do really well with following lists in chronological order, but anything works :]! </p> <p>Many thanks! I hope to come back to this place in the future and actually understand what&#39;s going on, haha.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

## Why is cooperation between countries restricted in the case of extradition under the Cybercrime Convention 2004?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to understand the reasoning behind the restriction on cooperation in cases of extradition under the Cybercrime Convention. The convention states that cooperation may be restricted in cases involving extradition, but I&#39;m not sure why this would be the case. I don&#39;t have a deep legal background, so could someone explain why extradition cases might have limitations when it comes to mutual assistance in cybercrime investigations?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is not a political post.</p> <p>Is anyone else astonished at how poorly the government has explained the TikTok ban to the nation?</p> <p>I’m bringing this up here because the reasons behind it seem so tied into Cybersecurity.</p> <p>I’ve been in the industry for a long time and recently realized that the generation most upset about this wasn’t old enough / paying attention when the Mandiant APT 1 report was released and missed all of the coverage about China as a vast conductor of strategically directed hacking of the US public and private sectors. They don’t remember when TikTok first came out and any pretty much everyone who reversed / looked at what the app was actually doing under the hood concluded “this is spyware”.</p> <p>It just seems so blatantly obvious that it’s really against our national interest to have such an incredibly potent data collection and influence tool in the hands of a nation with interests that conflict with ours.</p>
