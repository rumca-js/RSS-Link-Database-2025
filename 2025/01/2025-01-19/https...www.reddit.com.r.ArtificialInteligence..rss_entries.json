I&#39;m enrolled in computer science, so we have quite leverage on choosing any specific domain. Throughout my studies I&#39;ve mostly found interest in AI, so that&#39;s what I have decided to choose for my fyp. Now I&#39;ve explored a range of topics for the project, but most of them are things that have already been done countless times. I&#39;m looking for some unique ideas, mainly something product-based. I&#39;ve set aside a few ideas, but really want to get in more ideas before choosing something. Like what could bea good product-based idea I could work on? Something unique, something rewarding something like that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/falselifee\"> /u/falselifee </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i4ms5a/needed_some_ideas_for_a_final_year_project/\">[link]</a></span> &",

My team deploys many internal web and integration apps to the cloud, maintains security-focused modules in ServiceNow, participates in developing security policies/standards, assists in SIEM work, and automating workflows for the other cybersecurity/GRC teams. Recently we undertook a project to fine-tune open-source NER models to detect secrets (e.g. passwords, API keys) in our organization&#39;s code repositories. This has given some good hands-on experience with Huggingface, TensorFlow, and PyTorch and a novice understanding of their underlying algorithms. </p> <p>The new job opportunity:</p> <p>My employer is looking to fill an Associate AI/ML Engineer. They removed the listing recently, so I no longer have the responsibilities description. But, I can say it sounded more like configuring and maintaining AI platforms/services, fol",
