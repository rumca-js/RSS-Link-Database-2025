Voodoo is a deeply rooted spiritual tradition in Benin, recognized as an official religion. Originating in West Africa, it involves the worship of spirits and ancestors, rituals, drumming, and trance ceremonies. Voodoo plays a central role in West African culture, influencing art, music, and daily life.

In this adventure we travel through the underbelly of Benin, searching for a real Voodoo ritual... and I think we definitely found it.
