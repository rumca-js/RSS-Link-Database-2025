Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at an interesting complaint filed by the FTC, with a pretty eye-opening fine as well. Genshin Impact is one of the most popular gacha games out there and it's drawn enough attention for the government to look at how younger audiences and loot boxes intersect.
