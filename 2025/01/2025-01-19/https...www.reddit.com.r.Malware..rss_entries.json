Every time I block said emails, they send in 5 more accounts to email me. I have been receiving less and less recently but this one particularly stuck out to me because of the repeated mention of &quot;FreshDesk&quot; and the use of a Jekyll and Hyde quote. Can somebody please tell me what these are? I stupidly opened one of the files a few years back, and it was a PDF. It didn&#39;t even give me a virus. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PabloplaysRestart\"> /u/PabloplaysRestart </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/g4ix6yjt7yde1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1i4xw8s/mysterious_emails_ive_been_receiving_for_the/\">[comments]</a>",
