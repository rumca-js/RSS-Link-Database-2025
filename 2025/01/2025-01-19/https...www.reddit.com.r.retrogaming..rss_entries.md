But I want to have more options in terms of buttons and have a joystick as well so you can play other third party games. I&#39;m doing some basic designs for the shell and wanted to know what was the most comfortable or natural position you would want to have for your hands in a resting or neutral position that would be the most intuitive for you? Especially when it comes to left vs right handed people. </p> <p>Do you prefer to have the D-pad on the left and the joystick on the right with A,B buttons on the right? Or have it inversed and have everything on the opposite side? Do you like multiple joysticks like a steam deck or just have one? Sorry if this sounds like a marketing post.
