And it&#39;s a shame, because I would&#39;ve loved to understand everything in this first watch and consider It a masterpiece like a lot of people do. Hell, I still want to. Is it a masterpiece and I just couldn&#39;t grasp its greatness because of its non-conventional, messy and abstract narrative? Maybe.

I&#39;ve since gone through Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Fly (1986), They Live (1988), The Dead Zone (1983), and Prince of Darkness (1987).</p> <p>There&#39;s a vibe in these films that I&#39;m after. I didn&#39;t plan it out, just went to what felt best next, each film gave me a vibe that led to the next one. Invasion made me want to watch The Fly, which reminded me of They Live, etc. It&#39;s interesting that Cronenberg made me want to watch Carpenter next, and Carpenter made me want to watch Cronenberg next.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure all of this will lead into finishing Carpenter&#39;s Apocalypse Trilogy followed up with Event Horizon which will probably lead to Dark City, but I want some more of the 70&#39;s/80&#39;s flavour the others have first.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",

It just shows a bunch of clips from the previous movie, often with little rhyme or reason, not really explaining plot points in any detail, just scenes of Superman flying around and saving people. Aside from once again showing the scene of Zod and his henchmen being sent to the Phantom Zone, I don&#39;t think that recap was necessary, the movie itself at the start quickly establishes everything you know about Superman and his cast, Otis in prison even gives blatant exposition dialogue of the crimes Luthor committed last movie (something the recap didn&#39;t even make that clear). </p> <p>One could also argue that the recap is for the benefit of people who didn&#39;t see the first movie and Superman II is the first Superman movie they&#39;ve ever seen (which in the days before widespread home video",

Something that makes you pause and immediately Shazam it.</p> <p>Any genre of movie works, as long as the music is memorable and different. Would love your suggestions for movies that deliver on both fronts: a great story and killer music!</p> <p>Hit me up with your recommendations \u2014 I\u2019m ready to dive into some groovy vibes.
