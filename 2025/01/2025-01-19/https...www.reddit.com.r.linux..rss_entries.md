<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for a solution to connecting remotely to my Fedora KDE machine for a while now. I&#39;ve tried VNC and it was slow and laggy and tried KRDP but it doesn&#39;t work.</p> <p>What do you folks use to remotely connect and view your desktop? Is this just not a Linux thing?</p> <p>I&#39;m at a bit of a loss why KVMs like the piKVM are so popular, as why not just ssh to the headless server without a DE, yet graphically connecting to a DE seems like a foreign concept to most users.</p> <p>Even when using VNC or KRDP when I can magically get them to work, they literally will just unlock the remote machine and just mirror commands, not the best solution.</p> <p>Ideally simply opening a virtual desktop and streaming it out would be best, like what RDP does in Windows. Without unlocking the remote machine.</p> <p>Anyhow am I the only person who remotely connects to a DE? Or what am I doing wrong?</p> <p>Thanks for any help.</p> </div><!-- S

## Why Linux foundation funded Chromium but not Firefox?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In my opinion Chromium is a lost cause for people who wants free internet. The main branch got rid of Manifest V2 just to get rid of ad-blockers like u-Block. You&#39;re redirected to Chrome web-store and to login a Google account. Maybe some underrated fork still supports it but idc.</p> <p>Even if it&#39;s open-source, Google is pushing their proprietary garbage. Chrome for a long time didn&#39;t care about giving multi architecture support. Firefox officially support ARM64 Linux but Chrome only supports x64. You&#39;ve to rely on unofficial chrome or chromium builds for ARM support.</p> <p>The decision to support Chromium based browsers is suspicious because the timing matches with the anti-trust case.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ActiveCommittee8202"> /u/ActiveCommittee8202 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i589ug/why_linux_foundation_funded_chromium_but_no

## Is sudo really a good idea?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sudo has always seemed a little iffy to me. Instead of logging into a sysadmin account to do something privileged, you can just type this magic word and boom, you&#39;re god. It&#39;s very convenient, and a good safety feature if you only use it when you need to. Now and then the OS refuses to do a system-damaging thing I didn&#39;t mean to do - but it would have gone ahead if I had typed sudo. </p> <p>I just kind of casually wonder if it&#39;s going to become a problem as more and more people who really don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing are encouraged to adopt Linux. &quot;I just typed what the guy on reddit said.&quot; Did you know what you were typing? &quot;Well, not really...&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LovableSidekick"> /u/LovableSidekick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i57z66/is_sudo_really_a_good_idea/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href

When I was using Microsoft I realize how hard they pushed for users to get apps in the Microsoft store. This makes sense as it’s their own store and can make more money that way but, I never find myself opening it or using it. </p> <p>Now that I moved to Mint, I have been surprised by how much I’ve use software manager. Feels like the Microsoft store but more straight to the point. Something about it just makes it feel easier and better to use. Only downsides is I wish there were more reviews of the apps. </p> <p>This was just a random thought. Maybe you guys know the real meaning of why I feel this way or maybe you guys have also felt this way.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I thought I&#39;d try Mint as people have been saying positive things. Problems have occurred since formatting and switching. Tried to install appmanager and it wouldn&#39;t install as it needed a dependent that the system won&#39;t upgrade as it&#39;s already past it or something....crap. </p> <p>Then I tried using something on USB and it kept saying it&#39;s locked with another process, but it reads data on it fine. But use a program and it doesn&#39;t (this is Flipper Zero). </p> <p>Couldn&#39;t get my 3Dprinter slicers to load properly, kept having to scrub the system and reload the slicers. Nope.</p> <p>So now I&#39;m pulling my /home drive and going home. I&#39;ll be installing Ubuntu again as it&#39;s quirks I can work around. ...maybe. Or else I&#39;ll be trying something else.
