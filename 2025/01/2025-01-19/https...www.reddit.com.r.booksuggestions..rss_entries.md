She had the idea that we could start a book club together. Love the idea now only need suggestions because I don&#39;t know. I love old classics (austen, bronte sisters, dickens, stoker, etc), newer classics (hemingway, how to kill a mockingbird, like the writing style of gabriel garcia marquez). I really liked the hunger games, twilight when I was young. Liked the acotar series and love a house of salt and sorrows. </p> <p>Since she is 12 I have to buy the books for us both. So I would like to know some older books that are cheaper. I can&#39;t really afford to buy books that are €25+ each every month. She really wants to read at the same time and I love that idea but financially it&#39;s not happening with the new releases she would like to read.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good evening all. First time posting anything on Reddit, but in dire need of a recommendation. I just finished the Earth’s Children series (Jean M. Auel; Clan of the Cave Bear, etc.), which I found very comforting and hard to break loose from, but now that it’s over I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. I’m fascinated by Paleolithic/early human material, but the online consensus seems to be that the Earth’s Children series is the only successfully serious attempt at this niche sub-genre of historical fiction. And out of reverence to that series, I don’t really want to chance any others that may purport to be similar.</p> <p>I need an entirely new adventure to set out on in a completely different direction.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations - preferably very long, and perhaps in a series - I’m quite open to anything.</p> <p>Thank you all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Publius654

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi readers, I&#39;m a literature student from Mexico and I&#39;m very interested in experimental books that play with shapes, sizes, fonts or graphics. I already know House of Leaves and other well known experimental classics. I&#39;m looking for more niche, yet to be translated books. Do you have any recommendations? Any genre is okay, but I prefer books that aren&#39;t novels. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xAfterlight"> /u/xAfterlight </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i4m9zo/experimental_books_with_graphic_aspects/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i4m9zo/experimental_books_with_graphic_aspects/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for something with a rest stop setting. I absolutely loved No Exit by Taylor Adams for this. Something about being trapped in a dingy rest stop with a bunch of strangers feels like the perfect set up for a thriller. I also really enjoyed close quarter roadtrip set up in Survive the Night by Riley Sager. I am fiending for something with a similar vibe/setting and would love any and all recs :&gt;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/l0stgxrl"> /u/l0stgxrl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i4m4ok/rest_stop_horror_mystery_or_thriller_rec_similar/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i4m4ok/rest_stop_horror_mystery_or_thriller_rec_similar/">[comments]</a></span>

## Should I read the sequels to Things Fall Apart in release or chronological order?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen places that reading No Longer at Ease and Arrow of God in release order works better thematically, but what order would be closer to how the author intended or what order would work best for reading?
