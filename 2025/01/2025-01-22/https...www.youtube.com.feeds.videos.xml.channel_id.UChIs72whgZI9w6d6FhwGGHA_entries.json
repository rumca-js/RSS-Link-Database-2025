        "description": "Sponsor: Arctic Liquid Freezer III on Amazon - https://geni.us/NrMtDT\nThe Phanteks Eclipse G400A case is supposed to be around $100 to $110 and targets the high airflow PC case market, replacing the older P400A (and especially the P400A Digital, which we liked in its era). The G400A case is a potential alternative to the Lian Li Lancool 207 case, with a big push lately for driving more air into the GPU area of the case. These benchmarks compare the G400A to some of the best PC cases on the market in 2025.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
