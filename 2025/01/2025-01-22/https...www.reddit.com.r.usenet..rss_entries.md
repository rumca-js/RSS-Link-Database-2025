<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had newshosting for years and very very rarely ever had anything that I grabbed from my indexers have missing blocks and fail to repair. However, lately (past few weeks or so) I&#39;m getting a much higher frequency of missing blocks and files that fail to repair with newshosting. Anyone else having this issue as well? It&#39;s definitely not an issue with the indexers since I&#39;m grabbing them from the best indexers. Anyone have a recommendation for a reliable backup provider? I switched from cheaper providers to newshosting because of incomplete issues many years ago, but if there is a more reliable provider nowadays, I don&#39;t mind switching.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deanze1"> /u/deanze1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i7nanu/issues_with_missing_blocks_on_newshosting_lately/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a usenet user, mostly for TV via NZBGeek. I am an ages ago torrenter on What.cd etc, but have not torrented in a long time. There are just some records that I can not find on streaming or elsewhere and I want to to be able to find them. I am happy to seed, though I acknowledge some trackers likely have prerequisites that I don&#39;t fulfill.</p> <p>What options are even available to me to join realistically? Most folks on here say torrents are the way for music, but, like, which modern trackers are popular and strong and can I actually join?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/makesupwordsblomp"> /u/makesupwordsblomp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i7bvuc/closest_depthbreadth_to_whatcd_waffles_etc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i7bvuc/closest_depthbreadth_to_whatcd_waffles_etc/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, quick question… Didn’t get any pre-renewal notice, and then got charged £72.56 (€86.47) by Eweka about two weeks ago. Does anyone know if that’s their standard price? Can I cancel it and get refund pro rata? Considering switching to another provider if that’s how much they charge an existing user. Have anyone reached out to them to adjust the annual fee?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/karubin"> /u/karubin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i780el/renewal_rate_of_eweka/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i780el/renewal_rate_of_eweka/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there. I&#39;m hoping to find a provider and/or indexer that is well known for books and/or audiobooks. I&#39;m hoping to integrate those with either LazyLibrarian or the arrs.</p> <p>I know there is Libgen and Anna&#39;s-Archive, but I&#39;ve found them difficult to integrate with the aforementioned.</p> <p>Any suggestions are appreciated! Thank-you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TravelinAroundOnPts"> /u/TravelinAroundOnPts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i77v8m/best_indexerprovider_for_books_and_audiobooks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i77v8m/best_indexerprovider_for_books_and_audiobooks/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Newsgrouper, my web gateway to Usenet, now has an option to search old posts downloaded from the Internet Archive. These run from the &quot;Great Renaming&quot; in 1987 up to 2013. The period after that is covered by the facility I already had to search BlueWorldHosting, which covers from 2003 to the present.</p> <p>I now have archive files for the whole of the &quot;big 8&quot; hierarchies: comp humanities misc news rec sci soc talk. For groups where the archive search option is available you can find it by selecting a group and then clicking &quot;Find Articles&quot;.
