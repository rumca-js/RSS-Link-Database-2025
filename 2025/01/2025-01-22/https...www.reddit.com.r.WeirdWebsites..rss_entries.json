It was a website that listed all things strange, or all strange or paranormal objects (for example it listed that soda machine in Seattle that is supposedly mysterious for some reason. It lists it and gives a brief description of what it is and assigns it a number. It was a huge site, just a big list really. Does anyone know what site it is? Any help would be appreciated thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Joe4H\"> /u/Joe4H </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWebsites/comments/1i7fkpk/question_about_a_website_i_cant_remember/\">[comments]</a></span>",
