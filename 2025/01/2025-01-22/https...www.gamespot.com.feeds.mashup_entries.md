For most people, it's an experience that is familiar thanks to the Switch, but these days it's not a feature exclusive to Nintendo's devices. Everything from beefy hardware like the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-extreme-gets-200-discount-comes-with-free-travel-case/1100-6524126/">Asus ROG Ally</a> to comparatively modestly powered emulation handhelds like Anbernic's various devices are capable of being plugged into a large screen for a more traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Docks, then, are almost essential these days.

One of the main reasons for the cancelation revolved around disagreements over the Celeste IP rights, the details of which the studio has decided not to disclose.

<p>It's hard to believe it's been 25 years since Star Wars: The Phantom Menace first hit theaters. If that li'l reminder has you feeling nostalgic (and old), you'll be happy to know that four games based off the 1999 film are coming to PC and select consoles in a new bundle.</p><p>The Star Wars: Prequel Pack features four action-packed Star Wars games. The pack includes Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles, Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, Star Wars Republic Commando, and Star Wars Episode I: Racer. The bundle will be available to purchase tomorrow, February 23, on PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable of these four games is Star Wars Episode I: Racer, which was released on Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color back in 1999. The sci-fi racing game allows players to play as Anakin or any one of the game's 22 Podracers, and travel at speeds of up to 600 mph as they traverse tracks set across eight iconic Star Wars worlds.</p><a

<p>Captain Blood, a pirate-themed action-adventure game that was supposed to launch in 2010 but has been stuck in development hell since then, will finally come out on May 6.</p><p>Captain Blood is an Xbox 360-era action-adventure game through and through, following a pirate captain on a quest to save a damsel in distress after other, more evil, pirates kidnap her. To accomplish that, the titular antihero needs to punch, slash, and shoot his way through anyone who gets in their way, completing the occasional quick-time event or fighting powerful enemy bosses. It looks like a throwback to action games on consoles like PS2 and Xbox 360, which makes sense as that's the era of gaming Captain Blood is actually from.</p><div data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9RGxq68w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen
