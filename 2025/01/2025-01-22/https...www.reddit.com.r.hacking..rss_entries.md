<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I got a Motion Sensor which is PIR and Microwave but it seems like it&#39;s on an AND gate (both PIR and microwave have to detect to alarm) since PIR can be easily defeated by an umbrella or other covering technique.

This number has also called me a few times; I didnâ€™t answer and it hasnâ€™t left a voicemail. Yet, my name is stated in on my voicemail recording so it definitely seems nefarious that theyâ€™re denying that they have the wrong number and asking what my name is. </p> <p>Iâ€™ve tried reverse number searches and essentially get no results for the number. Itâ€™s a 571 area code. Also no results on google searching. I used a google voice number of my own to call the number; the person answered but just mumbled â€œhmm
