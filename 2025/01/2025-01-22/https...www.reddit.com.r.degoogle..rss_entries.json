This would be the first time I&#39;ve paid for an email service, but 5-ish bucks a month is still very affordable for me. It also doesn&#39;t require a separate domain. My only fear is that other websites won&#39;t recognise it and bounce my mail back, or not allow me to sign up for their services. I&#39;ve read that happens sometimes with Proton, which is one reason I&#39;ve decided not to go with them.
