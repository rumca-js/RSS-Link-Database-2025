## 3 Python web frameworks for beautiful front ends

<p>Python has long had a presence as a language for server-side frameworks, with support for most every project size or use case. But it’s historically been confined to the back end—there’s no real culture of writing Python for creating front-end, client-side code. At least not yet.</p>



<p>Recently, some projects have tried to <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2335480/intro-to-pyscript-run-python-in-your-web-browser.html">transpile Python to JavaScript on the front end</a>, or run Python on the front end via <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2337567/11-fun-ways-to-get-started-with-webassembly.html">WebAssembly</a>. There’s promise in the idea, but the way it’s currently implem

<p>Last week I talked about <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3801853/where-big-piles-of-mud-come-from.html">where those big, unwieldy code bases come from</a>. They don’t appear out of nowhere, and no one ever plans to create one. Defining a problem is great, but what is one to do? How will you deal with the Big Pile of Mud that you inherited?</p>



<p>It’s tempting — and I see this temptation indulged all the time — to stamp your feet and bitch and moan about the big mess you have. I am sorry to say that I’ve been a staunch complainer in these situations in the past. How could anyone have been so foolish? No developer could actually be this bad, right? What were they thinking?</p>

<p>Getting a complete picture of the multi-headed beast that is the JavaScript ecosystem isn’t easy, but the annual <a href="https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US">State of JavaScript</a> survey is a good place to start. What makes this survey stand out is that it attracts the input of thousands of working developers and other JavaScript enthusiasts. Reading it gives you a real sense of the movements that are defining the language and its ecosystem.</p>



<p>Here I’ve collected my key takeaways from the recently released 2024 State of JavaScript survey, starting with a look at one of the most important trends currently rocking the world of software development. We’ll also look at ongoing pain points,

<p>In explaining the motivation behind the proposal, created January 2, the authors state that Python packages are particularly affected by a <a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/dependency-resolution-in-python-beware-the-phantom-dependency">phantom dependency</a> pro
