An idea that often provokes existential thoughts in my adult life. </p> <p>The pure magic and emotion of the film has stuck with me and cemented it&#39;s place as my favourite Spielberg film.

Maybe it&#39;s not &quot;important&quot; in the way other movies are, but it has great pacing, tension, action.</p> <p>Denis Villeneuve is obviously an all time great director and does a fantastic job. The performances from Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are complex and believable. Whether or not you are a boomer who enjoys the Yellowstone Extended Universe, Taylor Sheridan is a talented writer and it&#39;s a great script.</p> <p>Then on top of that Jóhann Jóhannsson (RIP) delivers one of his best scores. Amazing cinematography from Roger Deakins who may be the greatest cinematographer of all time. Even Joe Walker&#39;s editing is noticeably good.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure people in the comments will trot out all the classics and say various movies are more innovative, or influential, or important and yes that&#39;s true.
