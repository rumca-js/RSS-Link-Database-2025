Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\u200b\n\nComing after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump\u2019s felony conviction in a \u201chush money\u201d case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden\u2019s exit from the race just four months before the election, \u201cTrump\u2019s Comeback\u201d tells the story of Trump\u2019s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.\n\nThe film investigates how Trump\u2019s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.\n\nThe documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE\u2019s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump\u2019s 2024 election victory.\n",
