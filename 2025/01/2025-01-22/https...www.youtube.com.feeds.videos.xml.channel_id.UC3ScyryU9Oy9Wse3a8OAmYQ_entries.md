Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.
