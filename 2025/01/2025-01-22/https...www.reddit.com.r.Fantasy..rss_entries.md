<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obligatory complaint about the Hugos just to get that out of the way.</p> <p>I&#39;ve decided I want to be the change I want to see in the world and submit a ballot this year. Since I want to give myself time to read a bunch of 2024 releases first, I&#39;m curious about what people have enjoyed and think will be nominated vs should be nominated. </p> <p>I will definitely be nominating Metal From Heaven, which I loved. Looking forward to reading The Tainted Cup and The Dead Cat Tail Assassins. I also loved The Fireborne Blade by Charlotte Bond, but I need to double check the cutoff date to make sure it&#39;s not in the middle of the year.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Most_Concept"> /u/Most_Concept </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i7pgs8/early_hugo_guessesnominations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i7pgs8/ear

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The book year 2025 started for me with the <strong>Nightrunner</strong> series - all 7+1 books one after the other. You will always encounter Nightrunner in comments of posts where the OP requests queer fantasy - and there&#39;s a reason for that as I found out, <em>it&#39;s really good</em>, perhaps the best traditional fantasy series with an M/M relationship between the main characters!</p> <p>The first 2 books (<em>Luck in the Shadows</em> and <em>Stalking Darkness</em>) are an overarching plot, as are the 4th and 5th (<em>Shadows Return</em> and <em>The White Road</em>). Books 3, 6 and 7 have relatively autonomous plots. As Flewelling had said, this isn&#39;t an epic fantasy series building up until the last book, but the adventures of Alec and Seregil which can be less or more connected to their previous ones.</p> <p><strong><em>Stand-outs:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>The relationship between Alec and Seregil: it slowly builds and passes various

It could be from a book, movie, video game based – anything fantasy. And why would you choose that world?</p> <p>I would choose to be born as an heir in a noble house in GRRM’s Westeros. A middle-tier one would be great. I would have loved to be fostered at larger lord’s house to be trained by the greats with other peers whom I could network with. Then I could come of age and help influence the growth of my house into more glory in a world full of political intrigue, medieval warriors, and a hint of magic. Each decision, each conversation being meaningful in designing the furthering of the family’s goals. That’s what comes to mind for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AidenMarquis"> /u/AidenMarquis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://ww

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello <a href="/r/Fantasy">r/Fantasy</a>! I know this series is not particularly popular here, but as someone who really enjoyed <em>Fourth Wing</em> despite it being outside what I typically read (Abercrombie, Sanderson, Dinniman, Hobb, Fonda Lee, Ken Liu, Ruocchio, Brennan, Kingfisher, etc.) I need to get some negative thoughts out about this new release. Again, I really enjoyed <em>Fourth Wing</em>, so if you didn&#39;t, either this review is not for you or you might enjoy watching me rant about this book LOL</p> <p><em>Fourth Wing</em> was a book that really worked for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I acknowledge the flaws: the worldbuilding made little sense, the writing was mediocre at its best and cringey at its worst, and most of all Violet&#39;s horny thoughts were the literal worst thing I&#39;ve ever read. HOWEVER, all the same, I found the character banter charming, the protagonist&#39;s relationships to her family members really compelling,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What is a series that you both love and hate? A series where the high points are just amazing for you, but there are low points (bad plot-line, character arc, writing choice) that really bring it down.</p> <p>For me, two series fit that description:</p> <p>1) Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn - some of the best world-building and battles I’ve ever read. (And the stuff with the elves is my favorite elf stuff I’ve ever read) BUT, some sections are a horrible slog, some characters horribly annoying/boring, and an ending that really felt like it didn’t live up to the buildup.</p> <p>2) Realm of the Elderlings - Immaculate prose, amazing companion in Nighteyes, and some stellar character work. BUT, several books are kind of meh, lots of pacing issues, some frustrating plot-lines, and many plot-lines that seem to exist only for the sake of misery-porn.</p> <p>Of course this is all subjective. I would love to hear what series, for you, is so close to being perfect/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dan Simmons is one of my favourite authors of all time. He’s incredibly consistent in quality and can successfully write across so many genres and styles.</p> <p>I’ve never really been the biggest fan of horror, at least not in novel form. For that reason, Stephen King hasn’t clicked with me yet. I’d love to find something of his that works for me, but reading <em>The Shining</em> and <em>The Dead Zone</em> didn’t quite do it.</p> <p>I discovered Dan Simmons through the <em>Hyperion Cantos</em>. Science fiction is my genre—it speaks to me—so it’s no surprise that <em>Hyperion</em> left an incredible first impression. I followed it up with <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> but haven’t yet continued the series with <em>Endymion</em> or <em>The Rise of Endymion</em>. This isn’t because of a lack of interest; I just haven’t gotten to them yet. Then I read <em>Ilium</em>, which blew my mind. I loved it, though, like with <em>Endymion</em>, I haven’t read its

I love a slow plot. That tells me it might be very character driven or maybe it&#39;s political and it&#39;s all conversations instead of action scenes.
