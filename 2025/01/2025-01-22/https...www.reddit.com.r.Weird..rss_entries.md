I did take antibiotics for my surgery and it could be an allergic reaction to that, but Ive taken the same ones before and nothing happened.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This poster on a tree in my neighborhood. The text says: This man has a mental illness and is a carrier of AIDS. People who see him should stay away from him to avoid contagion. </p> <p>Clearly someone cut out and pasted the man&#39;s picture over that image but what strikes me most is the message. I feel that it is written in a strange way (I don&#39;t feel that it was done by someone who knows Spanish) and I feel that it is more someone of Asian origin wanting to defame another person. I have seen that in China this kind of defamation can even end someone&#39;s life or career.</p> <p>As a context, lately many Chinese immigrants (wholesale traders) have arrived to Mexico to live in my neighborhood and its surroundings, I feel that this is something between them to create a bad reputation among the same community.
