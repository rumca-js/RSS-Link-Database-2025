They only exist in dutch.The summaries of both books seem pretty similar, an overview of forensic psychiatry. Not my primary field of interest, but I feel like I have to know the basics of it in my future job anyway. The first is written by a forensic psychiatrist and a lawyer. (Rating on Goodreads: 3,5/5). With reviews saying that some parts are badly written, but overall a good introduction to forensic psychiatry. The second is written by a well known forensic psychiatrist. (Rating: 3/5) With reviews saying it&#39;s hastily and superficially written. </p> <p>The third book is on forensic anthropology (The Bone Woman by Clea Koff). It was recommended to me in an earlier post. It&#39;s about digging in war zones. Again, not my primary field of interest, but my professor

I would have liked it more if Richard Matheson didn&#39;t shy away from describing the disturbing sequences. There were parts were he describes the MC going house to house, murdering vampires with wooden stakes but all mentions of violence is intentionally avoided. There are attempts at making it disturbing like when he describes how the MC drags the vampires through houses and over steps, banging their heads on stuff and watching them burn in the sunlight. Even me just typing that sentence felt more menacing and violent than the book felt though. 😬</p> <p>Its readability felt very off to me, which is one of the most important qualities in a book. I couldn&#39;t go more than a few sentences before getting lost and having to backtrack. 😵‍💫 Granted, this might be due to my brain not being normal, but it was very frus

Also more mature themes, not just &quot;this guy bad and we good&quot; and

Out of no where his male friend asked him “so which one have you masterbated to” and I’m taken aback because WTF?!? Do women think men think like this???

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I suppose any recommendation would do as I am trying to branch out a bit in what I read. Though bonus points if it’s something that might be more appealing for a straight cis male audience. I’ve been told romance novels usually have women as the target demographic. I tried ACOTAR. Not as some representative of the entire romance genre but more as an intro. Something that seemed easy enough and popular enough (at least I’ve seen it talked about any time I tried searching romantasy) that I could talk about it with many. I did feel kinda out of place reading it in some scenes.

She’s this light in his world, and somehow, she starts to bring him back to life in ways he didn’t even know were possible.</p> <p>But here’s the twist: the more he lets himself care about her, the more his inner darkness starts to take over. He’s scared of becoming the monster he’s always feared he could be, especially because he can feel how dangerous he is to her.</p> <p>It’s this beautiful, intense push-and-pull between love and fear, light and shadow. The more time they spend together, the more you’re left wondering: C
