<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hoping someone more experienced with this could help me figure this out. So I have proxmox set up and just installed plex in an lxc using a helper script. I want to connect my external hdd that is ntfs and contains my current media collection. I believe the drive also needs to be accessible to the arr suite lxc&#39;s as well and needs to remain accessible even after any of the containers or the whole server restarts. Can anyone point me in the direction of any guides on how to achieve this?

And obviously, it so less expensive to build our own server.</p> <p>Our criterias are the following : - Most of the time only 2 player (him and me), but sometimes 2 more players. - Server that could play 2-3 games max at same time (because we have solo games for chilling, or other is not available, or one of us don’t like a game,…) -

So using the facial recognition in the photos app, I created an album of all of our kids videos on our phones. I then used the “PhotoSync” app to send those albums via SMB to a folder on my server. That folder is linked to a “other videos” Plex library. If you go to the folders view in that library on plex, you can choose to shuffle the whole folder of videos. So now we can sit and watch our kids videos whenever we want. We love it and our kids love it! We probably have hours of footage but all of the videos are typically 15 to 45 seconds. </p> <p>One caveat is that I’ve noticed that Plex on some devices (like my Nvidia Shield Pro) will play all of the videos in landscape mode even if they were filmed in portrait
