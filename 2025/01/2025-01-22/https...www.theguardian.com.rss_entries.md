<p>Job done for Mikel Arteta. After the week he’s had, the last thing the Arsenal manager would have wanted was another frantic finale to a home fixture. For much of this contest, after Declan Rice had fired the hosts in front after only 72 seconds, it seemed Arsenal may have to go the distance as they huffed and puffed but couldn’t find a second goal to see off a spirited Dinamo Zagreb side managed by defensive master Fabio Cannavaro.</p><p>A collective sigh of relief greeted the second goal from Kai Havertz when it eventually came 20 minutes before the end as Martin Ødegaard added a third late on to virtually assure Arsenal will finish in the top eight and avoid the need for a playoff next month. With a warm weather training camp in Dubai lined up instead after their early exit from the FA Cup, it could do Arteta’s weary squad the world of good in the long run.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/22/arsenal-dinamo-zagreb-champions-league-match-report">Continu

<p><strong>Opera House, Manchester</strong><br>A meandering musical based on the Doris Day movie delivers the sure-shot showtunes in style with a whipcracking lead in Carrie Hope Fletcher</p><p>The 1953 film Calamity Jane is quick on the draw. Doris Day’s romcom western gets under way with lickety-split rhythm and irresistible whip-crack-away refrains. This stage adaptation takes its sweet time to get going, with a bit of tomfoolery from a grizzled, banjo-twanging barfly and the denizens of Deadwood opening with a ballad, The Black Hills of Dakota.</p><p>That is indicative of a show that ambles through the same storyline, adding half an hour (including a handful of extra songs) to its running time. Some of the material passes by like tumbleweed but the song Men! features Calamity ribbing the opposite sex, redressing the barrage of feminine ideals she faces in the film. Another catchy addition, Careless With the Truth, reinforces the frontierswoman’s taste for self-mythologising.</p><
