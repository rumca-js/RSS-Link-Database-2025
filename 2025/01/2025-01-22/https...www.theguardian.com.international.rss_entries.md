<p><strong>Theatre Royal Bath<br></strong>While this 1960 play has been overtaken by faster-moving tales of Tudor chicanery, Martin Shaw is compelling as Thomas More</p><p>Among the abounding villains and backstabbers of the Tudor age stands Thomas More, a good man who dared to take a silent stand against King Henry VIII. But Robert Bolt’s play shows that being good could be just as dangerous for one’s head.</p><p>This 1960 drama, which takes us through More’s last years, was immensely successful in its time, transferring to Broadway and adapted for film with Paul Scofield. Jonathan Church’s new touring production is smart and handsome but feels like an old-fashioned history play, creaky in parts though still an ultimately moving portrait of quiet heroism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/22/a-man-for-all-seasons-review-creaky-but-moving-portrait-of-quiet-heroism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>“We will play and then we will see,” Carlo Ancelotti had said, so Real Madrid did their part and by the end of an ultimately easy night, life looked good again. The European champions started this match as the 22nd best team in the continent, somewhere towards the bottom of a table that keeps everyone guessing and supposedly on the edge of a catastrophe, and finished it six places higher and feeling as if they are among the favourites again. If, the coach was keen to stress, they can defend better.</p><p>Madrid had been defeated by Lille, Milan and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/27/liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report">Liverpool</a>, but there was time still and a revival to come and now a 5-1 victory over Red Bull Salzburg in their penultimate game has lifted them back among the seeds for the playoff round.

<p>It ought to have been over. In previous times, it surely would have been. Erling Haaland had tapped in from close range, shortly after the substitute, Jack Grealish, had broken the deadlock.

But the interpreter is more interested in songs than stardom</p><p>Sam Amidon grew up in the 1980s, but his Vermont childhood was “almost like a refuge” from the gaudiest decade. His hippy parents were folk-singer educators who frequently travelled south to work with Sacred Harp shape-note singers. “We were still eating granola and tofu stir fry, growing veggies and having potlucks,” he says. “Nobody had a television. I remember seeing a picture of Michael Jackson on somebody’s notebook, but I had no idea what he sounded like.” The family had one Talking Heads cassette, one Cyndi Lauper cassette and one Bob Dylan cassette, albeit of traditional songs. “The idea of the singer-songwriter model just wasn’t in my life.”</p><p>Amidon followed his parents into music, becoming a fiddle prodigy and noted folk singer, releasing acclaimed albums for Nonesuch, and collaborating with jazz guitaris

Takashi Shimura is veteran police officer Detective Sato, tolerant, good-humoured, realistic about the prospects for containing, if not eradicating crime, and Toshiro Mifune is his partner, rookie cop Murakami, pa

<p>With concern being voiced over TV ratings, we asked insiders what they would change to make the NBA more attractive to viewers</p><p>When four-time champion Robert Parish played in the NBA, there was no such thing as load management. While the idea, which was born in San Antonio as the Spurs managed the twilight years of stars like Tim Duncan, has since become widespread, Parish, who played the most regular season games in NBA history, says he doesn’t like it. Indeed, ridding the NBA of load management is one of the many tweaks a chorus of fans and former players have been suggesting lately. As conversations continue about <a href="https://fadeawayworld.net/nba-media/adam-silver-believes-nba-ratings-down-young-people-dont-watch-traditional-cable">why early season ratings have been down</a>, fixes galore have been suggested.

But now oligarchs like Musk put themselves at the center of political campaigns and aspire to govern.

<p>A judging spectre watches as depression and heavy drinking befall Lucy Liu’s home in an intelligent film full of uncanny, sudden-chill moments</p><p>Steven Soderbergh has made a ghost story with a screenplay from Hollywood veteran David Koepp. It sticks to a single location – the haunted family home – and the main character is the handheld camera’s ghostly point-of-view. It is the mute witness to everything that happens, roaming wordlessly around the house: up and down the stairs, in and out of the bedrooms, and evidently forbidden to go out back into the garden or out front on to the porch. We see what it sees.</p><p>Presence is conceived on elegant and economically spare lines, dialogue scenes are presented blankly, shot mostly from a distance (the ghost detached and hanging back) and interspersed with blackouts; it is well-acted, disciplined and intimate as a play. But for me it is marred by an early, unsubtle moment of overt supernatural creepiness, which signals a retreat fro

<p>Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary wants European airports to clamp down on pre-flight drinking. But is it really such a problem? There’s only one way to find out …</p><p>It is 10.30am on Thursday at Gatwick, and Jenny and her friend Alison, both 63, are drinking champagne. It’s an elegant scene. They are on a stopover between Barbados and Guernsey, and neither are planning to get drunk and kicked off their connecting flight. Alison describes the unique drinking culture at an airport. “We don’t know what day it is, never mind what time,” she says. “There aren’t any windows, so you can’t tell if it is day or night. Everyone is in a different time zone anyway, so nobody is looking at anyone else thinking, ‘They’re starting a bit early.’”</p><p>The perfect environment, in other words, to enjoy a morning drink.

<p>This wryly comic tale follows the lives of a stunted antihero and his long-suffering girlfriend</p><p>The title character of American author Kate Greathead’s second novel is not just a man; he’s an archetype, a quintessence, a lament in human form. Though decent at heart, George is self-absorbed, inattentive, forgetful, clumsy, indecisive and workshy. A philosophy graduate with&nbsp;vague literary ambitions that never quite come to fruition, he gets by&nbsp;on his good looks and family connections. By contrast, his longsuffering girlfriend, Jenny, is competent and conscientious. The story of their interminable, codependent relationship is told in a wry, third-person narrative foregrounding her plight: George’s laziness “felt like a&nbsp;specific kind of male arrogance … in&nbsp;the beginning, before she knew what to make of it, she had found it charming”; “His absentminded disregard for others, his resistance to&nbsp;doing anything that posed the slightest&nbsp;inconvenience to hi
