We usually meet in discord and play through table top simulator. It typically takes an hour to understand the rules and then most games take two or three more hours to play. We&#39;re looking to expand the group from ~3 regulars to meet new friends and get a more consistent player count. Would you be interested to join us? We are in American (PST + EST) time zones and currently voting on when would be a good time to meet. Previously we were meeting 6pm PST on Thursdays.

The clues were set up in different rooms of the house. I believe there was some kind of illusion used to reveal the weapon in each room, a paper magnifying glass with a special filter would reveal the weapon/clue.</p> <p>The host is now deceased so I cannot ask them.</p> <p>There were extra characters, and I believe the new ones were included as I think I was Dr Orchid. The pictures of the characters on our invites seemed modern and I would recognise the invites/character sheets if I saw them today. This was probably in 2020-2022, in UK.

Naively expecting that the 18+ set of cards would be comparable to some of the worse cards in cards against humanity, I mixed them in. </p> <p>You probably know the stereotype that Germans lack in humor. This game perfectly managed to pin down the gruesome essence of German humor into a bunch of cards. Almost creepy. A fair ammount of the card text made me think of the sex life of my neighbours. There was no violent or actually conventionally shocking content such as pedophilia. Just an awkward explanation of an conservative, slightly sexist middle class Germans sexuality.

I\u2019d like to play it in a similar fashion to how I play the chess app with my friends. A few days to make a move (though it\u2019s often several moves a day), and super nice UI/UX on mobile. It seems the scripting for board games on BGA varies greatly, and some are easier than others.</p> <p>Anyone know any games that work well on mobile?

We started in late december. Our first game was Andor and the second one Lord of the Rings (Knizia), because we were interested in cooperative games and it&#39;s history. This time the group wanted to play some small games (30 minutes per game), and I thought, why not go through every possible player configuration? So a game that is cooperative, a team game, a 1 vs all game, and everyone against eachother. I couldn&#39;t think of more configurations other than maybe 2v2v2, but that&#39;s still just teams. Or maybe differentiate team games that have 1 &#39;leader&#39; per team (Codenames, 30 seconds",

The core concept is you are rolling up cards and trying to completing fan&#39;s wishes. For example a fan&#39;s wish could be &quot;if you roll up 5 apples score 5 points&quot;, and to roll up an apple card you need to go to a specific area on the board where you will be able to pick up an apple card. Each player will also play as a different cousin with different abilities.
