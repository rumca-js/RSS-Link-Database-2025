The villains were entertaining (&quot;CHOO CHOO!&quot; &quot;I know kara-TE!&quot;), the gameplay is a lot of fun while still being true to what Indie would be capable of in the movies. He isn&#39;t a master fighter of martial artist. He&#39;s a brawler, and the brawling in those game feels and sounds good. When it comes to stealth, he isn&#39;t Solid Snake from Metal Gear or Corvo/Emily from Dishonored or Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell. And the stealth is also pretty fun in spite of its simplicity in comparison to other series&#39;. I also like how you are constantly on the look for other melee weapons to use against foes, just like how he does in the movies.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Mine is playing the first Gears of War as a kid on Christmas Day in 2006, about a month after it was released. I was at my uncle’s house with the whole family gathered. Late at night, while all the adults were downstairs talking and relaxing, my cousin and I were upstairs, completely glued to the game, still riding that Christmas high.</p> <p>We played for hours, getting scared at every intense moment and cracking up whenever we accidentally got each other killed. We had to pause the game a few times because we were laughing so hard. It was the best time, and it’s the game that made me fall in love with video games.</p> <p>I remember begging my mom to buy me a 360 just so I could keep playing Gears of War. I didn’t even care about any other games, it was all about Gears. It’s still one of my fondest childhood memories.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vinicius_california"> /u/vinicius_california <

You would have real time control of one soldier but when you were done with them you could swap to another in the squad. All soldiers were on the same map wherever you left them. If I remember right, uncontrolled characters had limited bot control.</p> <p>My googling/gpt&#39;ing has come up blank but I know you hoomans will win the game.</p> <p>Thanks to all of you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rainburger"> /u/rainburger </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://ww
