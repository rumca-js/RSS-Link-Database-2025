<p>Apple’s innovative self-branded credit card, Apple Card, was expected to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1721041/apple-card-the-industry-reacts.html">overturn the existing retail banking industry</a> and transform relationships between bankers and customers. Equipped with generous benefits and unique integration between Apple’s ecosystem and a user’s financial relationships, the card quickly generated many thousands of US users after <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1721172/everything-we-know-about-apple-card-updated-x2.html">its 2019 introduction</a>.</p>



<p>With such a great start, how could it fail? And yet, somehow it found a way. </p>

<p>It’s happened yet again — <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3632904/why-apples-ai-driven-reality-distortion-matters.html">this time to Apple</a>.</p>



<p>Apple recently had to disable AI-generated news summaries in its News app in iOS 18.3. You can guess why: the AI-driven Notification Summaries for the news and entertainment categories in the app occasionally hallucinated, lied, and spread misinformation. </p>



<p>Sound familiar? </p>



<p>Users complained about the summaries, but Apple acted only after a complaint from BBC News, which told Apple that several of its notifications were improperly summarized. These were major errors in some cases. </p>

<p>If you’re a Microsoft 365 subscriber with a Personal or Family subscription, Microsoft just flipped a switch and activated <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1629974/m365-copilot-microsofts-generative-ai-tool-explained.html">Copilot AI features</a> for your account. It’s a new part of your subscription, along with that 1TB of OneDrive storage and access to Office apps like Word and Excel. But there are some <em>big</em> catches — including a price hike and some limits.</p>

<p>Fair warning: This isn’t your average article about what’s happening with all the newfangled AI hullabaloo in this weird and wild world of ours.</p>



<p>Nope — there’ll be no “oohing” and “ahhing” or talk about how systems like Gemini and ChatGPT and their brethren are, like, <em>totally</em> gonna revolutionize the world and change life as we know it.</p>



<p>Instead, I want to look at the state of these generative AI systems through as practical and realistic of a lens as possible — focusing purely on how they work <em>right now</em> and what they’re able to accomplish.</p>



<p>And with that in mind, my friend, there’s no way around it: These things <em>seriously </em>suck.</p>

<p>Perplexity has introduced an API service named Sonar that would allow developers and enterprises to embed the company’s generative AI search technology into their applications.</p>



<p>The company has rolled out two initial tiers – a more affordable and faster option called Sonar, and a higher-priced tier, Sonar Pro, tailored for handling more complex queries.</p>



<p>In a blog post, Perplexity described Sonar API as “lightweight, affordable, fast, and simple to use,” noting that it includes features such as citations and the ability to customize sources. The company said the API is ideal for businesses requiring streamlined question-and-answer functionalities optimized for speed.</p>
