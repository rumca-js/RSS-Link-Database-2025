<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I want my 4b setup as follows</p> <p>HDMI1 for management and the AV jack as output to an RF-modulator that is connected to an retro tv (black and white from the 70s).</p> <p>I am kind of lost, I was hoping to create an second framebuffer (fb1) so that device management is seperated from fb0</p> <p>I’ve tried the following without succes</p> <ol> <li>Configuring HDMI and AV Jack in config.txt: • Enabled enable_tvout=1, sdtv_mode=2, and sdtv_aspect=1 for the AV jack. • Forced hdmi_force_hotplug:0=1 and hdmi_force_hotplug:1=1 to ensure both HDMI ports are active.</li> <li>Using FKMS and KMS Drivers: • FKMS initializes /dev/fb0 for HDMI0 and the AV jack but doesn’t create fb1 for HDMI1. • KMS didn’t resolve the issue either.</li> <li>Direct DRM Tests: • Both /dev/dri/card0 (HDMI0) and /dev/dri/card1 (HDMI1) are present. • I can output to HDMI1 via DRM, but no framebuffer (fb1) exists.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <

## Pi 500 first day - 32 bit OS?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m a longtime Windows &quot;appliance operator&quot; and brand-new to Pi. Got my 500 this morning and have been noodling around with it on and off. </p> <p>First thing I noticed is that an important piece of software I wanted to install was barking back an error about ARM64 compliance. After checking I discovered it was shipped with 32bit. So downloading 64bit atm. </p> <p>I was wondering, since what I&#39;ve read indicates software compliance for 32bit is on the way out, why they would ship w/32bit? Not a complaint. Because it looks like upgrading will be a snap. Just curious.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SundaeAccording789"> /u/SundaeAccording789 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1i70z4c/pi_500_first_day_32_bit_os/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1i70z4c/pi_500_first_day_32_bit_os/">[comment
