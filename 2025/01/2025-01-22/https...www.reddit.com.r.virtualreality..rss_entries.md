<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m considering buying a VR headset in a couple of months. I&#39;ve been reading a lot of articles, a most point at the quest 3. The primary headset that I&#39;ve kinda wanted has been an index but $1000 SEEMS kinda steep with how much people rave about the cheaper quest 3. I&#39;m going to be very clear, I&#39;m not a fan of Meta, and I&#39;m not a fan of the headset not having power pass through. I would love there to be a wired headset that doesn&#39;t require any accounts. Are there alternatives to the quest 3 without those primary 2 issues. Price is flexible up to about $1,000 but I would like it to be under $600. The headset requiring an account is not an option to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/THEcefalord"> /u/THEcefalord </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i7p8v3/shopping_for_vr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I finally pulled the trigger on buying a gaming PC with a 4070 Super and 7800x3d ($1.7k at BB). </p> <p>I had been looking around for a used PC with a 7800x3d at a good price, thinking I could just swap out the GPU with a 5080 or a used 4080/90 after the 50 series drops. Looking around, everyone is selling used hardware for the same price (or even more) than new hardware. So I ended up finding a good price on a new PC that had a good GPU already in it. </p> <p>I&#39;ve never played PCVR, but I&#39;ve heard that you can&#39;t get enough GPU. I&#39;m considering if it would still be worth me trying to snag a 5080 on launch day. From what I&#39;ve seen shopping around for used GPUs recently, it&#39;s cheaper to buy them new than it is to buy them used, so i don&#39;t want to miss out on getting a new one at MSRP. I could turn around and sell the 4070 Super for a few hundred bucks, so I&#39;d be maybe around $650 net for the upgrade from 4070 Super to 50

Move the headset in all angles. With fresnel lenses you will see really really awful distortion of the image and incredible bluriness when you look at an angle, even the slight angle.</p> <p>With GearVR, image remains clear until you angle it too much, and image is SUPER SOLID in all angles, no distortion seen.</p> <p>So, I really don&#39;t understand what he was talking about. </p> <p>Anyway this could be the Quest2 problem, because I do not remember lenses being this awful on Rift with my short time with it.</p> <p>How pancake lenses compare?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all, I have a budget of around 600 USD, maybe a bit more if I can find the perfect one for my needs.</p> <p>I did my research but since I never really used VR headsets before, the amount of information and different products are a bit overwhelming.<br/> I&#39;m looking for a medium headset, right now I&#39;m looking at Quest 3, and Pico 4 Ultra, but the problem is those headsets are standalone capable, so I&#39;m kinda worried if those headsets are too big/heavy. However, Big Screen Beyond is too expansive and unavailable in my country.</p> <p>I&#39;d prefer a headset that has similar specs to Pico 4 Ultra and is PC only. I will be playing DCS and FPS games mostly if this info is relevant. What should I choose? </p> <p>Edit: thank you so much guys, I really appreciate it. I have narrowed down my options to Quest 3 and Pico 4 Ultra. Guess I will just get the one with a better deal in my country</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32
