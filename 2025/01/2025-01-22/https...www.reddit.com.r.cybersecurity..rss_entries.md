Then apparantly, Diffie-Helman is used to generate a symmetrical session key and exchange it between the 2 parties to set up a more performing and faster symmetrical tunnel. However, i was wondering why you need the assymetrical encrypted tunnel beforehand as in diffie-helman, the symmetrical key is obtained by both parties (bob and alice) in such a way that a third party (for example: eve) has no way of obtaining the symmetrical key?
