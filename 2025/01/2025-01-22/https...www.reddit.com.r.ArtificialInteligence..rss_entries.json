It needed to be an image or a video (that has music too), including visuals and a title on visuals. This was the problem no one solved. The problem is for creative work at this point of tech: AI is not reliable. If you&#39;ve had a close experience to get a good output of Midjourney or similar tools. You&#39;d have to first start with a prompt that gives you the idea of output and then refine it +8 times to get an output that aligns with the branding if ever.
