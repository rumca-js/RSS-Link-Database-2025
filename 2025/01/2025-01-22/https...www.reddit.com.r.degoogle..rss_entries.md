## Fastmail: Yes or No

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve seen Fastmail has a lot of good reviews here, and I like the UI, but people were really helpful when I asked about Proton so I&#39;m doing it again. This would be the first time I&#39;ve paid for an email service, but 5-ish bucks a month is still very affordable for me. It also doesn&#39;t require a separate domain. My only fear is that other websites won&#39;t recognise it and bounce my mail back, or not allow me to sign up for their services. I&#39;ve read that happens sometimes with Proton, which is one reason I&#39;ve decided not to go with them. So is fastmail as good as it seems?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whattfisausername"> /u/whattfisausername </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1i7e6lh/fastmail_yes_or_no/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1i7e6lh/fastmail_yes_or_no/">[comments]</a><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im thinking about getting a Honor Magic7 Pro from tradingshenzhen.com . They only sell phones with ChineseRom and Google play store preinstalled.</p> <p>My question is how far can I go with Universal Android Debloater on MagicOS without breaking anything? And how bad is the privacy on MagicOS.</p> <p>I really want this phone and mediocre privacy wont stop me, but very bad privacy will.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dreuzzz"> /u/Dreuzzz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1i795av/privacy_on_chinerom_magicos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1i795av/privacy_on_chinerom_magicos/">[comments]</a></span>
