I don't know much about Breaking Benjamin - but I know there was some excitement about "Awaken" when it came out in October - and last week the band released a video to go with it, so I thought I would take a look. It's epic. Sadly, you wouldn't know that I watched all of it because the thinking computer's copyright detector went into overdrive and limited what could be shown.
