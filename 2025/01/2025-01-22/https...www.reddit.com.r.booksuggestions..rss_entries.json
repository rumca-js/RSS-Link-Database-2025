The mystery/thriller was so obvious that I knew all the plot twist from 15%, and this is a book that a lot of people were praising and recommending, and at first it gave me this rush of &#39;wow I guessed it&#39; but then it was disappointment that nothing hits anymore (I dnf it at 25% when it was too much). With the romance I had a similar experience, there was no chemistry no nothing to make me want to keep reading. And it was not these books fault, it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve encountered",

I want something longer, with lots of stories and adventures, good worldbuilding. Memorable, relatable, multifaceted and complex characters. Lots of emotions and important moments between characters, and their adventures. I don&#39;t want series that has 3 books and that&#39;s it. I read few fantasty series now, but I feel like lots of stories are a bit too simple for me and don&#39;t scratch the itch the same way they did when I was younger. They have simple characters, funny scenes, and morals to educate the reader on good vs bad.</p> <p>I think one of series I that seems like more mature fantasty is The witcher and a song of ice and fire. I do not know any more that have some &quot;ugly&quot; themes like blood, death and sex. I want to read more stories like this. Also more mature themes, not just &quot;this guy bad and we good&quot; and ",

For instance I was reading \u201cif only I had told her\u201d and the male MC who for all of the book has been this sort of \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d type which I have no problem with not a bad character trait at all HOWEVER after walking to the bus stop with some girls (who were barley even acquaintances) he would meet up with his male friend and they would just wait for the bus together. Out of no where his male friend asked him \u201cso which one have you masterbated to\u201d and I\u2019m taken aback because WTF?!? Do women think men think like this??? And I thought he would have been like \u201c bro wtf do you have no respect for women\u201d but no instead he names one and later on ends up dating her and I was just really put off that that was put in the book so",

Looking for epic/sci-fi/fantasy world building series (think, escaping reality)! My goal this year is 20 books! </p> <p>2024 Review: Got hooked on The Empyrean Series and Onyx Storm is at the top of my list to read next! Last year I enjoyed the Red Rising series (third time reading through the entire series as I needed a refresher before reading Light Bringer). Highly recommend as it has become one of my all time favorite series for sure. </p> <p>Also read Otherworld (Jason Segel and Kirsten Miller) and enjoyed that a lot!! Went through a Stephen King phase a few years back, re-vamped that by reading IT in October! Finally caved and read Ready Player Two after going back and forth of whether I just want to stick with RP1. I\u2019m also a sucker for Star Wars (flew through the Thrawn books\u2026new and old). </p> <p>2025: so far I have started Wh",
