However, lately (past few weeks or so) I&#39;m getting a much higher frequency of missing blocks and files that fail to repair with newshosting. Anyone else having this issue as well? It&#39;s definitely not an issue with the indexers since I&#39;m grabbing them from the best indexers. Anyone have a recommendation for a reliable backup provider? I switched from cheaper providers to newshosting because of incomplete issues many years ago, but if there is a more reliable provider nowadays, I don&#39;t mind switching.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deanze1\"> /u/deanze1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1i7nanu/issues_with_missing_blocks_on_newshosting_lately/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
