This is probably it for awhile. The DOJ Civil Rights Division most likely will be sidelined for at least the next four years as Trump returns to office and his not-so-latent desires to impose a police state. Notwithstanding his supporters&#8217; apparent willingness to assault officers who stand between them and a &#8220;stolen&#8221; election, Trump has [&#8230;]

I’m not crazy about writing about a Supreme Court oral argument if the Court is just going to make a fool out of me by doing something they know is wrong and completely divorced from the argument they heard, which laid before them everything they needed to reach a decision that adhered to constitutional precedent.

Well, that didn&#8217;t take long. A short-lived win for civil liberties and the Free Speech Coalition has been undone by the Sixth Circuit Appeals court. The reasoning behind the roll back of the injunction are questionable, to say the least. The Free Speech Coalition&#8217;s case against Tennessee&#8217;s age verification law was solid. Or, at least, [&#8230;]

For years many press outlets (and contrarian engagement pundits like Matt Stoller) tried to argue that the Trump GOP was now &#8220;serious about antitrust reform,&#8221; &#8220;reining in corporate power,&#8221; or &#8220;holding Big Tech Accountable.&#8221; The argument was that because Trumpism claims to be &#8220;populist,&#8221; it could be convinced to implement serious anti-corporatist antitrust reform that [&#8230;]

For those of you who are not football fans, we&#8217;re coming up on Super Bowl season. And, yes, that will surely mean that we will eventually do some posting on the ridiculous way in which the NFL enforces the trademark rights it has, and indeed some it does not have, for the Super Bowl. But [&#8230;]
