They traced it back to a massive tsunami off the coast of Greenland, but the sound went on even after the wave was gone. As in, for nine full days. This is the story of a bizarre set of circumstances that led to this weird wave, and that researchers can tell about our future based on this event.\n\nHosted by: Reid Reimers (he/him)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scish",
