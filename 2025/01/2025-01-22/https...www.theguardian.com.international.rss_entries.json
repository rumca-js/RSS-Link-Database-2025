But Robert Bolt\u2019s play shows that being good could be just as dangerous for one\u2019s head.</p><p>This 1960 drama, which takes us through More\u2019s last years, was immensely successful in its time, transferring to Broadway and adapted for film with Paul Scofield. Jonathan Church\u2019s new touring production is smart and handsome but feels like an old-fashioned history play, creaky in parts though still an ultimately moving portrait of quiet heroism.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jan/22/a-man-for-all-seasons-review-creaky-but-moving-portrait-of-quiet-heroism\">Continue reading...</a>",
