In September of 2023, researchers detected a strange vibration all across the planet. They traced it back to a massive tsunami off the coast of Greenland, but the sound went on even after the wave was gone. As in, for nine full days. This is the story of a bizarre set of circumstances that led to this weird wave, and that researchers can tell about our future based on this event.
