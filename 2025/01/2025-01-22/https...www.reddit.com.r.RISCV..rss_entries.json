        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Greetings!</p> <p>What&#39;s the fastest system-level RISC-V emulator around right now? It should be able to emulate rv64g and ideally run FreeBSD (though if it doesn&#39;t, I can try to port it). The emulator should be capable of multi-core operation.</p> <p>The goal is to bulk-build software on and for RISC-V. We have about 32000 software packages (the FreeBSD ports collection) to build, which takes around two weeks natively on an amd64 box (Skylake microarchitecture), so fast emulation is crucial.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FUZxxl\"> /u/FUZxxl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i7mxil/fastest_riscv_emulator_around/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1i7mxil/fastest_riscv_emulator_around/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have tried linux minimally in the form of wsl. I have been thinking between the milk v duo s and the raspberry pi zero 2w. I want an sbc that can train extremely rudimentary ml models (eg. using tensorflow lite or pytorch). It would be nice if i could also use the boards as test dummies for malware, by running old os&#39;s like windows vista or windows xp and the like. I have a television that i can out put to ( i have herd that the milk v duo s dosent have hdmi). I see many ters flying around like eMMc, sram and such. So it would also be nice if any of you could familiarize myself with, or lead me to any resources for learning these terms.
