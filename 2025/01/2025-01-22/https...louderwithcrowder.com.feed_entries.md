The dude has cost me way too much money over the years, leading the censorship wing of the Democrat Party. <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/is-mark-zuckerberg-a-trump-supporter" target="_blank">He has A LOT more sins to atone for</a> before we believe he is on board with the "cultural shift" back to free speech. As long as there is a single blue-haired freak on Facebook pressing buttons and writing algorithms to throttle any viewpoint they don't like, Zuck doesn't get to sit with us. Okay? Okay.

	In fairness to Zuckerberg, his transformation into a real boy has slowly happened over time.
