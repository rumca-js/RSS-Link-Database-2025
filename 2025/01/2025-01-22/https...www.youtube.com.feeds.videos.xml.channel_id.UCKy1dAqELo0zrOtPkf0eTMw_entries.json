        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nFormer Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, had high praise for Sony's Astro Bot. At the New York Game Awards, Fils-Aim\u00e9 said Astro Bot 'almost outdid Nintendo' at making a fun 3D platformer for all ages. Astro Bot won Game of the year at the event, as well as taking home Game of the Year at The Game Awards in December. In other news, Insomniac's CEO, Ted Price, leaving the industry after 30 years with the company. He hasn't announced what's next, but he did announce his replacements: Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern. Finally, Marvel has announced a new crossover in the Spider-Man comics. Spidey will be taking on Godzilla in a story that takes place during the Secret Wars era of Marvel Comics (the Secret Wars from the 1980s, not the 2015 crossover).\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nMicrosoft has revealed the next wave of games coming to Xbox Game Pass, and there's a little something for everyone. Sniper Elite: Resistance, Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders, Gigantic: Rampage Edition, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (now on Game Pass Standard), and more are hitting the service. In other news, Marvel Snap is back online after it was temporarily Thanos-snapped out of existence as part of the Tiktok ban. Developer Second Dinner will be working to find a new publisher to avoid any disruptions like this in the future. And finally, Sony's Bend Studio is still working on stuff even after their latest project has been canned. Bend Studio's new game was to be a live-service multiplayer title, but as part of Sony's recent purge of live-service games that aren't Helldivers, Bend's game was cancelled.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Xbox",
