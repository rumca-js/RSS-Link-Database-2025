I just got back from CES (and recovered!) 
This year was quite interesting- LOTS of new VR headsets. I can confidently say that 2025 is certainly the year of 4k micro OLEDs in VR headsets with multiple new devices on their way. 

From new controllers, to gloves to omnidirectional VR shoes, we got a lot to cover!
