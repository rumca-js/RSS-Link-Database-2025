Then apparantly, Diffie-Helman is used to generate a symmetrical session key and exchange it between the 2 parties to set up a more performing and faster symmetrical tunnel. However, i was wondering why you need the assymetrical encrypted tunnel beforehand as in diffie-helman, the symmetrical key is obtained by both parties (bob and alice) in such a way that a third party (for example: eve) has no way of obtaining the symmetrical key?

Sort of going too vague here for plausible deniability..since I\u2019m pretty sure my employer stalks.</p> <p>Anyways I got this job. Related to the gov a bit. It\u2019s a mess \u2014 emergencies happen everyday, I can\u2019t carry out my job functions because it\u2019s so team dependent, and daily check ins. Of course following the clearance guidelines\u2014no fun :( I have like 5 roles and I\u2019m not interested in any them. The only positive is the pay. Low six figures, but hey six figures! </p> <p>Idk I got this other job lined up. It\u2019s something I used to do , that I enjoy and I\u2019m good at. Only downside is the pay. I\u2019ll be around $67k . Back to the private sector, freedom once again, but competition. And the low pay. The pay is low because it\u2019s the sexiest position you can think of\u2014it\u2019s the thing everybody wants to do. </p> <p>Have anyone of yous went from private&gt;public&gt;back to private? Ever been through this? Any suggestions, what did you do? </p> </div><!-- SC_",

I have five years of experience in the field, having worked for an MSSP, with my previous role primarily focused on Splunk as a Cyber Security Specialist.</p> <p>However, I\u2019ve been facing challenges with rejections due to my visa status.
