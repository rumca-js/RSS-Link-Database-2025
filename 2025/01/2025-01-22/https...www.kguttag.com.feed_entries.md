I wanted to drop a quick note that I am going to be at AR/VR/MR 2025 next week and am looking forward to meeting people and seeing technology. If you want to meet with me, please email meet@kgontech.com. While mentioning AR/VR/MR, I thought it would be good to give my perspective on the conferences I plan to attend (or in the case of CES attended) this year, including CES, SID Display Week, and Augmented World Expo (AWE).
