        "description": "<p>Ahead of the release of Gourav Mohanty\u2019s Dance of Shadows, I read the first book in the series, Sons of Darkness (shoutout to Micaela Alcaino for the mesmerizing cover artwork). Mohanty says the series is inspired by an Indian epic poem, the Mahabharata, and reimagines its characters in the bleak, nihilistic realm of Aryavrat. The central plot surrounds a war between the city of Mathura, led by the shepherd-turned-usurper Krishna, and the emperor of Magadh, Jarasandh, who seeks revenge for the deaths of his daughters during the uprising. The book takes place during a one year armistice in the war, which kickstarts a continent&#8217;s worth of clever political scheming in the interim. Swirling beneath are prophecies, the return of immortal beings, and the rise of the foretold Son of Darkness. There is a big cast and many POVs\u2014you may need to bookmark the Dramatis Personae. Mohanty\u2019s author\u2019s note explicitly thanks George R.R. Martin for writing Game of Thrones, and Sons of Darkness",
