Some of my favorite authors are china mi\u00e9ville, Greg Egan, and Jeff vandermeer with some of my favorite books being Blindsight, The southern Reach Trilogy, Perdido Street Station, and pretty much any hard sci-fi. I\u2019m looking to get into some more mentally challenging fantasy books that are mostly low on the romance. Would love some cool magic in the books too! I have 4 credits on audible as well as a Barnes and noble gift card so both audiobook and physical book recommendations are much appreciated. Plus!

I know this series is not particularly popular here, but as someone who really enjoyed <em>Fourth Wing</em> despite it being outside what I typically read (Abercrombie, Sanderson, Dinniman, Hobb, Fonda Lee, Ken Liu, Ruocchio, Brennan, Kingfisher, etc.) I need to get some negative thoughts out about this new release. Again, I really enjoyed <em>Fourth Wing</em>, so if you didn&#39;t, either this review is not for you or you might enjoy watching me rant about this book LOL</p> <p><em>Fourth Wing</em> was a book that really worked for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I acknowledge the flaws: the worldbuilding made little sense, the writing was mediocre at its best and cringey at its worst, and most of all Violet&#39;s horny thoughts were the literal worst thing I&#39;ve ever read. HOWEVER, all the same, I found the character banter charming, the protagonist&#39;s relationships to her family members really compelling,",

He\u2019s incredibly consistent in quality and can successfully write across so many genres and styles.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never really been the biggest fan of horror, at least not in novel form. For that reason, Stephen King hasn\u2019t clicked with me yet. I\u2019d love to find something of his that works for me, but reading <em>The Shining</em> and <em>The Dead Zone</em> didn\u2019t quite do it.</p> <p>I discovered Dan Simmons through the <em>Hyperion Cantos</em>. Science fiction is my genre\u2014it speaks to me\u2014so it\u2019s no surprise that <em>Hyperion</em> left an incredible first impression. I followed it up with <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> but haven\u2019t yet continued the series with <em>Endymion</em> or <em>The Rise of Endymion</em>. This isn\u2019t because of a lack of interest; I just haven\u2019t gotten to them yet. Then I read <em>Ilium</em>, which blew my mind. I loved it, though, like with <em>Endymion</em>, I haven\u2019t read its ",

Even if you don&#39;t read reviews and just hang out in discussion spaces like reddit, is there a particular complaint someone else could make of a book you haven&#39;t read that perks your ears up as a positive in your mind? </p> <p>For me it&#39;s when someone calls a fantasy book slow or boring or says that nothing happens. I love a slow plot. That tells me it might be very character driven or maybe it&#39;s political and it&#39;s all conversations instead of action scenes. It still might be a boring, slow book after all, but hearing that from someone else as a complaint makes me curious if it&#39;s actually a perfect book for me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ComradeCupcake_\"> /u/ComradeCupcake_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i6y9dn/what_complaint_about_a_book",

It&#39;s about a male teen soccer player &amp; friend (possibly British) who somehow find a portal to hell and become gladiators. Only other weird details I remember are they would eat a weird nutrient slime thing lol, and I think he meets the devil. I can&#39;t remember the name or author unfortunately.
