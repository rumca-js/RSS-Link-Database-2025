It was a 3D strategy/simulation game where you controlled a group of adorable, mouse-sized aliens.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I remember: \u2022 The aliens weren\u2019t scary at all\u2014they were cute. \u2022 They lived in human environments (like houses) and survived by eating leftover food scraps. \u2022 There were small, rotating, Ferris wheel-like stations that served as their sleeping pods or resting areas. \u2022 The game had a lighthearted and fun atmosphere\u2014nothing dark or creepy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried searching everywhere, but no luck so far. Does anyone know the game I\u2019m talking about? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pieceoflion\"> /u/pieceoflion </a> <br/> ",

There are apparently 12 different models that were released between 1987 and 1994. I was shocked to find that every single one of them uses the same processor(a). It would be like never releasing a snes, but instead making 12 differently shaped versions of the NES and charging 300-400 dollars for each of them. No wonder they went out of business. Was Hudson Soft allergic to making improvements to the HuC6280 chip? There has to be a story behind why every other console company was trying to innovate and they didn&#39;t bother. Their CD games look the same as their early hu carts.
