<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(TLDR: CreamAPI broke, game wont boot with it, will boot without it, how fix?)</p> <p>Hey there, i have legit forza horizon 5 on steam shared from my friends librabry, but he has no DLCs so i got creamAPI, ive been using it since October with zero issues and suddenly like a week ago, the game displayed a screen like if i didnt have a Rally DLC (which i had cracked ofc) and then the game crashed, since then the game wont boot past the tiny splash screen in the center of the screen, when i disable CreamAPI the game works like it should but im afraid of Ban since i own DLC cars which wouldnt be available if i played without DLCs, ive tried reinstalling the game multiple times and even checking the integrity of the files, yet nothing happened, i dont wanna go back to pirated forza to download massive updates for hours every time one comes out instead of just playing and not caring like now, any alternatives to CreamAPI or any way to fix it? thanks</p> </

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, So recently I downloaded LIS 2 for my friends to experience the story, for the first 3 episodes it worked perfectly and everything, then we stopped played for a few months, for some reason my files were deleted, so i reinstalled it from IGG-GAMES, extracted all the files and ran it, sometimes it would run in the background tasks in my task manager, then flash black on my screen then would close entirely, if i opened it through the troubleshooter running the recommended settings windows gives me, and occasionally it would open instead of the black screen, but it would have no audio and then when i press continue on the last episode we played, it would run the loading screen for 2 minutes then either crash or freeze. I deleted the files and downloaded Steamunlocked&#39;s files but it would also do the same thing :/</p> <p>I love this game, and i would want to buy the game but buying a whole game for 2 episodes is too much :c</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --

I&#39;ve tried both blocking NFS heat in firewall, as well as allowing it acess.<br/> 3. I&#39;ve tried compatability mode in both win 7 as well as win 8 mode.
