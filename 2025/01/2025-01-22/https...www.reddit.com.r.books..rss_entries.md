<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The hearts, emotions, powers, and male organs of characters have been thrumming in the last 8 books I’ve read. I always thought thrumming was a sound and I always end up imagining a sound when I hear that word. It seems to be quite popular in fantasy books. I first started noticing it in the works of TJ Klune. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lostinspacescream"> /u/lostinspacescream </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i7kuny/whats_with_all_the_thrumming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i7kuny/whats_with_all_the_thrumming/">[comments]</a></span>

## Advice on comparing

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I just wanted to ask for some advice. I love reading so much but I’m a relatively slow reader. I can read about 40-50 books per year depending on their size. And that’s only because I usually have a lot of free time. Anyway, I have a book club. There are three other women in my club and I would consider them my best friends. For the month of January, two of them have read 6 books so far and the other has read 9. I have only finished 2. I love reading and I know I shouldn’t compare, but it’s so hard not to. We have a book podcast and it’s hard for me to feel like I have time to read the books that I want to read (because I’m reading books for our podcast). Anyway, advice for not comparing? And advice for how to read faster? Haha</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Such-Study-5329"> /u/Such-Study-5329 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i7h2no/advice_on_compa

## George RR Martin doesn't understand logistics; JK Rowling doesn't understand politics; Stephen King doesn't care about Plot. What are other authors who are successful despite weaknesses in their writing?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Having weak areas of writing doesn&#39;t exclude an author from writing good books. Three (in)famous writers are George RR Martin, Stephen King, and JK Rowling. Their books show that they have either a lack of understanding or interest in certain areas, yes their stories have become famous.<br/> George RR Martin doesn&#39;t understand how distance or money work. The value of gold fluctuates wildly from book to book and the distance between things is improbable given the travel time and level of technology.<br/> JK Rowling doesn&#39;t understand politics, because the government of the wizarding world is so hopelessly corrupt that it couldn&#39;t function, at least not to the level that it does.<br/> Stephen King doesn&#39;t care about plot. Some of his best books, including IT and the Dark Tower series, have weak or macgufinny plots.<br/> What are some other examples, of authors who are famous and successful despite weak aspects?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON
