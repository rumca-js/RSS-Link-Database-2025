  <p id="VKfKqu">Earthblade, the next game from the developers of <em>Celeste</em>, has been canceled. The fantasy-inspired game got its first trailer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23500114/earthblade-trailer-extremely-ok-games-the-game-awards-2022">in late 2022</a>, and the game would have let you explore a “free-roaming, dynamically-loading map,” Extremely OK Games’ Maddy Thorson said at the time. But the team decided to cancel the game in December after a team conflict and because of the pressure of trying to follow up on <em>Celeste</em>, Thorson says <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">in a post detailing what h

  <p id="hhMeV0">The megapixel race isn’t over if you ask Canon. Today, the company <a href="https://global.canon/en/news/2025/20250122.html">announced a new 35mm full-frame CMOS sensor</a> with a resolution of 410 megapixels. That’s 24,592 x 16,704 pixels and a resolution that’s equivalent to 24K — or 12 times the resolution of 8K and 198 times the resolution of HD.</p>
<p id="muawsw">It’s the ”largest number of pixels ever achieved in a 35mm full-frame sensor,” according to Canon, but don’t expect the company to introduce it on its consumer-ready digital cameras. It’s designed for surveillance, medicine, and other industrial “applications that demand extreme

  <p id="QdI86O">Google’s AI assistant Gemini is now able to carry out tasks across multiple apps in a single interaction, in an update announced today alongside the launch of Samsung’s new Galaxy S25 series. Those phones are also Samsung’s first to feature Gemini as the default on-device assistant, relegating Bixby to the app drawer.

  <p id="Kqhvtx">The “Ultra” model in Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup is typically the phone crammed full of every feature the company could think of. But this year, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is actually taking a step <em>backward</em> with the S Pen. The motion gestures and useful remote camera shutter function have been removed, and the stylus is back to being just a stylus.

  <p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jKdy3D">The second season of <em>Silo</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295488/silo-season-2-review-apple-tv-plus">a postapocalyptic thriller on Apple TV Plus</a> — has wrapped up, and the finale was the show at its very best.

It left me excited about what’s coming next — but also wary that the show is running out of time to tell the full story.</p>
