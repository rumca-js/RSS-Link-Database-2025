## Best VPNs for torrenting 2025: Speed, privacy, and security matter

<p>Torrenting, or P2P (peer-to-peer) file sharing, is a convenient way to download large files quickly. But it isn’t without its risks. Not only is there the risk of accidentally downloading a malicious file or malware, but there’s a privacy risk as well — your ISP can see all your online activity and they usually don’t take too kindly to torrenting. </p>



<p>That’s why it’s imperative that you use a VPN while doing any torrenting or P2P file sharing. A VPN can keep your connection private and encrypt your data so that unwanted prying eyes — cybercriminals, overbearing ISPs, or nosy government watchdogs — can’t monitor your online activity. (See “<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2440328/can-a-vpn-really-hide-all-of-your-torrent-activity.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2440328/can-a-vpn-really-hide-all-of-your-torrent-

## Nvidia says its new RTX 50 cards won’t melt power plugs this time

<p>If you recall a couple of years and several centuries ago when the RTX 4090 launched, a bunch of them melted. Okay, that’s hyperbolic, but a small but notable number of 40-series cards had <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1372988/heres-what-we-know-about-the-geforce-rtx-4090-12vhpwr-cables-melting.html">issues with the new 12VHPWR connector setup</a> that caused cards to short out and fail. Nvidia says that won’t happen with the new RTX 50 series.</p>



<p>Company representatives said as much to an audience at the RTX AI PC Day (woof, alphabet soup) conference in South Korea. According to <a href="https://quasarzone.com/bbs/qn_report/views/444251">QuasarZone.com</a> (machine translated, spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-claims-melting-connector-issue-has-been-resolved-geforce-rtx-50-should-not-to-be-affected">VideoCardz.com</a

<p>If you want an easy way to connect your laptop, phone, or tablet to your TV or an external monitor, this Anker USB-C-to-HDMI adapter is a great solution, especially now that it’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Aluminum-Pixelbook-Compatible-Thunderbolt/dp/B07THJGZ9Z/">only $12 on Amazon</a>. That’s a lovely 33 percent discount off its $18 MSRP.</p>



<p>So, for example, if you have an iPad Pro and you want to watch videos on the big screen, this adapter lets you connect to your TV via HDMI cable. Or if you have a MacBook Air and want to play Jackbox games with your family, you can play on the TV with this adapter.</p>



<p>It’s especially useful for ultra-thin laptops, which tend to lack ports, especially the bigger ones like full-sized HDMI. With an adapter like this, you can hook up an external monitor or even a projector for presentations. When

<p>Following CES 2025, the newest and arguably coolest thin-and-light laptop on the block is the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2567787/asus-takes-on-the-macbook-air-with-the-zenbook-a14.html">Asus Zenbook A14</a>. That one doesn’t appear to be in anyone’s hands yet, but it already has a new challenger. The Fujitsu FMV Note U is an incredible 1.87 pounds (848 grams) and, perhaps even more impressively, it’s running an Intel CPU.</p>



<p>Asus and other laptop makers have been leaning on Qualcomm’s Arm-based Snapdragon X architecture to get laptops lighter as of late. But Fujitsu is sticking to Intel with a Core Ultra 7 258V in the base model. That stunning sub-two-pound weight class is well below the Zenbook A14, though I have to point out that its battery life estimate is a bit of a cheat.</p>

<p>Up until now, whenever you signed into your Microsoft account, you’ve been asked whether you want to remain signed in. This is typical for most sites and services, where you need to manually tick a checkbox to express that you want to stay logged in the next time you visit.</p>



<p>Starting next month, Microsoft is doing away with that. Going forward, users who sign into a Microsoft account will automatically remain signed in until they manually sign out.</p>

<p>Here’s something no one ever thinks about when choosing their favorite software… just how easy is it to set up on another PC?</p>



<p>You’ve probably never thought about it, but there’s a reason that both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are the world’s most popular Windows PC browsers. Chrome owns about <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/north-america">58 percent of the North American browser market</a>, and there’s a reason for it. </p>



<p>After you sign up on one PC, reproducing your passwords, favorites, and more on subsequent PCs is as easy as logging in. But on competing browsers? Not so much.</p>



<p>That hit home recently when I was trying to sync an instance of Vivaldi, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/696762/6-reasons-to-quit-chrome-and-switch-to-vivaldi-browser.html">one of my favorite “alt browsers,”</a>
