<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like using Windows and I would love to start using Linux as my main os in the future, thats why I am making this post as self-notes with community feedback to someday achieve this goal.</p> <p>I tried switching many times but always faced issues. This time, Linux was much more stable than my last try and I feel very confident about the future of Linux distros in general.</p> <p>Things I like about Linux:</p> <ul> <li>You are in control of the OS</li> <li>More performance, less ram usage, less battery drain</li> <li>You don&#39;t need WSL (good for developers)</li> <li>Lots of customization and very nice looking (KDE Plasma)</li> </ul> <p>Things that improved since last try to switch:</p> <ul> <li>The system is much more stable and doesn&#39;t freeze</li> <li>I was able to run wayland for the first time and it was very easy to switch</li> </ul> <p>Things that made me revert back to Windows:</p> <ul> <li>Handling of hybrid GPUs is a nightma

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am running Mint with 6.8.0-51 kernel version. Especially when the laptop is running on battery, it goes read only randomly or freezes, I have HP elitebook 640 g9. Had the same issue with Ubuntu 22.04 on different kernel version from 5.19 to 6.8. I thought it was caused by the cheap ssd, so I bought a new WD blue ssd, but I guess it was wrong call. Now I have no idea what to do, been trying to solve this issue almost a year. Do any of you guys experienced this issue or any idea what could be the reason. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKeeperOfTheLigth"> /u/TheKeeperOfTheLigth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i7gxwl/read_only_fs_and_random_freezing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i7gxwl/read_only_fs_and_random_freezing/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am currently looking for an alternative to my Windows 11. I only use my computer to play (only on Steam) and do web browsing.<br/> I have already used Ubuntu since version 12 but I am not completely convinced because of the choices that were made: Snap, and the choice of Amazon, I used Debian and Kali (except video games) for my studies and I like these distros, I recently wanted to change my Windows 11 for Garuda but I found this distro buggy and unstable.<br/> Mint was also really good but I had to tune a lot of things to be able to play.<br/> I recently changed my setup to a 1920p laptop setup with two monitors, an AMD Ryzen 7 processor and a 4060 GPU. What OS do you recommend? </p> <p>Although I am not convinced by Proton, I would still like to use it but with a minimum of tinkering. I play games like GTA, MFS, D4, POE, Forza, CS, Darktide, SpaceMarine2, FF, Death Stranding.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="http
