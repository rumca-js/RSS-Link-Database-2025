Im totally out of the whole Amiga thing as i sold my A4000 about 25 years ago. Its loaded right up, picasso, Aridane network card, another card i cant remember! and the Jewel in the crown a 68060/PPC accelerator. There is corrosion around the battery and along the bottom memory bank. Ive not had the chance to get it apart but i will on the weekend. There a couple of large bags of games along with a load of Amiga freeware CD&#39;s which ill have tomorrow.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2mxk5fwt1mee1.jpg?width=4000",

All setup and working as a crazy fast 68020.</p> <p>Dumb question number 1: can the pistorm on an Amiga 600 still emulate say a 68040? If so, what&#39;s the easiest and quickest way to change which cpu is being emulated? I&#39;d hoped to be able to pop the SD card out, edit a text file and off I go. But sadly not.</p> <p>Dumb question number 2: is there any benefit whatsoever to doing that? I suppose it would be faster, but I doubt there&#39;s much outside of demos that would take advantage, especially without an AGA machine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LJBrooker\"> /u/LJBrooker </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i7aqt0/change_pistorm_600_cpu/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i7aqt0/change_pistorm_600_cpu/\">[comments]</a></span>",
