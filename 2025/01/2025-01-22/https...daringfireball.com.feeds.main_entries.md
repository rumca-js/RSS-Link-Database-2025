<p>Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Click the amount you wish to contribute, then click Donate and
Apple will transfer 100% of your contribution to the American Red
Cross in support of people impacted by the 2025 Southern
California wildfires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple has prominent links to its Red Cross donation form on the web and in the App Store. They’ve been doing this after catastrophes and disasters <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/27/nepal-red-cross-itunes">around the world</a> for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/13/red-cross">a long time</a>. On the surface, it’s great because it’s so easy. Apple already has your saved credentials so it takes just a few taps or clicks to donate. You can measure the time to donate in seconds, not minutes.</p>

<p>But an under-appreciated aspect of Apple acting as a front-end to the Red Cross is that your donation remains completely private. There’s quite a lot of small print on the donation screen, which s

<p>From a multi-byline profile of Stephen Miller in The New York Times last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Miller told Mr. Zuckerberg that he had an opportunity to help
reform America, but it would be on President-elect Donald J.
Trump’s terms. He made clear that Mr. Trump would crack down on
immigration and go to war against the diversity, equity and
inclusion, or D.E.I., culture that had been embraced by Meta and
much of corporate America in recent years.</p>

<p>Mr. Zuckerberg was amenable. He signaled to Mr. Miller and his
colleagues, including other senior Trump advisers, that he would
do nothing to obstruct the Trump agenda, according to three people
with knowledge of the meeting, who asked for anonymity to discuss
a private conversation. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would instead focus
solely on building tech products.</p>

<p>Mr. Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl
Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that
encouraged employees’ self-express

## Legal Nerdery on Trump’s TikTok Executive Order

<p>Alan Rozenshtein, writing for Lawfare:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Apple and Google maintained their compliance, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online">Oracle and
Akamai made the remarkable decision to resume services</a>,
despite facing potentially catastrophic liability rates. Shortly
after his inauguration on Jan. 20, Trump followed through by
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-orders-75-day-pause-on-tiktok-law-enforcement">issuing an executive order</a> that suspended PAFACAA
enforcement for 75 days and attempted to provide retroactive
protection for any violations before and during the
nonenforcement period.</p>

<p>TikTok’s tech partners face a key executive power question: Can
they rely on Trump’s promises not to enforce PAFACAA? If companies
continue providing services to TikTok, can Trump later change his
mind and pursue enforcement actions against them for all
accumulated violations? Could a future administration enfor

## Next Week’s iOS 18.3 and MacOS 15.3 Updates Will Enable Apple Intelligence During Onboarding

<p>From Apple’s developer release notes for iOS 18.3, now at release candidate (RC) status:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be
enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have
access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their
devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to
navigate to the Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri Settings pane and turn
off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple
Intelligence features on their device.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about this decision. It’s pretty obvious that Apple Intelligence has a slew of shortcomings. It’s the nature of the beast, though, that it’s always going to have some shortcomings. <em>Human</em> intelligence, which to date remains
