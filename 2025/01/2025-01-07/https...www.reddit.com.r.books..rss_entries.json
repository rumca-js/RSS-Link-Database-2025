        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently read &quot;Laughing Boy: A Navajo Love Story,&quot; written in 1929 by Oliver La Farge, because I enjoy historical fiction. The book has been banned in some schools, which led to a Supreme Court case, and it has received many positive reviews on Goodreads.com. I suppose it was considered progressive for its time. The author, a white anthropologist, highlighted certain injustices, such as the forced removal of Native American children to American schools, which aimed to &quot;Americanize&quot; them. However, I found the overall tone to be condescending, and the dialogue reminded me of old Western movies. Like some other readers, I question why this book won a Pulitzer Prize. Has anyone else read this book? <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19706561-laughing-boy\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19706561-laughing-boy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SteveRT78\"> /u/SteveR",

Recently read this novel - it&#39;s entertaining although not of same quality as originals. Father Brown (from G.K. Chesterton&#39;s stories) is a priest who doubles as amatuer detective, using a more psychological style than Sherlock. Focus is on Sherlock for most of the book, with Watson narrating as usual. Father Brown delivers a crucial twist at the end - his side of detective work is mostly in the background, I wish his side also was shown more on the page :)</p> <p>Have any of you read it - what do you think about it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sohang-3112\"> /u/sohang-3112 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hvvmoo/night_watch_a_crossover_novel_sherlock_holmes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.redd",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve lately really been into Time Loop books. There have been some fantastic ones that I&#39;ve found and I find that despite how well it has been used in TV and movies that it can really be effective in books. Some great examples are How To Be A Dark Lord and Die Trying by Django Wrexler or The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North. </p> <p>When it comes to my least favourite...I&#39;m not sure WHY but I absolutely hate in books when conflict arises because of a case of mistaken identity. Whether it is someone pretending to be someone else or a long lost twin or <em>whatever</em> I just cannot stand it. I immediately start getting anxious. </p> <p>What tropes do you enjoy and what ones do you detest?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/moegreeb\"> /u/moegreeb </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1hvrqpx/what_are_your_favourite_and_least_favourite/\">[link",
