<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was a &quot;hacker&quot; back in the mid-2000s but as I entered the professional world and got caught up in the life of professional coding, I fell out of the loop.</p> <p>Now, two decades later, I want to get caught up and start playing again. What are some good places to start for filling a 20 year gap of infosec and exploitation knowledge?</p> <p>I know it&#39;s a long shot but can&#39;t hurt to ask....</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/am_i_the_rabbit"> /u/am_i_the_rabbit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hw0oi8/coming_back_after_20_years/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1hw0oi8/coming_back_after_20_years/">[comments]</a></span>
