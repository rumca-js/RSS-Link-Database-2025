On the same Raspberry I am also running AdGuardHome.</p> <p>As you will know both NPM and AGH require port 443, so I moved AGH to 4430 (I mapped AGH port in docker to 4430:443).

So I thought to proxy AGH through NPM too.</p> <p>Sadly I can get ONLY the UI of AGH to work through NPM, infact I can correctly reach it to SIMPLY mydomain.lan and it works. But if, for example, I set Firefox DoH to use ONLY mydomain.lan, the DNS does not work, I have to put :4430 again to make it work. Basically it looks like DNS requests are not working.</p> <p>Maybe

Before I put in the extra effort to dockerize it and share it, I’m curious if this is something others would find useful—or if there’s already a similar solution out there that I’ve missed.</p> <p>The Problem</p> <p>I run several services on my home server, exposing them online through Traefik (e.g., movies.myserver.com, baz.myserver.com). These services are defined in a docker-compose.yml file.</p> <p>The issue? I often forget what services I’ve set up and what their corresponding URLs are.</p> <p>I’ve tried apps like Homer and others as a directory, but I never keep them updated.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long story short, I&#39;m downloading a few YouTube channels for my kids to stream via Plex. I&#39;ve explored yt-dlp, ytdlp-sub, and tubesync. I&#39;m leaning towards TubeSync for the simplicity of the web ui but I&#39;m not opposed to using an alternative. </p> <p>I setup TubeSync to output these files in 1080p + AVC1 (H.264) + MP4A to optimize streaming on older hardware. The challenge is the files are output to MKV and the Plex TV Shows library doesn&#39;t pick up the title metadata. I can do a quick conversion to MP4 using ffmpeg, which solves that issue, but it adds an extra step to the process.</p> <p>Questions:</p> <ol> <li>Is there a way to get TubeSync to output to MP4?</li> <li>If there is a simpler method using 1 of the alternative tools? I&#39;ve written several scripts for yt-dlp but the output always takes longer than TubeSync as I&#39;m encoding from VP90 to H264. I must have something wrong.</li> </ol> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div

## Load balancing or redundancy via free OCI tier?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about my home server, and how... alone it is. I&#39;ve considered running redundant docker containers on a second machine (on a second circuit in my house), and utilizing a reverse proxy, or some similar mechanism for failover redundancy, but using OCI to do the failover and routing. I&#39;m assuming OCI&#39;s uptime significantly exceeds mine, and that this simple function is enough to stay within the free tier.</p> <p>Does any self hoster have redudancy in place? If so, how are you managing it? I can&#39;t do it at the DNS level, so I&#39;ll still be beholden to a single point of failure at my router (single IP in), but I&#39;m thinking more about redundancy at my physical server.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rob_allshouse"> /u/rob_allshouse </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hvgut5/load_balancing_or_redundancy_via_free_oci_tier/">[

Is there anyway to do this? Could it send me an email? Or at least an app notification on my Mac or PC?</p> <p>Anyone know how to set this up? I guess setting up some sort of notification in Amazon AWS S3 is an option as well, although sometimes AWS confuses me but I do like to tinker so it&#39;s certainly an option.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jwintyo"> /u/jwintyo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hvdzzd/kopiaui_is_there_a_way_to_have_failed_snapshots/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hvdzzd/kopiaui_is_there_a_way_to_have_failed_snapsh
