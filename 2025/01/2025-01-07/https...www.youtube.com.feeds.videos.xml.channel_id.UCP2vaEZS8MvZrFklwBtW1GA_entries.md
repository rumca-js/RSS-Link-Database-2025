Bathroom sink removal tips…as I get older I try to make demo easier. For example, I remove the doors, drawers, and sink. Then I score the silicone and remove screws holding the sink top to the wall/cabinet. The final step is to take out the screws holding the cabinet to the wall. All this reduces excessive damage and makes demo more efficient 👍🏽🔥#demo #bathroomreno #newbathroom #homerenovations
