Nvidia announced a TON of cool stuff at their keynote last night, from robotics partnerships to digital twins and Cosmos. But what I was excited about, was of course the new RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 launch details. And then I was even MORE excited when I got to try the 5090 and DLSS 4 for myself.
