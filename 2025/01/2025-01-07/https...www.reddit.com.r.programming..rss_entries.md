<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Rustaceans! 🤩 I&#39;m excited to share my new project, Raddy, with you all. It&#39;s an autodiff (automatic differentiation) library for Rust that I&#39;ve been working on. I&#39;m still in the process of developing it, but I wanted to share it with the community and get some feedback. 😃</p> <h3>What is Raddy?</h3> <p>Raddy is a Rust library that provides automatic differentiation capabilities. It allows you to compute gradients and Hessians of functions with weak coupling to deep learning frameworks. I started this project because I wanted to bring some of the functionality of TinyAD to Rust. 🚀</p> <h3>Why Another Autodiff?</h3> <p>In the autodiff space, both forward and backward modes have their uses. But for numerous non-deep-learning tasks like physics simulation and geometry processing, forward mod has an edge. It computes derivatives as we move forward through the computational graph. This is great for small and per-stencil problems. Raddy
