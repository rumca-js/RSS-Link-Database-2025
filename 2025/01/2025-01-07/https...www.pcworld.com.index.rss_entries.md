<p>A day after launching the most hotly anticipated product in the PC world, the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2569484/surprise-nvidias-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-cost-less-than-you-thought.html">Nvidia GeForce 50-series family of graphics cards</a>, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang appeared on stage at CES to answer reporters’ questions.</p>



<p>A key one: In a world where AI is increasingly used to generate or interpolate frames, is the end result a world in which PC graphics is <em>entirely</em> AI generated? No, Huang replied.</p>



<p>There’s a reason we asked Huang the question. Nvidia says that while<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1662185/what-is-dlss-3-nvidia-geforce-rtx-ai-feature-explained.html"> DLSS 3 could inject AI-generated frames</a> between every GPU-rendered frame, DLSS 4 can infer three full frames off of a single

<p>Do gamers need SSDs? Inside their PCs, certainly, that’s one of the easiest recommendations for a speedier computer. What about <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/406861/best-external-drives.html">portable storage</a>? Corsair thinks they do, and it’s showing off a new line of USB4-powered portable SSDs at CES.</p>



<p>The new EX400U series is much more simple and streamlined than previous Corsair designs, looking kind of like a tiny tin of mints, or maybe less charitably a shrunken-down Mac Mini. That design language might be a bit intentional…because these drives are MagSafe compatible. They’ll stick to the back of your iPhone. The case is a hair over 64mm wide (just a bit wider than a Magsafe charger) and 12mm thick. </p>

<p>Unveiled this week at CES in Las Vegas, the Altas Wireless Security System includes two 2K bullet-style Altas cameras, two 6-watt solar panels, and a Home Hub for centralized management.

<p>CES is kind of huge this year. We’ve got big new announcements from almost every major PC company, including new GPUs from both Nvidia and (to an admittedly lesser extent) AMD. And their OEM partners are showing off their stuff on the floor, too. MSI has Nvidia cards, Gigabyte has both of them, and Adam Patrick Murray got to check them all out. </p>



<p>First up we’ve got MSI’s incoming lineup of RTX 50 series cards, including the Gaming Trio, Vanguard, and Suprim variants. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. </p>

<p>Road warriors don’t believe in a laptop that’s too light. Such principles are why we have designs like the ThinkPad X1 Nano, the LG Gram, and, of course, Apple’s Macbook Air series. Asus’ Zenbook designs has done sleek and light for a long time, but the new Zenbook A14 is stepping things up with an incredible mix of longevity and light weight. </p>



<p>I’ll start with a potential deal-breaker: The Zenbook A14 uses a Snapdragon X processor. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2388952/new-ai-windows-for-copilot-pcs-what-it-can-do.html">That means Windows on Arm</a>, which might be a turn-off for a lot of users. But if you’re okay with the newfangled platform that debuted last year, you already know how this goes — users sacrifice gaming performance and deal with a few compatibility issues, in exchange for incredible battery life and (at least in some

<p>We were wowed by laptops in 2024 with two-day battery lives. Now, Asus has gone one better, unveiling the Qualcomm-powered Zenbook A14, which boasts a 32-hour battery life – that’s almost three days of glorious runtime.</p>



<p>The Zenbook A14 is the highlight of Asus’s new 2025 Zenbook lineup, which it unveiled at CES 2025 this week, not just because of its insane battery life but also because it weighs just 2.5 pounds.</p>



<p>Asus claims that makes it the world’s lightest Copilot+ PC – and there’s no doubt that it pushes the boundaries of what a portable AI-capable laptop can be.

<p>Asus has fronted CES 2025 in Las Vegas with a strong lineup of Vivobook laptops, once again making its presence known in the lightweight and portable laptop category for creators, gamers, and casual users.</p>



<p>The lineup includes refreshed models featuring new Qualcomm, AMD, and Intel processors that put AI power as well as power efficiency on display. Power efficiency being a strong presence in these laptops’ chips, they’re likely to propel battery runtimes to the forefront of our PCWorld laptop performance stats in 2025.</p>

<p>AOSU has announced the HomeCortex, a new smart home security hub set to debut at CES 2025.

It also breaks from the subscription-based model by providing up to 16TB of local storage, making it a compelling choice for homeowners looking for robust, long-term security without the extra costs.</p>



<p>The HomeCortex addresses the growing demand for unified smart home security solutions, where a single system can manage multiple cameras and related devices. As more households adopt connected technology, centralized control has become essential, streamlining what can often be a fragmented setup. With local storage options ranging from 32GB to 16TB, the HomeCortex also eliminates the recurring costs of cloud subscriptions, allow

<p>Over the last few years, it feels like gaming laptops have grown up a bit. They’ve become a bit broader in their appeal, a little less “futuristic jukebox” and a little more “boardroom bling.” But MSI just said nuts to all that and plastered their newest gaming laptop in dragons, presumably while blasting a Def Leppard album. Somewhere out there, Seto Kaiba is nodding in stoic approval.</p>



<p>The MSI Titan 18 HX Dragon Edition Norse Myth is a gaming laptop with a “hand-drawn” dragon motif on the lid, plus an inlaid “3D dragon and dragon ring” in the palm rest. MSI says that these artistic touches have a “metallic sheen, refined texture, and a flawless vintage-inspired finish.” </p>



<p>Okay, granted, this is all a bit ridiculous and over the top. But if you’re interested in a gaming laptop that truly goes all out, the Dragon Edition might just tickle

<p>This is the best price we’ve ever seen for this portable SSD, which is a pretty darn good reason to jump on this while you can. It has a respectable 1TB capacity, more than enough to house all your photos, videos, games, and more. Need even more space?

But don’t worry! Lenovo has stepped in with its IdeaCentre Mini x — a tiny, cool, Snapdragon X-equipped desktop.</p>



<p>At CES 2025, Lenovo showed off the SFF desktop, priced at $659.99 and expected to ship in April. Incidentally, that’s a substantial discount from Qualcomm’s $900 Dev Kit that was discontinued in October 2024.</p>

<p>For more than three decades, the TrackPoint’s iconic red rubbery nub has been a staple of IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. But now, no longer. Lenovo has removed its famous TrackPoint from its latest ThinkPad laptops, calling it time for a change.</p>



<p>Does that mean the TrackPoint is dead? No, thankfully. It will still appear in the other ThinkPads made by Lenovo, said a company spokesman. But for the 14- and 15-inch ThinkPad X9 Aura Editions launched at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, the TrackPoint has been removed entirely.</p>



<p>The idea is that certain laptops — let’s say the Dell XPS — have managed to transcend the consumer, prosumer, and small business markets, and the TrackPoint is a legacy design, according to Lenovo. “That doesn’t resonate with all demographics, so to speak,” said the company’s spokesman. “That was cutting-edge technology at one

The Yoga family includes 2-in-1s or convertibles, generally emphasizing form-factor flexibility as much as anything else. It’s here you’ll find laptops like the new Yoga Book 9i, which flips over to provide a convertible that can be used as a presentation display or for inking. </p>



<p>Though it might not be the most practical, the standout model is the updated Lenovo Yoga Book 9i, with an improved processor as well as larger screens. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955290/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-review.html">We liked the 2023 Yoga Book 9i</a>, even if its performanc

<p>That’s this thing’s full title, by the way: “Lenovo Legion Go S Powered by SteamOS.” It’s a mouthful because the “S” indicates a refined and simplified design versus <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2229777/why-lenovos-legion-go-isnt-my-go-to-handheld.html">the original Legion Go</a>, which had a lot of Nintendo Switch DNA in its hardware. The new Legion Go S will also be available in a more conventional Windows-powered flavor, whi

<p>Lenovo’s rollable laptop debuted as a concept several years ago. Now, it’s real and ready for prime time. Dubbed the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, this futuristic laptop with an unrolling, expandable screen will ship in the first quarter of 2025.</p>



<p>Priced at about $3,500, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 parallels Lenovo’s existing <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1955290/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-review.html">Yoga Book 9i</a>, which debuted in 2023 with a pair of screens sandwiched together. But the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable puts one screen behind the other with the rear one able to extend out, so instead of forcing one screen to replace the keyboard, the Rollable preserves Lenovo’s keyboard design. It’s a solid compromise on both fronts.</p>



<p>While in its compact mode, the Rollable offers a fairly standard 120Hz 400-nit OLED display with 100

<p>These days, a mini PC can deliver fantastic performance at a fraction of the cost of a full-blown desktop PC or laptop. The Beelink SER5 Pro mini PC is a great example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-Computer-Graphics-Support-Three-Screen/dp/B0CF1Y4Z8T/">now on sale for $271 on Amazon</a>, which is a cool 25 percent off its original $359 price tag.</p>



<p>This tiny computer features an AMD Ryzen 7 5850U processor, a model that’s been out for a few years at this point but can still handle light gaming and everyday work apps with no issue. There’s also 16GB of RAM on board, which you can later upgrade to 64GB as needed.</p>



<p>The Beelink SER5 Pro also comes with a 500GB SSD, which should be enough storage for most folks, including all your apps, photos, documents, and some videos. Still, if it’s not enough, you can always upgrade up to 2TB of

<p>The Steam Deck is a great device, but it ain’t exactly a powerhouse. And with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2569484/surprise-nvidias-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-cost-less-than-you-thought.html">new graphics cards</a> coming into the market from every angle, plus new AAA games that almost demand them, the Steam Deck’s aging integrated setup isn’t looking any hotter.</p>



<p>Enter GeForce Now, Nvidia’s PC game streaming service, which is slated to hit the Steam Deck and enable the remote playing of games.</p>



<p>The beta for this app has been available for <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2321512/geforce-now-gets-easier-to-launch-on-steam-deck.html">over half a year</a>, a modified browser shortcut that uses the Linux version of Chrome.

<p>Why didn’t AMD talk about their upcoming GPUs in their CES 2025 keynote? Or their new Z-series processors for handheld PCs? What is the Ryzen AI Max? And when can I actually buy a Ryzen 9000X3D chip?</p>



<p>AMD executives only had 45 minutes for their CES 2025 keynote. Fortunately, they also tacked on an additional half-hour or so to field burning questions from a small handful of chip journalists, who crowded around David McAfee, AMD’s corporate vice president and general manager of its Client Channel Business, and Frank Azor, the chief architect of gaming solutions and gaming marketing at AMD.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence continues to prove its worth as Razer just demonstrated at CES 2025 this week, announcing a Razer AI gaming coach called Project AVA.</p>



<p>Yes, it seems that apart from morphing badly drawn stick figures into portraits worthy of Picasso and giving you someone kind to chat to when your cat runs away, AI bots can also make you a better gamer, or even an esports superstar – you better believe it!</p>



<p>Razer has dubbed Project AVA the “ultimate AI gaming copilot, promising to deliver real-time insights from esports coaches.” But it’s not the first AI gaming coach we’ve encountered. Gamers may already be familiar with the likes of SenpAI that uses AI to analyze and coach player performance in games like <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em>.</p>

<p>Two displays? Three displays? When you need a true laptop workstation, you go with five displays — and Plugable’s UD-7400PD, powered by the DisplayLink DL-7400 chipset, does just that.</p>



<p>As the name indicates, this isn’t a Thunderbolt dock. Instead, Plugable’s new dock uses the DisplayLink protocol, essentially compressing and splitting the signal across several ports. In this dock’s case, Plugable says that works out to four 4K displays plus one 8K display.</p>



<p>Plugable chief executive Bernie Thompson said the new dock is aiming for corporations trying to lure their employees back to work, offering them something they don’t have at home. While you could use one mammoth display, Plugable showed off a configuration using several small portable displays, combined and aligned together in a mosaic of monitors.</p>

<p>The smart home mavens at SwitchBot are showing several new products at CES 2025, including an innovative video doorbell that comes bundled with a dedicated 4.3-inch display. They’ve also taken the wraps off a versatile retrofit smart lock that will work on just about any type of entry lock.</p>



<p>It’s that display that really sets the SwitchBot Video Doorbell apart from the competition. Mount it to your kitchen wall or set it on your countertop, and you’ll never need to worry about reaching for your smart phone with wet or soiled hands because you’re in the middle of preparing a meal. Just take a glance at the monitor to see who’s at the door.</p>



<p>Should you want to speak to your visitor, you can take advantage of the system’s two-way audio. This is also a great solution for younger—or older—members of the family who don’t <em>have </em>a smartph

<p>With 8,000 GPH suction power and dual brush technology, the Z1 Pro promises thorough cleaning, removing debris from floors, walls, and waterlines.</p>
