(GUC), the Advanced ASIC Leader, announced today that it has successfully taped out Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express\u2122 (UCIe\u2122) PHY IP with 40Gbps per lane on TSMC\u2019s N5 process, beyond UCIe\u2019s highest speed, for AI/HPC/xPU/Networking applications. UCIe 40G chiplet interface provides industry leading bandwidth density 1,645 GB/s per mm of die edge. The IP supports any speed up to 40Gbps and uses Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) to reduce supply voltage achieving 2x better power efficiency for required speed. The chip is assembled using TSMC\u2019s CoWoS\u00ae (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) advanced packaging technology.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com/guc-taped-out-ucie-40gbps-ip-using-adaptive-voltage-scaling-avs/\">GUC Taped Out UCIe 40Gbps IP using Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS)\u00a0</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com\">EE Times</a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Dr. Zhou Zhenyu pointed out that AI applications, from edge AI to generative AI, have different requirements for computing power. Many edge AI applications are specialized and do not demand large models or substantial computing power. This is particularly true in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) fields such as speech interaction, audio processing, predictive maintenance, and health monitoring. Therefore, edge AI is crucial for widespread AI adoption, and integrating AI into battery-powered, low-energy IoT devices is key to making edge AI a reality.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com/edge-artificial-intelligence-ai-game-changer-actions-technology-is-redefining-the-future-of-audio-chips/\">Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) Game Changer: Actions Technology Is Redefining the Future of Audio Chips</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com\">EE Times</a>.</p>",
