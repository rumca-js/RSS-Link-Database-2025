<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Reviving a discussion from 9yr ago in this thread that didn’t ultimately achieve the goal. I’m looking to compile a list of sound effects that are as recognizable (if not as well-titled) as the Wilhelm Scream.</p> <p>I’m talking this sound of a metal door opening that’s used all the time, regardless of door - <a href="https://youtu.be/gcLrmmLcKDA?si=htJSdxy3rlz1sF7s">https://youtu.be/gcLrmmLcKDA?si=htJSdxy3rlz1sF7s</a></p> <p>I’m talking that sound of a group of children laughing that gets used all the time. </p> <p>I’m talkin the red-tailed hawk sound that gets used for all sortsa birds.</p> <p>Help me out, I’m doing a friend’s night presentation on classic sounds that, once you clock them, will have you pointing at the TV just like you do for Wilhelm. </p> <p><em>LINKS APPRECIATED IF POSSIBLE</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zebesneezer"> /u/Zebesneezer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www

## The 'Remember the New Villain?' trope in later sequels just makes them feel underwhelming.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Trope:</strong> A previously unmentioned or unseen villain, who’s somehow deeply connected to the main character(s) and fully caught up on all the franchise’s plot points, is suddenly introduced in the 4th, 5th, 6th, or whatever sequel they’re on now. What were they doing all this time? Just hanging out off-screen or something?</p> <p>For instance, <em>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning</em> introduces Gabriel and gives him some real bad history with Ethan that predates even the first <em>Mission: Impossible.</em> For someone with this bad of blood with Ethan, it took 7 movies to show up.</p> <p>So, when you run out of new bad guys to introduce, just come up with a name and give them some grudge that goes back to before the first movie in the franchise.</p> <p>What do you think about this trope? Other examples come to mind?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/artpayne"> /u/artpayne </a> <br

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is an amazing film and my second rewatch, what i don’t understand is how anyone can come to the conclusion that the story is about Father Flynn’s actions and that the ending was about his guilt?! The entire film is a beautiful culmination to the very final words delivered by Meryl Streep ‘I have doubts’. She is so clearly talking about her faith, from the very first scene introducing us to this journey, when Father Flynn’s sermon talks about a crisis of faith - to the final scene showing the sister clutching her cross as she delivers those words. Meryl Streep again and again talks of her CERTAINTY about Flynns guilt, that certainty is vital to her entire character and motivations. She even says ‘but i have my certainty’ and then later on ‘his resignation was his confession’ - you can argue the film doesn’t make it super clear wether Father Flynn is guilty, its no accident the words ‘but did you prove it’ are repeated, no solid proof just as ther

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>These two films are not necessarily great films, Supergirl is more of a campy bad movie, but Helen Slater is the best thing about these two movies. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever get another Supergirl as Helen Slater. Slater didn&#39;t just look like Supergirl, she was strong and likable. You rooted for her, evenm if she had some woeful lines. </p> <p>And in &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot;, the teen feminist film about a teen girl who becomes an inspiration for the youth after she and her brother accidentally shoot the sleazy dad of a bully who tried to rape her and they run from the cops. When Slater cuts her hair in honor of Joan of Arc, you can see why she&#39;d have people follow her. </p> <p>I still think she should have had better offers. She was pretty popular for a few years, with movies like Ruthless People, City Slickers and The Secret of My Success making bank, but I don&#39;t think she ever got that big breakout part in a hit movi

Big budget 90&#39;s Hollywood production values, no effects, nothing fancy, just a really well made movie.</p> <p>I&#39;ve lived in a tiny town of 800 people for the last decade too, so it probably hits different for me now. I remember really liking this when I was a teen growing up in the city. Re-watching now and it&#39;s changed / I&#39;ve changed, but movie still stands up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/uncre8tv"> /u/uncre8tv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hvez5c/leap_of_faith_1992_is_criminally_slept_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hvez5c/leap_of_faith_1992_is_criminally_slept_on/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I live in Southern California and have noticed that some LA showings have it projected at standard 70mm in contrast to Irvine Spectrum which has it displayed in IMAX. Which showing should I pick to ensure that I get the best viewing experience for this movie?</p> <p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/xehzn8.png">This is what shows on Fandango for me. 70mm and IMAX.</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whostheme"> /u/whostheme </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hve6hh/the_brutalist_in_imax_vs_standard_70mm_california/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hve6hh/the_brutalist_in_imax_vs_standard_70mm_california/">[comments]</a></span>
