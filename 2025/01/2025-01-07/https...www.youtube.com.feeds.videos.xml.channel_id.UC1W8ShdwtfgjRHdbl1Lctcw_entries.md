I colorized, restored, and created a custom sound design for this video of 1930s Italy, showcasing a journey through Rome, Venice, and Florence. The video highlights stunning architecture, such as the grand cathedrals and historic piazzas, the iconic canals of Venice, bustling markets, and landmarks rich with history. It also includes glimpses of political posters for Il Duce, capturing the atmosphere of the era

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
