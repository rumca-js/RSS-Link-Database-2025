I hate the forced updates, I hate the constant adding of bloat, I hate the way they keep removing options. I also, truly, hate the idea of windows 11. But Linux is its own can of problems and solutions. There are a few that I am still unsure as to how I would solve, in order of importance.</p> <p>1: Discord Screen-sharing. I do this on a *daily* basis. My group of friends and I are always playing new games, and streaming them to one another, as well as anime and movies. From what I can tell, the two big issues with it on Linux, is entirely discord&#39;s fault, but, seems to be that it cannot correctly grab the audio of an application, and that there is some sort of delay. These are both deal-breakers for me, as I screenshare and watch screenshares DAILY. Is there a third-party client that fixes this perhaps? Or has this been
