<p>The irony will surely not be lost on Mikel Arteta. On a night when his side were hoping to put one foot in the Carabao Cup final, it was Alexander Isak – a striker that the Arsenal manager has long coveted – who did the damage as Newcastle secured a famous victory.</p><p>It was no less than Eddie Howe’s side deserved as they bid to reach the final once again after the heartache of losing to Manchester United at Wembley in 2023. Goals either side of half-time from Isak – his 10th in his last nine appearances – and Anthony Gordon ensured they will go into next month’s second leg at St James’ Park with a healthy advantage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/07/arsenal-newcastle-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The Tory leader’s reality is largely shaped by what she reads on social media, so unless she’s taken time out to help the Muskster find a drug counsellor, she’s decided that she’d be better off keeping quiet for a while.

<p>The Meta boss’s decision to get rid of the platform’s 40,000 moderators has set the stage for a fact-free four years online</p><p>Social media have always acted as something of a funhouse mirror to society as a whole. The algorithms and amplifications of an always-online existence have helped accentuate the worst parts of our lives, while tucking in and hiding the best. It’s part of why we’re so polarised today, with two tribes shouting past one another on social media into a gaping chasm of hopelessness.</p><p>Which is what makes a declaration by one titan of big tech this week so worrying.

In their pre-season predictions, the famously prescient Guardian football writer brains trust had them finishing 19th before a ball was kicked. Their struggles in the previous season had them rightly among the relegation favourites before they promptly romped home first past the post by an astonishing 10 points. Indeed, so surprising was their title win that even the handful of eccentrics who were prepared to admit to wagering actual money on them being crowned champions ended up bottling it and hedging their bets early doors, while the BBC’s woke snowflake-in-chief Gary Lineker was forced to renege

The broad appeal was because of writer-director David Lynch and writer-producer Mark Frost’s compelling style, which transformed a small-town murder mystery into an oddball drama, replete with profound tragedy, supernatural forces and complex relationships.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/

<p>Resolutions are undeniably terrible when we make them for ourselves. But what about if we began making them for each other?</p><p>What’s the right age to realise new year’s resolutions are trash that won’t last until February? By about 12 years old, the data should be in: nothing is in any better order than it was this time last year and you’re a damn fool to think this year will be any different. Now give yourself a couple of decades’ leeway while you work other things out, such as who you are, and then you’ll realise that January is a time to relax and concentrate on keeping warm rather than making lists. This is something I should have learned many moons ago.</p><p>But January’s pull is irresistible. David Bowie is my earworm, crooning “ch-ch-ch-changes”, quietly, but not quietly enough. One tiny yet significant improvement must be manageable, surely? Yes, is 2025’s answer, but with a difference: I have decided that this is the year you should make resolutions for your friends.

Even away from home in deepest midwinter, with sub-zero temperatures freezing your snot, it is only fully visible to those aware of just how deep certain individuals have already had to dig to be there.</p><p>So yes, size clearly matters to some extent. Vision, too, in a game that grows ever quicker. Athleticism, power and pace, obviously. Tactical nous, regardless of position. Above all else, though, is something that goes beyond mere routine commitment. Call it resilience, character, stubbornness, competitiveness or virtual insanity, it is particularly evident in adversity. Some people have it by the bucket-load, others less so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/

<p>Famous for her work with Oprah Winfrey, Martha Beck is a bestselling author and self-help superstar. But for 60 years she was anxious and terrified - until she found a simple, uplifting answer</p><p>All her life, Martha Beck had been anxious, but a few years ago she began to get really curious about anxiety. And curiosity, she wants us all to know, may just be the path out of paralysing, life-spoiling terror. During the pandemic, Beck – a bestselling author and life coach – started looking deeper into anxiety in order to help her clients. It was something she thought she knew about, having experienced it throughout her life, and over the years she had followed the standard advice: she had practised meditation for 30 years, and been on medication, but now Beck was starting to wonder if inner peace was as far as it went.</p><p>Instead of trying to control her anxiety, Beck started to befriend it: “I started treating myself like a frightened animal and doing for myself what we all in

<p>New films from Paul Thomas Anderson and Kelly Reichardt with stars including George Clooney, Michaela Coel and Cate Blanchett will premiere this year</p><p>Jim Jarmusch prefers to work at an unhurried pace, but perhaps it’s no coincidence that his longest inter-picture hiatus has followed the most tepidly reviewed release of his career. Soon, it will have been six years since his low-key zombie comedy The Dead Don’t Die was met with a resounding shrug at Cannes, and it would seem that the coolest cucumber in American independent cinema will respond by paring down to basics. No more fun and games with genre, just a “very subtle”, “very quiet”, “funny”, and “sad” family affair gathering Cate Blanchett, Charlotte Rampling, Adam Driver, Tom Waits and a pink-haired Vicky Krieps around the dinner table. But if it’s going to be anything like his last film dealing with parents and children – the hangdog, allegorical Broken Flowers – then we can still expect the rhyming repetitions, eclect

<p>An almighty twist and a demented finale rescue the Shaun of the Dead actor’s cartoonish homage to folk horrors – but co-star Aisling Bea deserves better</p><p>The trouble with Nick Frost’s knowingly cartoonish and silly comedy paying homage to folk horrors such as The Wicker Man and Midsommar is that Frost has done this kind of movie before, and better. His hugely enjoyable collaborations with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, Shaun of the Dead and The World’s End, had a perfect command of comedy horror. The tone here feels less good natured, more self-congratulatory, the comedy not quite so light on its feet. Though it comes into its own with a cheerfully gruesome gorefest in the last half-hour.</p><p>Frost writes and stars alongside Aisling Bea (who really does deserve a better horror film).

<p>Zendaya appeared on the Golden Globes red carpet wearing a diamond the size of a Quality Street chocolate. Cue internet hysteria</p><p>What is it about Tom Holland and Zendaya? No really, please tell me. Both of these perfectly good actors seem like perfectly nice and interesting people – and yet for some reason, they attract an intense level of scrutiny that would be more understandably directed at things like insurance policies and war crimes.</p><p>On Sunday, when Zendaya appeared on the Golden Globes red carpet wearing a diamond <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/its-just-not-right-consumers-decry-changes-to-quality-street-chocolates">the size of a Quality Street</a> chocolate, all bets were off: she and Holland had to be engaged. Internet sleuths started sleuthing and, within minutes, had determined that the ring she wore was not from Bulgari, whose jewellery Zendaya is contractually obliged to wear as one of their brand ambassadors.</p> <a href="https:

<p>Li Jianxiong was a highflying marketing executive in Beijing until a breakdown sent him to the west on a wellness voyage of discovery – just as his peers were losing faith in the Chinese Dream</p><p>Li Jianxiong is convinced he has lived two lives. His first began in 1984, when he was born to impoverished farmers in China’s Henan province. Ambitious and daring, he took full advantage of the new economic reality that unfolded after the cataclysms of the Mao years. By 2017, he had secured a family, a house in Beijing and a reputation as one of China’s most talented young marketing men. His success, however, came at a cost. By then, China had become notorious for its “996” work culture – 9am to 9pm, six days a week – but Li was working something closer to 007: 24 hours a day, every day. While managing an all-consuming media crisis for his employer, a major tutoring company, he developed insomnia, heart palpitations and a severe rash that doctors attributed to a flagging immune system

<p>While her family roast their own turkeys, bitter Emma calls a halt to festivities, what with her son being banged up. Then Joy’s mystery daughter arrives, fresh from a … cult?</p><p>The wheel of fortune has turned. This Christmas, the Aldridges – finally on an even keel after Alice was exonerated from involvement in the fateful car crash on the Am – spent a day of familial bliss dining on Scandinavian themed treats, like so many Norse gods in a Wagner opera, under the elegant awning of one of Kate’s yurts. The Grundy/Carters, by contrast, are in a state of schism, broadly along the lines of who was willing to grass George Grundy up to the police and who wasn’t. Various festive lunch combinations were mooted in a bid to circumnavigate the great Eddie Grundy/Susan Carter rift (Susan having definitively broken the code of the Grundys when she insisted the police handle the crimes of her grandson). The Grundy festive table was all about turkey, of course, since they raise the birds; t

<p>Body-horror movie The Substance has finally given Moore the acclaim she has worked for – after 45 years of being recognised for anything but her acting</p><p>Maybe she was just acting, but Demi Moore seemed genuinely surprised to win a Golden Globe on Sunday night. “I’m just in shock right now,” she gasped. “I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first time I’ve won anything as an actor.”</p><p>It’s an odd thing to hear from a woman who has been one of the most famous actors on the planet for much of that 45 years. It reflects the fact that Moore has often been recognised for everything <em>except</em> her acting: her beauty, body, dress sense, salary, box office and love life. All of which makes her rehabilitation and recognition truly satisfying. In her acceptance speech, she spoke of having been branded a “popcorn actress” by a producer 30 years ago – commercially successful but unworthy of acclaim. No wonder she closed her speech celebrating the
