<p>Baseus has announced the launch of its S2 solar-powered security camera, which features solar tracking technology, advanced motion detection, and a wire-free design.</p>



<p>The S2 ($149) builds on the foundation laid by the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2506157/baseus-s1-pro-security-camera-review.html">Baseus S1 Pro</a>, which introduced features like a rotating solar panel and advanced AI motion detection. While the S1 Pro boasted 3K resolution and a dual-lens system with optical zoom, the S2 takes clarity a step further with Ultra 4K resolution, delivering sharper visuals for more detailed monitoring.</p>



<p>At the heart of the S2 is its sun-powered tracking system, which rotates the solar panel 40 degrees left and right to maximize sunlight exposure. This feature complements the S1 Pro’s solar panel, which could tilt and rotate more dy

<p>In a recent <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/01/06/ces-2025-the-year-of-the-windows-11-pc-refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, Microsoft declared 2025 to be the “year of the Windows 11 PC refresh.” That’s because when October rolls around, official support for Windows 10 is going to end and most users will likely need to switch over to Windows 11 when that happens.</p>



<p>However, if you’re planning on waiting until the last minute to make that switch, you might want to think again. According to one security expert, the security risks for all non-upgraded PCs will only continue to get worse between now and then.</p>

## Razer made a Steam Deck dock, and it’s surprisingly affordable

<p>When I think of Razer, I think of two things: RGB lighting, and expensive. But surprisingly only one of those applies to the Handheld Dock Chroma, a USB-C dock designed for the Steam Deck and similar PC-based handheld gaming gadgets. The 6-in-1 dock-slash-stand should work with any of them, and do so for $79.99 USD. </p>



<p>That’s not cheap, certainly — it’s more expensive than any number of third-party Steam Deck dock/stand accessories on Amazon. But it’s the same price as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock">Valve’s official Steam Deck Docking Station</a>. Razer’s take on the form factor also has a fold-down top that turns it into a sleek little black box when not in use. That makes it a bit more portable, and it’s a nice aesthetic addition.</p>

## Razer’s Project Arielle gaming chair warms and cools your butt year-round

<p>It’s not enough to just expect your gaming chair to keep you cool during hot summer days anymore. No, it should <em>also</em> keep you warm when your bones start frosting over in the winter.</p>



<p>If that sounds like a pipe dream, it’s not. Razer’s Project Arielle, announced at CES 2025 in Las Vegas this week, is one such chair, capable of turning down the heat on your backside or warming your buns up when they get a little icy. That description is probably a bit tongue in cheek, but Project Arielle is a serious piece of gaming hardware.</p>



<p>It’s based on the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-chairs/razer-fujin-pro/RZ38-04940100-R3U1">Razer Fujin Pro</a>, one of Razer’s most comfortable thermally engineered gaming chairs.

<p>If there’s one component in PCs that hasn’t really changed much over the past couple of decades, it’s memory. While newer memory generations have offered faster speeds and greater capacity support, there have been few new features or evolutions of the standard that make a difference all by themselves. But that all changed in 2024 with the emergence of CUDIMMs—so different from traditional memory, these modules deserved their own acronym.</p>



<p>These Clocked Unbuffered Dual Inline Memory Modules, as opposed to the more traditional UDIMMs, introduce a new clock driver chip, hence the added “C” in the name. This boosts the signal from the CPU’s onboard memory controller, enhancing its integrity, and bolstering system stability and potentially performance, too. It’s a true next-generation memory standard that will make its way into most high-performance PC

## 2025 might be the best time to buy a PCIe 5 SSD

<p>The long-standing advice for PC storage for gamers, workers, and everyone in between has always been, “Just use an SSD.” It didn’t matter too much if you were using a PCIe 3 SSD, a PCIe 4 SSD, or even an older SATA SSD. The on-paper performance advances in the top drives just didn’t deliver the kind of real-world advantages that would make it worth recommending them every time.</p>



<p>But that may be starting to change with a whole new generation of NVMe 2.0 SSDs, which are faster, leaner, and more capable than ever before.</p>



<p>This is an important distinction, too, because while PCIe 5 SSDs have been around for a while, they haven’t yet garnered the interest they deserve, because frankly the value proposition they made wasn’t that impressive. As we move into 2025, however, the latest generation of SSDs from Biwin and other manufacturers could be

<p>If you’re working with high-resolution video like 4K or 8K, then there is one guarantee to your work: You’re going to produce a monstrous quantity of data. That in turn often means working with many inadequate memory cards. They’re not big enough to store all your data, and certainly not fast enough to get it off the card in a timely manner. But that’s just the price you pay for dealing with UHD video, right?</p>



<p>Not necessarily. A new generation of memory cards using the PCIe 4 protocol is set to increase  memory card performance by 10-fold, ushering in a new era of high-performance, portable storage cards that will finally make dealing with 4K and 8K more viable. The <a href="https://www.biwintech.com/product/amber-cb500-cfexpress-4-0-type-b-memory-card/">Biwin Amber CB500 CFexpress 4.0 Type B</a> delivers unmatched speed and durability for demandi

<p>For years, it’s been more important to have <em>enough</em> memory, than <em>fast enough</em> memory, but that’s all starting to change. While you still need to make sure you have plenty of RAM for the games you want to play and the apps you want to run, faster DDR5 memory kits will absolutely improve your system’s performance, whatever you’re doing. New DDR5 kits are introducing exciting new features and performance potential for anyone looking to boost PC performance in 2025.</p>



<p>With AMD’s latest Ryzen 9000 CPUs and Intel’s new Core Ultra Arrow Lake processors, everyone’s finally using DDR5 memory and the official supported speeds are higher than ever. In classic fashion, though, memory makers like Biwin are really pushing the boundaries and unlocking even more performance on the fringes.</p>

<p>Set for release next month, the AquaSense 2 Ultra arrives with Beatbot’s HybridSense AI Pool Mapping system, which integrates AI cameras, infrared sensors, and ultrasonic technology to create precise, efficient cleaning paths, ideal for tackling every inch of the pool.</p>



<p>The Ultra’s cleaning capability covers floors, walls, waterlines, and even the water surface. The unit also includes the ClearWater Clarification System, which uses natural crab-shell agents to bind fine particles, allowing the bot to clean up to 99,000 gallons of water four times faster than traditional clarifiers.</p>

<p>It’s official: Nvidia’s next generation of gaming graphics is here, and friends, the GeForce RTX 50-series looks pretty compellingly priced on paper. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced not just one, not two, but <em>eight </em>different GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards powered by a new “Blackwell” GPU architecture during his CES 2025 keynote – four for desktop, and four for laptops, all compatible with a new DLSS 4 generation.</p>



<p>The same GPUs were announced for both form factors: The GeForce RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070. It was a big difference from AMD’s keynote, where <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568373/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-rdna-4-embrace-the-ai-revolution.html">RDNA 4 and the Radeon RX 9070</a> weren’t even mentioned despite press receiving a high-level briefing.</p>
