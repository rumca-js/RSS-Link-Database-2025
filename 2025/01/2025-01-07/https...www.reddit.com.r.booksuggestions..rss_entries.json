Just as the title says i&#39;m looking for books where the character lives in a house that has multiple or infinite rooms that the character/characters enter through and they land in a different world with different time periods ( fantasy, medieval, etc. ) and they go on adventures and meet people, make friends, fall in love, etc. It&#39;d be nice if it was a whole series with each book centering on the characters spending in a single world. Bonus points if there is some Arab/Middle Eastern mythology but that&#39;s not a hard requiremtn. But i want it to be super atmospheric and immersive.

He is going to be starting chemo soon and I wanted to get him some books to read during it. So many horror novels deal with the horrors of real life too and I obviously can&#39;t screen all the books for mentions of cancer. I&#39;m hoping that I could get some suggestions for some really good horror novels that won&#39;t bring up cancer. To help a bit, he really enjoyed &quot;Tender is the Flesh&quot; and would probably like &quot;The Hellbound Heart&quot; (is there cancer in that?). </p> <p>Thanks for any suggestions you&#39;re willing to give!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lainbrainbutt\"> /u/Lainbrainbutt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hvx118/horror_novel_that_doesnt_have_anything_to_do_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp",

I do enjoy both taking care of my child and I enjoy the work I do for the most part, but I&#39;m feeling very blah and I&#39;m looking for a book to help me find ways to feel less blah or give me suggestions on altering my mindset, or... I don&#39;t know, something lol. </p> <p>Even just a nice, feel good book to read that isn&#39;t corn city, even if it&#39;s fiction.

I mostly read sci-fi / fantasy or comics but I want something more romance focused because I\u2019m sad and lonely but need something fresh. Forgive me if this post uses to much terminally online fandom language - I don\u2019t read a lot of romance so I only have the character dynamics that happen in other series to help describe what I\u2019m seeking. Stuff I like:</p> <p>Jane Austen - pride and prejudice</p> <p>The Han Solo/Princess Leia dynamic - I find that outside of Star Wars OT and Rogue/Gambit in X-men this is rarely well executed. </p> <p>Batman in many ways is the ideal male mc for me. But I do not necessarily like the bat/cat dynamic. </p> <p>Lord of the rings -Aragorn The witcher- geralt/yen The expanse series - James Holden If you\u2019re familiar with video games: I love Garrus Vakarian from mass effect.
