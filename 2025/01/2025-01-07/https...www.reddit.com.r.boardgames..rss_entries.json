I know you probably have heard of the <strong>30 questions to fall in love</strong>, i like some of those questions but i wanted something that looked a little nicer than just a list of questions so i turned it into a simple game with many more questions. It has 4 categories including new people, friends, family and romantic partners. Each category has 3 levels with 10 questions each and it is meant to spark meaningful conversations which i think is <strong>great when meeting new people/ dating</strong>.</p> <p>This my first programming project that i built from scratch so if you have any feedback it would be highly appreciated. Also if you have any feedback with the questions let me know to.</p> <p>Here is the link to the app, cant wait for you to use it and <strong>start bonding with people you care about</strong> :)</p> <p><a href=\"https://card2bond.co",

The Danish version has an extra rule that doesn&#39;t exist in English: uncommon compound words are forbidden.</p> <p>So, the Germanic languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, German and Dutch) have a feature where you can make up compound words on the spot. Compound words also exist in English, they are basically just words that are two words smushed together (footpath, horseshit, headache, etc.), but they are much much more common in Germanic languages. Lots of multi-word nouns in English (duct tape, girl scout, movie night, etc.) are single words in the germanic languages. But it is also possible to at any point take two words and combine them to create a new word. Like if you wanted to talk about a bird&#39;s anus, you would say &quot;fugleanus&quot; in one word.

Recently I watched a video about complexity and depth, and the concepts made perfect sense for me. But in my experience, I feel that the more complex a game is, the less room there is for actual strategy. I understand that more complexity creates more room for decision-making, but unless there is a very good mechanics, its likely that there is a single winning strategy. In the end, its mostly about calculations. The fact that a beginner cannot compete with an experienced player does not necessarily means that the game is deep. Sometimes the rules are just so complex that it becomes a skill to simply understand the ground where you are stepping foot on. The beginner loses because he hasn&#39;t tested everything that there is, because he doesn&#39;t remember the most weird rules about the game. </p> <p>Of course this is just a general meditation.
