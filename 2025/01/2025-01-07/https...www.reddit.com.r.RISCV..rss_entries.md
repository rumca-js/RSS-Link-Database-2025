<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just got the following email from Arace:</p> <hr/> <p>Dear Customer,</p> <p>Sorry for the late shipping.</p> <p>The shipment of Milk-V Megrez will be delayed, and I estimate that it will be shipped before Spring Festivak, 2025.</p> <p>Our supplier Milk-V has identified a signal quality issue with the interface of the Milk-V Megrez model. They have corrected the PCB and rescheduled production to ensure that customers receive products without any signal quality problems.</p> <p>We are committed to providing you with the best products. Thank you once again for your support. If you are in a hurry, you can apply for a refund and wait for the available stock. </p> <p>Thank you for your understanding in advance.</p> <hr/> <p>&quot;Spring Festival&quot;, aka Chinese New Year, starts on January 29.</p> <p>They had been promising to ship within 30 days of ordering, and orders opened on November 25.</p> <p>Of course it is better to have a working product :-)
