We use geometry every day: cutting paper to wrap a present, calculating the area of a room to tile a floor, and interpreting pie charts and bar graphs at work. Even noticing when a picture on the wall is askew draws on our geometrical understanding.

In quantum computers, information is often carried by single photons and picked up by structures named superconducting nanostrip single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). In principle, traditional type-I superconductors would be easier to integrate into existing quantum computing architectures than the type-II materials more widely used today. So far, however, this possibility hasn't been widely explored.

As fruits and vegetables are perishable, it can be challenging to keep them fresh and safe to eat. In the time it takes to transport them from farm to table, these difficulties with post-harvest storage mean that enormous amounts of fresh produce are currently being wasted. While this waste can be reduced with the help of cold storage and robust packaging, these solutions are often highly unsustainable. They involve non-biodegradable plastics, or harmful chemicals which can leach into food and soil damaging the environment and even our own health.

Neural implants contain integrated circuits (ICs) -- commonly called chips -- built on silicon. These implants need to be small and flexible to mimic circumstances inside the human body. However, the environment within the body is corrosive, which raises concerns about the durability of implantable silicon ICs. A team of researchers address this challenge by studying the degradation mechanisms of silicon ICs in the body and by coating them with soft PDMS elastomers to form body-fluid barriers that offer long-term protection to implantable chips. These findings not only enhance the longevity of implantable ICs but also significantly broaden their applications in the biomedical field.

Knowing who may progress along the disease pathway is critical for early diagnosis and intervention, improved treatment and better disease management, according to a team that has developed a new method to predict the progression of autoimmune disease among those with preclinical symptoms. The team used artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze data from electronic health records and large genetic studies of people with autoimmune disease to come up with a risk prediction score. When compared to existing models, this methodology was between 25% and 1,000% more accurate in determining whose symptoms would move to advanced disease.
