## I was the first to own an Amiga 500 in the small town where I lived. A few years ago, my computer gave up the ghost, but this Christmas, I got some of that magic back (The Music Studio was my very first floppy disk).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hola.</p> <p>Fixing up an Amiga 500+. Brand new to Amigas (having concentrated on Spectrums before) but going great so far and got it up and running. </p> <p>Not knowing much about Amigas, I was wondering what memory expansion options I have for the Plus model. Are they different to the standard 500? Is there a difference between RAM and Fast RAM?</p> <p>Any other mods I should be looking for? Got a Gotek and a drive switch (to boot off Gotek and not internal floppy) installed already. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ed-2-Zero-9"> /u/Ed-2-Zero-9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hvvh17/amiga_500_extended_memory_options/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1hvvh17/amiga_500_extended_memory_options/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hej, -- <em>please read the entire thing, this is very specific -- A1200 recapped, new Sony Disk Drive, culprits are all a bunch of old 2DD disks -- A1200 reads and writes disks 100% perfectly with &quot;quiet Disks&quot;, i use Xcopy and Diropus, long time experienced user.</em></p> <p>I have noticed that some 3,5&quot; disks while rotating make more or less mechanical noise. While the head moves inward and outwards during formatting i notice an increasing soft <strong>rhythmic grinding sound that corresponds with read write errors</strong>. I am pretty sure, this corelates with <strong>warped magnetic medium</strong>.<br/> - Is this a known problem? (..that 3.5&quot; disks warp inside the plastic case if not used for long time?)<br/> - Are these disks that have been stored in the same position for a long time warped so that the distance to the read write head fluctuates, and therefore the disk becomes unusable?<br/> - Is there any know method excep
