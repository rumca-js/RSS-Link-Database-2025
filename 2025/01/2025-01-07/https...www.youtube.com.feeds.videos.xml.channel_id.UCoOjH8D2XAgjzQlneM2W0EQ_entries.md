With Trump in charge, these next 10-12 months will be the easiest time in recent history to make money and build your wealth.
And with 9-5 jobs being replaced by gig workers and cheap workers overseas,
With the Great Melt-Up right around the corner after Trump leaves office as the government debt keeps hockeysticking, 

These next 10-12 months might be your last chance to escape the Middle Class with relative ease, by making as much money as you can, and pouring that money into assets before everything gets more expensive from inflation.
But how?
Well, to make an extraordinary amount of money in a very short amount of time, is gonna require some extraordinary thinking. 
If you think like a worker like they conditioned you in school, it will lead you to take the same actions as a worker, which will then make you get the same outcome as a worker
Which is why this Part II, is so so
