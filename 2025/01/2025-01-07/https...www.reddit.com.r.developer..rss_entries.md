<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi devs,<br/> After over a decade as a developer in a big company, I often find myself reflecting on the constant change, the buzz, the AI hype, and the lack of focus on creating a great developer environment. Instead, it feels like many managers and leaders are more concerned with profits and bonuses. It makes me wonderâ€”could it be time for an international developer strike?</p> <p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, this might not resonate with everyone, but after reading numerous DevRel, DevEx, and developer reports/surveys, Iâ€™ve noticed a significant number of devs and engineers feeling frustrated with their work environments. And letâ€™s not even start on the layoffs, often justified by some grand idea of cutting devs in favor of GenAI or other agents to boost profits and lower development costs.</p> <p>Iâ€™m just curious and trying to reflect. Whatâ€™s your take on this? What have your experiences been? Is it time for a developer strike to capture attention.</p> </d
