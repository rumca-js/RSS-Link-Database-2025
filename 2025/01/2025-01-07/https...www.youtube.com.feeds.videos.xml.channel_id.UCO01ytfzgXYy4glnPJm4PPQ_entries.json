        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, our hallowed \u201cpublic health authorities\u201d and the Biden Administration are setting the stage for Prohibition 2.0 with a push to put cancer warning labels on alcohol. They claim that alcohol in any amount causes cancer. But is that actually true? We\u2019ll discuss. Also, Justin Trudeau steps down. Mark Zuckerberg claims that his platforms will once again embrace free speech and open expression\u2014but should we trust him? And, a black NFL coach gets fired. Is it because he\u2019s bad at his job, or is it racism? We\u2019ll try to get to the bottom of that.\n\nEp.1509\n\n- - -\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch the full show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos every day. https://www.youtube.com/c/MattWalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\n- - -\n\nDailyWire+:\n\nKick off 2025 with 25% off your new DailyWire+ annual membership.
