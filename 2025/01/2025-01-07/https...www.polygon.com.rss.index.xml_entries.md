<p class="has-text-align-none">Few games have accurately captured the experience of online brain overload like <em><a href="https://neal.fun/stimulation-clicker/">Stimulation Clicker</a></em>, a new free browser game by Neal Agarwal (creator of <em>Infinite Craft</em>, <em>The Password Game</em>, and <a href="https://neal.fun/">more</a>). This is a clicker game in the style of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg">Banana</a></em> or <em>Universal Paperclips</em>, but it’s also a parody of clicker games and the whole concept of clicking as a dopamine release.</p>
