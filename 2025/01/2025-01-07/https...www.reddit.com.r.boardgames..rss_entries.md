<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Hello everyone!</strong></p> <p>I wanted to share an app/website i made a few weeks ago. I know you probably have heard of the <strong>30 questions to fall in love</strong>, i like some of those questions but i wanted something that looked a little nicer than just a list of questions so i turned it into a simple game with many more questions. It has 4 categories including new people, friends, family and romantic partners. Each category has 3 levels with 10 questions each and it is meant to spark meaningful conversations which i think is <strong>great when meeting new people/ dating</strong>.</p> <p>This my first programming project that i built from scratch so if you have any feedback it would be highly appreciated. Also if you have any feedback with the questions let me know to.</p> <p>Here is the link to the app, cant wait for you to use it and <strong>start bonding with people you care about</strong> :)</p> <p><a href="https://card2bond.co

## Are word games in your native language easier or harder than in English? Do they require additional rules?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;m from Denmark, and I just got the Danish version of Just One, and upon reading the rules I realized something that made me extremely curious. The Danish version has an extra rule that doesn&#39;t exist in English: uncommon compound words are forbidden.</p> <p>So, the Germanic languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, German and Dutch) have a feature where you can make up compound words on the spot. Compound words also exist in English, they are basically just words that are two words smushed together (footpath, horseshit, headache, etc.), but they are much much more common in Germanic languages. Lots of multi-word nouns in English (duct tape, girl scout, movie night, etc.) are single words in the germanic languages. But it is also possible to at any point take two words and combine them to create a new word. Like if you wanted to talk about a bird&#39;s anus, you would say &quot;fugleanus&quot; in one word. Most of these compound words

My question is whether it’s one of those games that you need to play multiple times to understand, or if it’s something I’ll either love or hate from the first playthrough (regardless of the fact that it obviously takes experience to master it). In the case of Oath, I had to pass on it because it’s clear that enjoying it requires multiple sessions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSandman84"> /u/TheSandman84 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hw0t6y/question_about_arcs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1hw0t6y/question_about_arcs/">[comments]</a></spa

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I really like boardgames but I have never been into the community. Recently I watched a video about complexity and depth, and the concepts made perfect sense for me. But in my experience, I feel that the more complex a game is, the less room there is for actual strategy. I understand that more complexity creates more room for decision-making, but unless there is a very good mechanics, its likely that there is a single winning strategy. In the end, its mostly about calculations. The fact that a beginner cannot compete with an experienced player does not necessarily means that the game is deep. Sometimes the rules are just so complex that it becomes a skill to simply understand the ground where you are stepping foot on. The beginner loses because he hasn&#39;t tested everything that there is, because he doesn&#39;t remember the most weird rules about the game. </p> <p>Of course this is just a general meditation. I understand that a game with mor

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My group and I love TI4, but..</p> <p>It just feels like an &quot;older&quot; game, specifically in the sense that a lot of the design decisions feel like they were made to iterate on or add to previous versions. It really giclves the impression that if the creators were to start from scratch and remake the game, it would be significantly cleaner. Not to mention, the war mechanics are so insanely fleshed out for an aspect of the game that the game itself actively seems to discourage and punish.</p> <p>Ultimately, the game feels like it could be so much more polished and clear.

With my wife we like Res Arcana, TTR Amsterdam, Jaipur, Patchwork.</p> <p>What doesn’t work: Tiny Towns and Bonhanza, they lack substance and drama.</p> <p>Now I was seriously thinking of buying TTR Europe because then we can play with 5 ppl and it has a nice board presence, but I said myself it has similar mechanics to the other games and it will bore me after some time.</p> <p>So now I’m thinking to try Catan although I never played it. The reason is that I want to try new mechanics and in particular negotiation, something that gives us memorable moments. Bohnanza has trading but it’s only cards so it’s not visually appealing, and we played it twice and just doesn’t have drama.</p> <p>Any thoughts on Catan or anything similar? Anyone in a similar position of mine? I’m aware of the usual reviews and it’s
