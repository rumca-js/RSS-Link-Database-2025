<p>Yaccarino and and X owner Elon Musk have both championed the crowd-sourced fact-checking feature that Meta now plans to emulate on its own services. “I think it’s really exciting when you think about community notes being good for the world … and it couldn’t be more validating than to see that Mark and

<p>According to Wikipedia, the first instance of the phrase “post-truth” was written by Steve Teisch in 1992 when referencing political scandals post-Watergate. Clearly, ol’ Stevie never visited CES, where the standards for saying things that are provably true are slightly laxer than in the rest of civil discourse. Apropos of nothing, a company called Rictor, which makes and sells one e-bike, the Rictor K1, is advertising the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://rictor.com/products/skyrider-x1">Skyrider X1.</a> A <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-06-184-delivery-drone-for-people.html">moped-cum-quadcopter</a> that you can use to zoom through the streets one second, and through the skies another.

<p>At a surprisingly star-studded event this morning, BMW showed off the final form of its long-awaited and long-teased Panoramic iDrive system. It&#39;s a combination of an oddly angular touchscreen, a windshield-spanning heads-up display, and an LLM-powered AI assistant. The big news? It&#39;s coming to every future BMW.</p>

It comes from ASUS and it’s the new Zenbook A14, a system that the company had joked about calling the Zenbook Air.</p>
<p>To be fair, the name would have been fitting: the notebook weighs less than 2.2 pounds (or 1kg), a half a pound lighter than Apple&#39;s most svelte MacBook Air. In almost every respect, the ZenBook A14 outclasses Apple&#39;s ultraportable, with specs like a 14-inch OLED screen and up to 32 hours of battery life. The only catch is that it runs on Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon X and X Elite chips, which limits compatibility with older Windows apps (along with some devices).</p>

<p>I lived in New York City for many years and absolutely loved it, with one major caveat. Packages got stolen, like a lot. This was especially frustrating for a tech reporter waiting on review gadgets and the like. Hyve Security is looking to solve this problem with its self-named smart lockbox, which it brought to CES 2025 in Las Vegas.</p> 
<p>The Hyve is being advertised as “the first branded smart lockbox” and can be secured to the front of a house or apartment via a quarter-inch carbon fiber tether. Carbon fiber is notoriously difficult to cut, so that’s one security measure.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>The lockbox also ships with an accelerometer and a “shrieking” alarm that will go off if the device is moved or tampered with. The box’s owner will receive an alert in this instance. Neighbors, friends and family will also receive alerts if they opt-in to the community service. The Hyve app will integrate with many current smart home security systems for even m

These experimental features were available for preview at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. The company intends to start testing them with users this month.</p>
<p>A Peacock spokesperson told <em>TechCrunch </em>that during the testing period, some users will see the games and shorts, while others only see one or the other. The remainder won’t be able to play games or watch shorts.</p>

<p>A little more than two years ago, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-shows-off-a-rollable-smartphone-and-laptop-090518096.html">Lenovo teased a concept laptop</a> with a rollable screen that could expand and contract with the touch of a button. And now at CES 2025, the company has turned that idea into a reality with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Lenovo’s new device looks incredibly similar to what the company showed off in the past. The laptop features a flexible 14-inch OLED display that can unfurl itself to become a 16.7-inch panel at the push of a button. This effectively adds an extra 50 percent of screen space to the system without the need for any additional accessories or peripherals. Alternatively, you can use gestures to expand and contract the display for a truly touch-free experience. Though in my experience, that took so much longer you might as well use the dedicated key. Thankfully, brightness is more than suffi

The original 1996 <em>Diablo</em> <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/07/xbox-game-pass-january-2025-wave-1/"><ins>hits PC Game Pass on January 14</ins></a>, so those of us who have been living under a rock since Bill Clinton’s first term can finally see what all of the fuss is about.</p>
<p>What can I say about <em>Diablo</em> that hasn’t been said already? It’s the OG action-RPG that basically defined the genre. It’s a legitimate classic. There’s a reason why the franchise is still going strong deep into the 21st century. The battles are intense, the progression is satisfying and the character customization options are just as deep now as they were in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The water block’s official name is the Mag Coreliquid A13 concept, though the name is mute because MSI says it has no plans to turn it into an actual retail device available for purchase. That’s a bummer because, not only does that prevent you from putting a cute spinning table inside your desktop, but also the cooler that the A13 is based on — the Mag Coreliquid A15 360 — is a real product that has some neat specs.

<p>Maingear is one of the original boutique PC makers that popularized water-cooled rigs more than 20 years ago. However, after focusing more on air-cooled systems over the past few years, at CES 2025 the company is returning to its roots with two stunningly-crafted machines in the Apex Force and Apex Rush.</p>
<p>Based on Phanteks’ NV9 case, the Apex Force is the unquestionable flagship in Maingear’s new 2025 lineup. It weighs upwards of 50 pounds and has pre-bent hardline tubes that have been angled 10 degrees to match the distinctive sloped design of its enclosure. It boasts not one but two separate cooling loops for its CPU and GPU with massive dual 420mm radiators, three 140mm fans plus another 65mm intake on the bottom to push all that hot air out.</p>

<div id="c0b115090cda4874a13a1b38c3c16239"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oFkXHAmFns" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>Lenovo may not admit it outright, but the goal with these new models is to entice younger buyers who might not have a ton of nostalgia for the company’s 30-year-old laptop line. That said, the X9 line (which will be available in both 14- and 15-inch variants) still delivers the same military-grade durability (MIL-SPEC 810H) you’d expect from a typical ThinkPad while boasting an even sleeker and more minimalist appearance.</p>

<p>Lenovo has a new series of updated Legion gaming laptops at <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2025/">CES 2025</a>. The star of the show is the 10th-generation Legion Pro 7i. It supports up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, thanks to its cooling system that enables up to 250W thermal design power (TDP). It also has an AI engine that dynamically adjusts CPU and GPU wattage for optimal performance.</p>
<p>The 2025 Legion Pro 7i supports up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor and the aforementioned RTX 5090 on the graphics side. Lenovo’s <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-gaming-laptops-ces-2023-ai-chip-160033869.html">Legion Coldfront Vapor</a> cooling helps it support that high-end hardware. Tack on up to 64GB of 6400Mhz DDR5 (2 X 32GB) RAM and the built-in LA1+LA3 AI chip, and you’re looking at a souped-up machine for on-the-go gaming (and just about anything else you could throw at it).</p>

It’s big and beefy and comes with extra equipment like detachable controllers, a kickstand and vertical mouse functionality that lets it adapt to all sorts of situations. Unfortunately, those features made it kind of bulky too, so at CES 2025, Lenovo is announcing a slightly more portable version called the Legion Go S with support for not one but two different OSes.</p>

This powered exoskeleton is intended to help people complete jobs that require heavy lifting or advanced movement.</p>
<p>To that end, it offers dynamic lifting support of up to 80 pounds. This means that it can lift the entire thing or help a bit when people need it, sort of like how rider assist works with electric bikes. The company says “it makes physically demanding tasks feel effortless” and that lifting 70 pounds will feel like nine or ten pounds for the lower back.</p>

<p>Razer brought a fancypants monitor stand to CES 2025 in Las Vegas, and this one features RGB lights. The Chroma stand is an ergonomic unit built from anodized aluminum, with a sleek black matte finish. It can support up to 44 pounds, which should easily accommodate most monitors.</p> 
<p>The integrated RGB lighting supports up to 16.8 million colors and can run a series of lighting effects. Users create custom lighting profiles which can be cycled through via a remappable button. This button can also be used for other purposes, like launching applications or muting audio. Of course, it syncs up with <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/razers-latest-gaming-gear-includes-rgb-lights-and-new-huntsman-pro-keyboards-182303396.html"><ins>other Chroma-capable devices</ins></a> to “create a cohesive, immersive aesthetic.” Yay, lighting!</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Netgear just announced a new Wi-Fi 7 mesh router system called the Orbi 870, joining the pre-existing 970 and 770. The company says that the latest system “offers the perfect balance of performance, coverage, and security.”</p> 
<p>To that end, the Orbi 870 offers tri-band speeds up to 21Gbps and all kinds of modern bells and whistles. These include enhancements like support for the latest 320MHz bandwidth and 4K QAM, which squeezes more data into traditional transmissions. This looks to be a fairly future-proof router system.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>Netgear also touts the reliability of this device, thanks to an enhanced backhaul that combines 5GHz and 6GHz into a single band. Of course, there are plenty of wired connectivity options here. There’s a 10 gigabit internet port and four 2.5Gbps Ethernet ports on the router. Additionally, each satellite includes four Ethernet ports.</p>

<p>The Pinwheel Watch doesn’t scream “this is a kids’ device.” The new smartwatch, unveiled at Pepcom during CES 2025, doesn’t have a chunky, brightly colored casing or super-thick bezels. It’s actually pretty sleek, with a build like a slightly larger Apple Watch — plus a little camera bump — and swappable straps of different styles. To tech-aware kids who have begun bugging their parents for a smartwatch just like they have, it would easily pass as an analogue for an adult wearable. But it’s also packed with safety features meant to offer only the amount of connectedness that parents feel comfortable with. And an AI chatbot, because, of course.</p> 
<p>Pinwheel already has a smartphone platform that allows for parent-approved communications, but the watch is a standalone 4G LTE cellular device with its own mobile plan (about $15 according to the company) and the ability to make calls, send texts and, down the line, do video chats. Parents can determine the level of intervention the

<p>However, (the clue is in the name) the Blaze 11 has a huge 11-inch 2,560 x 1,600 IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits of brightness. The effect of that huge screen is akin to “holding a steering wheel with a tablet-sized screen slammed in the middle,” according to our own Sam Rutherford.

<p>In a sea of smartphone gaming controllers with chunky grips, obtrusive analog sticks and rigid backplates, the MCON by Ohsnap stands out. It’s a gamepad that essentially turns any phone into a supercharged Xperia Play, complete with Hall effect joysticks, silent buttons and handles that can extend out of its base. It also has bumper-style triggers and actual bumpers. When it’s attached to the back of a phone, the MCON creates a slightly chunky but uniform profile that slides into a pocket without fuss. When you’re ready to start playing, the phone pops up from the gamepad with a satisfying flick.</p> 
<p>The MCON communicates with your smartphone via Bluetooth, no cables or plugging in required. It uses MagSafe to connect to iPhones, and for Androids, there will be a MagSafe adapter included in the box — this is simply a disc 2 millimeters thick that sticks to the back of your phone or case. That covers essentially every smartphone out there, and it’s possible to stack multiple co

<p>The G1 is a pair of smart glasses that either come in a Philip Johnson-esque round body or, if you opt for the new G1B, in a more rectangular frame. Both are equipped with a 160mAh battery the company promises will last for around one and a half days on a single charge. Inside are a pair of waveguide displays with a 25-degree field of view and a resolution of 640 x 200 displaying basic text and graphics in old-school green. The glass

Standing up and taking breaks is the best way to combat the ill effects of desk life, but if you’re looking for ways to make technology conform to you instead of the other way around, an ergonomic mouse can help. Instead of contorting your wrist and hand to fit a standard mouse, ergo mice have a vertical or semi-vertical orientation that feels more natural. Trackball mice minimize travel and could reduce strain on your upper arms. I’ve been searching for a mouse that would help with my shoulder tension so I tried about 20 highly rated options to find the best ergonomic mouse — these are the best of what I tested.</p>

<p>One of the things I love the most about CES is finding all the silly one-offs and concept products that might never see full production. At CES 2025, MSI made something truly joyful when it created a custom CPU cooler that features a built-in turntable.</p>
<p>The water block’s official name is the Mag Coreliquid A13 concept, though a name doesn’t really matter because MSI says it doesn’t have plans to turn it into an actual retail device. That’s kind of a bummer since not only does it mean you won’t be able to put a fun little spinning table inside your desktop, it also sucks because the cooler that the A13 is based on — the Mag Coreliquid A15 360 — is a real product that has some neat specs. It features an offset CPU mount that can improve the performance of recent Intel chips (like the Core Ultra 200S) that have hotspots in unusual positions.</p>

<p>In this bonus episode, Cherlynn and Devindra discuss the latest innovations in robot vacuums, new AI PC hardware from AMD and Intel, and Dell's decision to nuke its PC brands in favor of Apple-esque "Dell Pro" and "Dell Pro Max" branding. (Note: We recorded this episode before NVIDIA announced its new RTX 5000 GPUs, but we'll have more to say on that soon!)</p>

<p>CES 2025 has begun, which means a whole fleet of new gadgets has been unleashed onto the world. As usual, team Engadget has battled jet lag, sleep deprivation and the static shocks of those horrible casino carpets to bring you all the news that’s fit to print.</p>

<p>NVIDIA has introduced DLSS 4, the latest version of its real-time image upscaling technology, at CES 2025. It is coming to all RTX GPUs, including the RTX 20 series that was discontinued back in 2020, but the older models aren&#39;t getting all its features. In the new GeForce RTX 50 series models, DLSS 4 will enable Multi Frame Generation. The feature generates up to three additional frames for every traditionally rendered one and can help multiply frame rates by up to eight times more than traditional brute-force rendering. NVIDIA says the improvements brought by Multiple Frame Generation on the GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, its new $1,999 flagship GPU <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidias-rtx-5090-graphics-card-costs-2000-031133416.html">arriving this month</a>, will enable 4K 240 FPS fully ray-traced gaming.</p>

## The Swippit Hub keeps your iPhone loaded up with fresh batteries

<p>There&#39;s so much AI-powered nonsense at CES that it&#39;s kind of refreshing to see a very straightforward, classic gadget like the Swippitt. It&#39;s a breadbox-sized hub that contains five battery packs that can fit into a a custom-made iPhone case. When the battery is in the case, it works like similar product, keeping your phone juiced up. The trick is that when the battery is empty, you pop your phone into the top of the box and it automatically removes the battery from the case and drops in a fresh one.</p>
<p>Keeping our phones charged up is definitely a problem, but it&#39;s fair to ask whether Swippitt is an over-engineered (or possibly too expensive) solution. For $450 you get the Swippitt hub and five batteries, but you&#39;ll also need to purchase a separate $120 case for your iPhone. The team is making cases for the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series and is also working on ones for Samsung as well. If you&#39;re intending this to be a family solution for multiple phones,

<p>At CES 2025, MSI is launching a huge lineup of upgraded laptops with various specs that cater to an array of budgets. But of everything, one system stood out and if you take even a quick look at it, I think you can see why.</p>
<p>As part of MSI’s Titan Series, not only is the Titan 18 HX the biggest and most powerful system the company makes. However, the special Dragon Edition features a ton of unique design traits that ensure it will never get lost in a crowd. On its lid is a hand-drawn close-up of a scaled monster (no AI art here) which was then acid-etched into the aluminum resulting in an incredibly detailed and textured surface. You&#39;re literally staring into the eye of the beast.</p>

<p>While parent company Dell is doing a big rebrand of its entire PC portfolio, at CES 2025 Alienware is sort of returning to its roots by bringing back the classic Area-51 name back for its new flagship laptop line.</p>
<p>Available in 16- and 18-inch versions, the resurrected Area-51 gaming notebooks feature what Alienware is calling a brand-new industrial design. Though if you look closely, you can see some similarities to existing systems like the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-x-14-review-a-portable-gaming-laptop-that-doesnt-suck-143013640-143013160.html"><ins>x14</ins></a> and <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-x16-m16-m18-gaming-laptops-170032351.html"><ins>x16</ins></a>. Both models sport a striking anodized liquid teal paint job with an almost iridescent quality.

<p>HP only has one all-new laptop in its Omen gaming line to show off at CES 2025, but it looks like a doozy because the company claims it’s the most powerful 16-inch notebook it has ever made.</p>
<p>The Omen Max 16 looks like HP took a standard Omen 16 (which is retaining the same design but getting refreshed with new components for 2025) and then crammed in as many high-end components as it could. This includes support for CPUs from both Intel and AMD with up to a Core Ultra 9 275HX or Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 along with a range of NVIDIA RTX 5000-series GPUs.</p>

The company announced the new model at <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2025/">CES 2025</a>, describing the resurrected Area-51 as “retaking the throne” as Alienware’s latest flagship gaming PC. But royalty doesn’t come cheap, as its launch configuration will cost around $4,500. (Cue spit take.)</p>
<p>The new Area-51 PC has a full-sized 80L tower with headroom for over 600W of dedicated graphics power and 280W for processing. It supports the latest NVIDIA graphics cards and an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPU.</p>

<p>Acer just announced a trio of new Predator gaming laptops at CES 2025 that are packed with high-end specs. They arrive with different price points and feature sets, but all of them include NVIDIA RTX-50 series GPUs.</p> 
<p>The baddest of the bunch is the Predator Helios 18 AI. As indicated by the name, this laptop features an impressive 18-inch 4K Mini LED display. The refresh rate can typically go up to 120Hz, but a new dual-mode display feature lets users switch to FHD resolution at 240Hz. The brightness metrics are decent, at up to 1000 nits.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>

<p>Alienware has just announced the Alienware 27 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor at CES 2025. According to the company, the monitor has the highest pixel density for an OLED or QD-OLED (more on this in a minute) monitor at 166 pixels per inch (PPI). But that’s not all it offers.</p>
<p>The monitor has Dolby Vision HDR and VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification for even better image quality. The 0.03ms response time is perfect for competitive gamers who value extreme speed, and the 240Hz refresh rate is nothing to sneeze at either. Finally, it comes with an AI algorithm (because in 2025, of course it does) that&#39;s supposed to protect against burn-in.</p>

<p>On the same day NVIDIA briefly became the most valuable company in the world, CEO Jensen Huang took to the CES 2025 stage to announce the company&#39;s new, long-awaited Blackwell family of graphic cards. The first salvo of RTX 50 series GPU will arrive in January, with pricing starting at $549 for the RTX 5070 and topping out at an eye-watering $1,999 for the flagship RTX 5090. Laptop variants of the desktop GPUs will follow in March, with pricing there starting at $1,299 for 5070-equipped PCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NVIDIA kicked off the Blackwell portion of its CES presentation with a demo of a next-generation Assassin&#39;s Creed game featuring the most realistic ray-traced graphics the series has ever featured. &quot;All of this, with AI, is the house that GeForce built,&quot; said Huang, wearing a new snakeskin jacket instead of his signature leather jacket. &quot;Now, AI is coming home to GeForce.&quot;</p>

<p>The appropriately named Rave 3S is described as an “AI party speaker” with 200W output and 108dB volume. Anker says it can fill spaces of up to 1,076 square feet. Like some other Soundcore models, its RGB LEDs can create a light show that syncs with the beat of your music.</p>

Case in point, the company is introducing the Anker Solix Solar Beach Umbrella at CES 2025, a flexible, freestanding shade structure that can also charge your phone or power the company&#39;s EverFrost 2 cooler.</p>
<p>Like a normal umbrella, the Solix Solar Beach Umbrella is portable, collapsible, and designed to protect you from rain (Anker&#39;s umbrella is specifically IP67 rated). What makes this solar beach umbrella unique from what you might have laying around in your garage are the flexible solar panels it has attached on top.</p>

<p>Anker has a major presence at CES 2025, as the company has revealed a whole bunch of wild and wacky products. One such item is a newly-announced solar electric cooler, which is basically like a portable refrigerator/freezer combo.</p> 
<p>The Anker Solix EverFrost cooler is available in three sizes, from 23L to 58L, and uses air-cooled refrigeration technology for “faster and precise cooling.” To that end, Anker promises that these units cool more than 20 percent faster than rival products and allow for accurate temperature regulation from -4 degrees to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>
<p>That’s right. The temperature range is vast enough to refrigerate and freeze items. The largest model even has two independent compartments to do both at once. That’s pretty handy. There could be one side for beverages and another side for those all-important ice cubes.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of high-tech bells and whistles here. As stated before, this is a sola

<p>Anker announced a new wall charger at CES 2025 and this 140W model includes a nifty display for keeping track of various metrics. These data points include power usage per port, temperature and whether or not fast charging has been activated. The company has been popping displays on its larger chargers for a while now, but this is the first screen we’ve seen on something this small.</p>
<p>The screen even displays something Anker is calling an odometer, which measures lifetime usage in hours. The diminutive charger boasts a surprising number of ports, which is always useful. All told, there are three USB-C ports and a single USB-A port. The design also makes it less prone to falling and loosening when plugged in.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Anker 3C1A supports multiple fast-charging options, including PD3.1 and UFCS, making it compatible with a wide range of devices. Could this be the mythical <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/computin
