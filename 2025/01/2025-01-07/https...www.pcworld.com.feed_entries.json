While you still need to make sure you have plenty of RAM for the games you want to play and the apps you want to run, faster DDR5 memory kits will absolutely improve your system\u2019s performance, whatever you\u2019re doing. New DDR5 kits are introducing exciting new features and performance potential for anyone looking to boost PC performance in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen 9000 CPUs and Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra Arrow Lake processors, everyone\u2019s finally using DDR5 memory and the official supported speeds are higher than ever. In classic fashion, though, memory makers like Biwin are really pushing the boundaries and unlocking even more performance on the fringes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the combination of new memory technolog",
