Researchers have created a simulation that maps underground water on a continental scale. The result of three years' work studying groundwater from coast to coast, the findings plot the unseen path that each raindrop or melted snowflake takes before reemerging in freshwater streams, following water from land surface to depths far below and back up again, emerging up to 100 miles away, after spending from 10 to 100,000 years underground.

A study has found cardiovascular conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, which are known to contribute to brain blood vessel damage in younger populations, not to be associated with an increased risk of such harm in individuals 90 and older.

## Earth's air war: Explaining the delayed rise of plants, animals on land

If you like the smell of spring roses, the sounds of summer birdsong, and the colors of fall foliage, you have the stabilization of the ozone layer to thank for it. Located in the stratosphere, where it shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, the ozone layer plays a key role in preserving the planet's biodiversity. And now we may have a better idea of why that took so long -- more than 2 billion years -- to happen. According to a new study, Earth's early atmosphere hosted a 'battle royale' between iodine and oxygen -- effectively delaying the creation of a stable ozone layer that would shield complex life from much of the sun's ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The new theory may solve a mystery that has puzzled scientists for hundreds of years.

## Smart food drying techniques with AI enhance product quality and efficiency

Food drying is a common process for preserving many types of food, including fruits and meat; however, drying can alter the food's quality and nutritional value. In recent years, researchers have developed precision techniques that use optical sensors and AI to facilitate more efficient drying. A new study discusses three emerging smart drying techniques, providing practical information for the food industry.

## Pluto-Charon formation scenario mimics Earth-Moon system

A researcher has used advanced models that indicate that the formation of Pluto and Charon may parallel that of the Earth-Moon system. Both systems include a moon that is a large fraction of the size of the main body, unlike other moons in the solar system. The scenario also could support Pluto's active geology and possible subsurface ocean, despite its location at the frozen edge of the solar system.

Researchers have developed an innovative method for rapidly creating laser light sources in large quantities using an inkjet printer that ejects laser-emitting droplets. By applying an electric field to these droplets, the researchers demonstrated that switching the emission of light on and off is possible. Furthermore, they successfully created a compact laser display by arranging these droplets on a circuit board.

## Reducing irrigation for livestock feed crops is needed to save Great Salt Lake, study argues

The Great Salt Lake has lost more than 15 billion cubic yards of water over the past three decades, is getting shallower at the rate of 4 inches a year, and an analysis of its water budget suggests reducing irrigation is necessary for saving it.

Engineers created a smaller, faster and more efficient photonic switch, which leverages principles from quantum mechanics and could accelerate everything from streaming to training AI by supercharging data centers.

## Method can detect harmful salts forming in nuclear waste melters

A new way to identify salts in nuclear waste melters could help improve clean-up technology, including at the Hanford Site, one of the largest, most complex nuclear waste clean-up sites in the world. Researchers used two detectors to find thin layers of sulfate, chloride and fluoride salts during vitrification, a nuclear waste storage process that involves converting the waste into glass. The formation of salts can be problematic for waste processing and storage.
