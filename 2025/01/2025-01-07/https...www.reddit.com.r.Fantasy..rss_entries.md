<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’m 64% way in the first book, and I know I’ve just started the series but I’m wondering, does Mercy get stronger? She’s pretty weak (but determined) right now, which is fine but I would hope that she doesn’t stay like this. </p> <p>I might have had the wrong expectations because I just finished Kate Daniels and Kate is a such a strong swordsman and a capable fighter so I assumed this series would be the same way. </p> <p>I’m getting the feeling that this series may be more “romantic”…or not really focused around on the protagonist’s strength but her relationship with people and I do hope I’m wrong </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional_Long_7996"> /u/Additional_Long_7996 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hw4wyy/mercy_thompson_series_does_mercy_get_stronger/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hw4wyy/mercy_t

I find that I naturally jump between the two, but if I have to pick one to stick to, I&#39;m most comfortable with writing in the first person. </p> <p>In my book each chapter is going to focus on a different person&#39;s story, however I am still wondering if it should be from a 1st or 3rd person point of view. I have tried writing the same chapter from different perspectives and I find 3rd person more difficult and less emotional, immersive, and engaging whereas I find 1st person easier, immersive, and more engaging and emotional.</p> <p>My book is in the fantasy genre. If you had to pair it with other book series, I would compare it to The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, The Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski, The Game of Thrones Series by George R.R.

But you don&#39;t read a volume 5 of a series that&#39;s 500k words long, longer than the entire LoTR trilogy, because you hate Sanderson, his writing and everything it stands for. On the contrary; I was enchanted by Way of Kings when i read it more than a decade ago. </p> <p>The journey of Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, Adolin and co have been a warm presence in my life for the past 14 years, and even though Rhythm of War made it clear that this series was really no longer for me; I felt like these characters deserved to get closure - or maybe even re-ignite the flame that brought me here 15 years ago. </p> <p>However Wind of Truth was a disappointment.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I firmly believe that Al-powered fantasy games are set to revolutionize the entire fantasy genre. In traditional games, sto-ries, characters, and worlds are static-everything is pre-written and follows fixed paths. But what if the story could change every time you play? What if the world truly reacted to your choices? This is where Al-based games come in. Imagine being in a fantasy setting where the Al analyzes your actions and generates a completely unique narrative in real time.</p> <p>You could interact with characters that have dynamic, evolving personalities rather than pre-scripted dialogue options. You could explore worlds that are shaped by your decisions and encounter moral dilemmas that arise purely from your own actions.</p> <p>Platforms like Al Dungeon have already demonstrated the potential of this concept. It allows you to write your own story while the Al takes it in surprising and unexpected directions. Then there&#39;s Nonhuman.dev,

Brandon Sanderson&#39;s work often came highly recommended to me and I was excited to read them, but today I&#39;m feeling kinda... whelmed.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We elves, dwarves, orcs and even dragons quite often. Fae are pretty often as well, though they have a lot of variance. What races would you like to see featured more.</p> <p>Personally I&#39;m always looking for kitsune, especially as the MC or as a main character. Sirens, harpies, and phoenixes are definitely up there as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Phoenixfang55"> /u/Phoenixfang55 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hvgjnm/what_fantasy_races_would_you_like_to_see_featured/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hvgjnm/what_fantasy_races_would_you_like_to_see_featured/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just recently discovered (and have been devouring) T Kingfisher&#39;s works. I read Nettle and Bone and the Wizard&#39;s Guide to Defensive Baking. I started the Saint of Steel series before knowing there were other previous books set in the same world. I&#39;ve already read the first two, but starting Paladin&#39;s Hope I&#39;m seeing lots and lots of references to the clocktaur war and Wonder Engines. My question is, do I need to read that duology (and maybe Swordheart) before Paladin&#39;s Hope or will I be okay to continue on and then read them after? I was planning on waiting until Swordheart came out in its newly published form in February to read it if possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emperius317"> /u/emperius317 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hvgfj6/t_kingfisher_world_of_the_white_rat_reading_order/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i have been a huge reader for years and have had my fair share of romantasy reads but i&#39;m at a point where i&#39;ve outgrown books like ACOTAR and fourth wing, but i&#39;m really struggling to find genuine fantasy books and series that people speak highly of. every time i find a video of &quot;rating fantasy books! fantasy books i read this year!&quot; it always winds up being romantasy books titled &quot;a court so viscous and lustful&quot; and the like. i do enjoy brandon sanderson and plan on picking up The Way of Kings when my local BAM restocks, and i have a copy of The Mists of Avalon but i&#39;m not familiar with Arthurian legend and put it down a couple pages in because i was intimidated, and that&#39;s the most i&#39;ve heard of in the realm of fantasy books... i&#39;m really just looking for well-written characters, thoughtful world-building, magical stories where romance isn&#39;t the end-goal. any recs are appreciated! </p> </div><!--

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for some fantasy to read with a darker female protag. Thinking along the lines of Harrow from The Locked Tomb series - somewhere between misunderstood or just outright evil, haha. The sort of villain you can&#39;t help but root for.
