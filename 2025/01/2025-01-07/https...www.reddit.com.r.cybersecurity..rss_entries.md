<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Reddit community,</p> <p>I‚Äôm currently conducting research on developing a solution aimed at addressing the <strong>visibility gap between IT and OT environments</strong>. By visibility I mean the ability to gain comprehensive, real-time insight into the activities, events, and security posture of both IT and OT environments. With the increasing convergence of IT and OT systems, the lack of integration and understanding between these domains has become a major challenge for organisations, particularly in critical industries like manufacturing, energy, and transportation. Visibility across IT and OT ensures a <strong>holistic view of security</strong> across the entire organization, reducing blind spots, improving collaboration, and enhancing overall resilience to cyber threats.</p> <p>I‚Äôd love to hear from professionals on both sides‚Äîthose in <strong>IT security</strong> and those focused on <strong>OT operations</strong>‚Äîabout the challenges you

Deepfake technology led to sophisticated scams, making it harder to distinguish between real and fake.</p> <p>This is not just about being tricked by a single email, video, etc., but also about a growing crisis of trust in our digital communications. The fact that malicious actors can generate fake content that looks real means that our usual security practices are becoming obsolete.</p> <p>The implications of AI in cybersecurity aren&#39;t limited to deepfakes. Hackers are now using machine learning algorithms to refine their phishing tactics, making phishing attempts not only harder to spot but also more personalized.
