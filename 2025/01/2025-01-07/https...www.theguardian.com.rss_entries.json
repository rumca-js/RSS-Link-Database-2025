A new collection, Myself and Other Animals, traces the origins of his lifelong rapture with animals</p><p>As a toddler, Gerald Durrell was on a walk when he peered over the side of the road and spotted two creatures. \u201cThey were gently sliding over each other in what looked like a dance. They were a pale coffee colour with black, ridged stripes. They were glutinous and beautiful\u201d.</p><p>This rather flattering description of two slugs writhing in a ditch opens a new collection of writings by the beloved conservationist, who died in 1995 and would have turned 100 today, and it sets the tone for the book: all animals should be considered miraculous, conventional looks aside.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jan/07/remembering-gerald-durrell-100-myself-and-other-animals\">Continue reading...</a>",
