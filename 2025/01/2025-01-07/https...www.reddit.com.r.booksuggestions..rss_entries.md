<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I am looking to learn more about the mental health crisis going on in younger generations and how it ties to technology. Some books I&#39;ve read on addiction, trauma and personality disorders have touched on this to a greater or lesser degree, but I&#39;d love a book that directly goes into it and talks about it&#39;s effect psychologically on development and what not.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. Just as the title says i&#39;m looking for books where the character lives in a house that has multiple or infinite rooms that the character/characters enter through and they land in a different world with different time periods ( fantasy, medieval, etc. ) and they go on adventures and meet people, make friends, fall in love, etc. It&#39;d be nice if it was a whole series with each book centering on the characters spending in a single world. Bonus points if there is some Arab/Middle Eastern mythology but that&#39;s not a hard requiremtn. But i want it to be super atmospheric and immersive. Like the feeling you get when you are in a dream. So, can anyone recommend me any books like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LiliaAmazing"> /u/LiliaAmazing </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hw4ue9/im_looking_for_books_where_the_character_lives_in/">[link]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! </p> <p>I’m looking for book recommendations for my wife. She enjoys reading but prefers books that are easy to get into, with short chapters and a straightforward writing style. She is not into sci-fi, fantasy, romance, or anything space-related. She enjoys realistic stories and books with relatable characters.</p> <p>Here are my key requirements for the book recommendations: • Easy-to-read, quick chapters • Popular/modern titles from the last few years • Young adult books (preferably, but adult fiction is okay too if it fits the style) • No sci-fi, fantasy, romance, or space elements • Realistic themes, relatable characters, and engaging plots that aren’t too complex or dense</p> <p>We’re looking for books that are thought-provoking or have a strong emotional core, but not anything too heavy. A mix of coming-of-age stories, personal growth, or real-world challenges would be ideal.</p> <p>Any suggestions would be much appreciated!</p> </div><!--

For example, this week i was reading in the economist how certain scandinavian companies like IKEA, Ericsson, Legos have been running hugely successful global franchise and more profitable than other european firms. Everyone knows scandinavia leads in all aspects of human-development. Lot of things that are suggested to promote gender-equality, welfare and fertility rate already seem in place there and working well.<br/> So i wanted to understand more about the scandinavian society and culture, this also includes understanding the history, polity and economy but they are minor interests.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I’ve been wanting to read some romance lately.. but I’m realllly picky about what tropes I like and my male mcs specifically. I mostly read sci-fi / fantasy or comics but I want something more romance focused because I’m sad and lonely but need something fresh. Forgive me if this post uses to much terminally online fandom language - I don’t read a lot of romance so I only have the character dynamics that happen in other series to help describe what I’m seeking. Stuff I like:</p> <p>Jane Austen - pride and prejudice</p> <p>The Han Solo/Princess Leia dynamic - I find that outside of Star Wars OT and Rogue/Gambit in X-men this is rarely well executed. </p> <p>Batman in many ways is the ideal male mc for me. But I do not necessarily like the bat/cat dynamic. </p> <p>Lord of the rings -Aragorn The witcher- geralt/yen The expanse series - James Holden If you’re familiar with video games: I love Garrus Vakarian from mass effect.

I didn&#39;t like the style of writing in most of them- they were super simple and just felt &quot;cutesy&quot;, if that makes sense.

I love fantasy and mythology and everything that falls under these umbrella terms, however I have tried reading books like Forth Wing, but the writing was so similar to 14-year-old-writting-fanfiction that I couldn’t finish it. For reference a book series that I absolutely love with all my heart is The mists of Avalon. I am also willing to try some sci-fi or space related books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Parking-Ice3590"> /u/Parking-Ice3590 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hveh60/i_need_suggestions_for_fantasymythology_fiction/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hveh60/i_need_suggestions_for_fantasymythology_fiction/">[comments]</a></span>
