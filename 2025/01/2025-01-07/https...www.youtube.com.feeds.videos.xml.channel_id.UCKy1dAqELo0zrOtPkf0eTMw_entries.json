        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe latest Nintendo Switch 2 leak making the rounds on the internet has given gamers the best look yet of the purported new Joy-Con. In new leaked images, the the Joy-Con appear to feature a sensor that looks a lot like the optical sensors found on computer mice, suggesting that when turned on their side, the Joy-Con could be used like a mouse. The Switch 2 is not yet officially announced, although Nintendo has acknowledged they're working on the follow-up to the massively succesful Switch. In other news, Minecraft creator Notch has announced he wants to make a follow-up to the popular building/crafting sim. The problem is, he sold it all to Microsoft years ago, but he's willing to work something out if Microsoft is open to it.\nPresented by Goosebumps: The Vanishing - Streaming this Friday on DisneyPlus & on Hulu until 4/9/25!",
