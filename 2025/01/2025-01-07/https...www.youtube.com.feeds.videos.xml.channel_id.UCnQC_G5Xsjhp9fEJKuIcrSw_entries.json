        "description": "Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has been re-elected after Trump\u2019s endorsement. Moving forward, he is going to have to strategize regarding two big issues coming up this year in Congress: border security and tax cuts. Since Republicans don\u2019t have the majority in the Senate, they will have to be careful in their strategy. Ben also talks about Elon Musk\u2019s recent comments towards Keir Starmer, Great Britain\u2019s Prime Minister, about groups of Muslim men who were grooming young white girls while members of the authorities looked the other way and ignored the problem. Musk went after the prime minister because they rejected the request for a federal investigation into these grooming gangs. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Click here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/3WDjgHE\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Kick off 2025 with 25% off your new DailyWire+ annual membership.
