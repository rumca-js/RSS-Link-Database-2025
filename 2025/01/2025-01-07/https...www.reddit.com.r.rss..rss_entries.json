Some time back, I made an RSS aggregator on a no-code platform that aggregates Google and Bing news feeds, along with custom RSS feeds. For the news feeds, you input search terms and it adds the RSS url in the form:</p> <p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=word1+word2&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en\">https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=word1+word2&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=word1+word2&amp;format=rss\">https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=word1+word2&amp;format=rss</a></p> <p>I was pretty happy with it, until I revisted recently after a couple months. It seems to me that the number of news items is much fewer than before. There are especially few items over the last day or two. Some common topic search terms are not even showing anything for over a day. </p> <p>Could there be an issue with the services themselves, or something about my implementation?<br/> Are",
