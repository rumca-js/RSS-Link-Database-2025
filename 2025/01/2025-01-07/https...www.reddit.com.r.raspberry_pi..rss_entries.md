<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been trying to connect an ILI9488 touchscreen module to my RPi 5 so that I can use it for a project. This is the exact one I&#39;m using <a href="https://www.amazon.ae/dp/B0CGH9SBRP?social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_D58NWG0XT5CX0KTPRSMN&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;newOGT=1">https://www.amazon.ae/dp/B0CGH9SBRP?social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_D58NWG0XT5CX0KTPRSMN&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;newOGT=1</a> . I followed this script <a href="https://github.com/adamomd/ILI9488RPIScript">https://github.com/adamomd/ILI9488RPIScript</a> and executed all the commands on here to install the drivers. However, now my RPi 5 still won&#39;t use the display as it only shows a blank white screen. When I connect it via HDMI to a monitor, the Raspberry Pi OS welcome screen shows up and lingers for about a minute and then the screen just goes black. The RPi 5 still receives power and isn&#39;t broken so I am confused about what is happening. How do I fix this?<

It outputs power to a buck converter powering the Pi. The switched power also triggers a relais pulling a GPIO low when the ignition is turned off.</p> <p>With the help of a skript running on the Pi I&#39;d like to monitor the pinstate and when it goes low trigger a delayed graceful shutdown while the timer relais keeps the power up.</p> <p>Would following schematic work for that?
