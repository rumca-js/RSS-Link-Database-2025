Nvidia has upgraded its super resolution upscaling and ray reconstruction technology with a new 'vision transformer' model, offering some dramatic quality upgrades, while frame generation is boosted from one interpolated frame to two - or even three. The end result is a better-looking Cyberpunk 2077 capable of running the full path-traced experience at frame-rates well, well north of 120fps.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfou
