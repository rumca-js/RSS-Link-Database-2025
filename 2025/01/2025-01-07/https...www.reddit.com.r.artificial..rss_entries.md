<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Obviously, everyone has seen the clickbait titles about how AI will replace jobs, put businesses out of work, and all that doom-and-gloom stuff. But lately, it has been feeling a bit more realistic (at least, eventually). I just did a quick Google search for &quot;how many businesses will AI replace,&quot; and I came across a study by McKinsey &amp; Company claiming <em>&quot;that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs could be displaced by automation and AI globally&quot;.</em> That&#39;s only 5 years away. </p> <p>Friends and family working in different jobs / businesses like accounting, manufacturing, and customer service are starting to talk about it more and more. For context, I&#39;m in software development and it feels like every day there’s a new AI tool or advancement impacting this industry, sometimes for better or worse. It’s like a double-edged sword. On one hand, there’s a new market for businesses looking to adopt AI. That’s good news for now.
