The entire film is a beautiful culmination to the very final words delivered by Meryl Streep \u2018I have doubts\u2019. She is so clearly talking about her faith, from the very first scene introducing us to this journey, when Father Flynn\u2019s sermon talks about a crisis of faith - to the final scene showing the sister clutching her cross as she delivers those words. Meryl Streep again and again talks of her CERTAINTY about Flynns guilt, that certainty is vital to her entire character and motivations. She even says \u2018but i have my certainty\u2019 and then later on \u2018his resignation was his confession\u2019 - you can argue the film doesn\u2019t make it super clear wether Father Flynn is guilty, its no accident the words \u2018but did you prove it\u2019 are repeated, no solid proof just as ther",
