Is AI in art\nabout scaling and amplifying creativity, or just laziness? Can we maintain the artist to person\nconnection when using their likeness to perform? Either way, AI is being used in art like any\nother technological tool, and we need the guardrails to keep what\u2019s good.\n\nGet weekly AI, cloud, security and sustainability industry news, events and insights \u2192\nhttps://ibm.biz/BdGsAP\n\nThe opinions expressed in this podcast are solely those of the participants and do not necessarily reflect\nthe views of IBM or any other organization or entity.\n\n#AIguardrails #AIethics #AIscaling #AIrisks #artificialintelligence #Neyo #AIart\n#grammys #metaphysic",
