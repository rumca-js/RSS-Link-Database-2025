This year’s first IGN First “cover story” belongs to Monster Hunter Wilds, and we’re kicking off our exclusive coverage with two exclusive brand new videos featuring monsters of the Oilwell Basin. This Monster Hunter Wilds 4K gameplay video features Rompopolo, an especially grotesque Brute Wyvern. Don't miss the Ajarakan gameplay video, and check back throughout the month of January for more exclusive Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay, interviews, and more.

Recordings were taken from an in-development version of the game. Contents may differ in the product version. The build used for this gameplay also does not reflect some of the adjustments that were discussed in the December Community Update video (and was played before the update was published.) Specifically, we'd like to note that the bow's Focus Strike targeting will work differently in the final version of Monster Hunter Wilds.
