<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br/> I&#39;m writing a Reddit scraper to collect comments and submissions. The amount of data I need to scrape is approximately 7 billion rows per month (~10 million rows per hour). By &quot;rows,&quot; I mean submission and comment text content. I know that&#39;s a huge scale, but it&#39;s necessary to stay competitive in the task I&#39;m working on. I need help with structuring my project.</p> <p><strong>What have I tried?</strong></p> <p>I developed a test scraper for a single subreddit, and ran into two major problems:</p> <ol> <li>Fetching Submissions with lazy loading: To fetch a subreddit&#39;s submissions, I had to deal with lazy loading. I used Selenium to solve this, but it‚Äôs very heavy and it takes several seconds per query to mimic human behavior (e.g., scrolling with delays). This makes Selenium not scalable, because I will need a lot of Selenium instances to run asynchronously.</li> <li>Proxy Requirements for subr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been a huge increase in the amount of web scraping for LLM training recently, and I&#39;ve heard some people talk about it as if there&#39;s nothing they can do to stop it. This got me thinking, why not implement a super lightweight proof-of-work as a defense against it? If enough people threw up a proof-of-work proxy that took just a few milliseconds per request to solve, for example, large organizations would be financially deterred from repeatedly mass-scraping the internet, but normal users would see basically no difference. (Yes, there would inherently be a slight power draw increase, and yes it would scale massively if widely used and probably affect battery lives, but I think if it&#39;s scaled properly it can avoid negatively impacting users while still penalizing huge scrapers).</p> <p>I was surprised I couldn&#39;t find any existing solutions that implemented this, so I thew together a super basic proof of concept proxy for the

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have some stocks, and the complexity of tracking those from several sites with all different presentations and way too much extra data made me wonder if I could track them myself.</p> <p>Well, I can now, but the amount of advice I had to go through from experts, selling their product in the mean time, or enthusiasts and hobbyists using all sorts of code, languages and modules, was exhausting.</p> <p>And what I wanted was quite simple.. just one page in Excel or Calc, keeping track of my stock values, modestly refreshed every 5 minutes. And I had a fair idea of how to do that too. Scheduling the import of a csv file into a Calc work sheet is easy, as is referencing the imported csv values in another, my presentation sheet. So, creating this csv file with stock values became the goal. This is how I did it, eventually I mean, after first following all of the aforementioned advice, and then ignoring most of it, starting from scratch with this in mind:<
