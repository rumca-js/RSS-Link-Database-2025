NVIDIA just announced its RTX 50-series GPU lineup of video cards in the Blackwell architecture. These include the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, for which we also got most of the specs unveiled via the NVIDIA website. This follows on the same day as AMD's somewhat silent announcement of its RDNA4 RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 GPUs. As a reminder, Intel's Battlemage B570 part is also due to launch within about 10 days.

Aside from VRAM capacity and core counts for its new RTX 50 series, NVIDIA has also published numerous materials about varying "AI" solutions for gaming, including more frame generation. We won't go into any depth on these at this time, as we're still familiarizing ourselves with the materials, and will instead focus on the hardware.
