Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has been re-elected after Trump‚Äôs endorsement. Moving forward, he is going to have to strategize regarding two big issues coming up this year in Congress: border security and tax cuts. Since Republicans don‚Äôt have the majority in the Senate, they will have to be careful in their strategy. Ben also talks about Elon Musk‚Äôs recent comments towards Keir Starmer, Great Britain‚Äôs Prime Minister, about groups of Muslim men who were grooming young white girls while members of the authorities looked the other way and ignored the problem. Musk went after the prime minister because they rejected the request for a federal investigation into these grooming gangs.
