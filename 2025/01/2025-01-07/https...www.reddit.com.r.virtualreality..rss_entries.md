## Just finally played through Half-Life Alyx after years of putting off

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And as with every other Half-Life game, I find myself frustrated as hell at times, yet pulled into continuing the journey. This time, that effect is twofold due to the VR factor. </p> <p>The environments in this game are downright beautiful. Being able to just look around and be back in City 17, but like for real, was mindblowing. Being able to pick up and read a newspaper or labels on stuff like bottles/cans was strangely satisfying.</p> <p>Gunplay was surprisingly fluid. Only a few minutes after getting my pistol, reloading it was like second nature. Aiming the gun and lining up iron sights to simply point and shoot was some next level stuff. </p> <p>Same goes for the shotgun and SMG, though the shotgun reloading felt a bit inconsistent at times. My only complaint was that there was nothing provided that served a similar purpose to the crowbar in past games. I always appreciated that as an option to conserve ammo or just whack things.</p> <p>Unfort
