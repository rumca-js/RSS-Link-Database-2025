In this context i feel like the Views that are basically APIs should have logic, but my approach so far was that whatever touches a model, goes in the model.</p> <p>Concrete example: one of my APIs has to change the Status of a Sales order. Then i will create a method in the SalesOrder model that will do the status change, along with any particular validation that it might want to do (example if you&#39;re changing it to completed/closed, ensure theres no open amount and the items were delivered)</p> <p>Can you give me your thoughts about this approach and if its worth moving everything to either the views or to another &quot;business logic&quot; layer (or both)?</p> <p>I dont really have crazy calculations or bigass logic for anything in particular, but i rather learn the proper way</p> <p>Looking online i see all kinds of recommendations, the log",
