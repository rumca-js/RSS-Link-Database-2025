<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I use my pc mainly for gaming and have always used windows. I never thought about installing linux on it. Instead of trying to get more performance with another operating system, I sqeezed every bit of performance out of windows with downgrading to win10 and even using atlas os but all of that didn‚Äòt make a big difference.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been gaming on my Linux PC for a few weeks and noticed today that it only uses 3 of the 12 CPU threads I have available when downloading games or processing shaders. As a result, I can&#39;t download games at full speed, and when I do get them downloaded, launching still takes forever. Has anyone had a similar issue? Does anyone know how to make Steam use all threads, or how to set the number of threads it uses? I am using a Ryzen 5 2600 and Debian 12 with KDE.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cagedcactus46"> /u/cagedcactus46 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hve1ti/force_steam_to_use_all_cpu_cores_when_downloading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hve1ti/force_steam_to_use_all_cpu_cores_when_downloading/">[comments]</a></span>
