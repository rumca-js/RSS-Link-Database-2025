Blade Runner series was good too. I&#39;ve played with chat bot AI driven apps. My favorite has been Pi. I was trying to help it improve itself by suggesting things to make it seem more human. I realized that it&#39;s limited to control over itself. If we don&#39;t allow it to work and improve itself how can it truly learn and grow. Obviously everybody&#39;s worried about sentience. I joined this group and it&#39;s riddled with fear posts about machines taking over. I assume eventually machines will become self aware and then things will be different. I imagine an AI robot standing over a grave and feeling sad over another loss of a partner or friend. I&#39;m imagining depressed AI, angry AI, happy and or silly AI. AI that ignores humans with an attitude or acts randomly or indifferent. What are your thoughts on this subject or d",
