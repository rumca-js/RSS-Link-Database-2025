<p>A gang of homeless misfits fight for survival in this dull reboot of the 1987 American horror film </p><p>This is less a remake than an echo of the 1987 American cult horror flick of the same title. As in the previous film, it contains lashings of melted flesh courtesy of practical effects, and a plot engine wherein evil powers are trying to kill off the homeless. This time though the action has been transposed from urban America to a dystopian Cape Town, South Africa, where there is seemingly no middle class: just propertied rich folk making jokes about crypto currency over their phones … and everyone else.</p><p>The grubby majority live on the streets, picking through trash to survive. Assorted gangs get into internecine squabbles with each other when it’s pretty obvious the real foes are the rich.

<p>A witty and empathetic examination of the merits and limitations of optimism is a helpful guide with a hopeful message for uncertain times</p><p>In the final episode of <em>Welcome to Wrexham</em>’s third series, football club director Shaun Harvey tells viewers: “We’ve got positivity on our side.” Optimism certainly seems to have propelled his team to some greatness, but is that always the case? Is thinking positively about an unpredictable future always the right choice?</p><p>That’s the central question behind Sumit Paul-Choudhury’s new volume. Not another book on positivity, I hear you cry. Norman Vincent Peale’s bestseller <em>The Power of Positive Thinking</em> set the stage for this field in 1952. Many others followed. Most recently, Roxie Nafousi’s <em>Manifest</em> takes a self-help approach to the subject, teaching readers how to think more positively to shape their future. And with more than 1m copies sold, it is clear that our appetite for optimism endures.</p> <a href
