Blending Greek and Egyptian artistic traditions, the 4-inch figure portrays a muscular dwarf in motion. This cultural integration highlights the respect for dwarves in Egyptian society, associated with strength and protection.

        "description": "The Moon's surface undergoes extreme temperature shifts, ranging from over 100\u00b0C in daylight to minus 100\u00b0C in darkness. These fluctuations are due to the lack of atmosphere, which causes rapid temperature changes. The Moon's regolith, poor at conducting heat, leads to insulation at deeper levels. Shaded areas, particularly in lunar pits, maintain more stable temperatures, potentially crucial for future habitation. The poles, especially near the south, experience permanent shadows, making them ideal for ice trapping and human exploration",
