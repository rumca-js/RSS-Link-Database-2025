        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey so long story short my wife went thru a really nasty custody battle last year and we got full custody of our daughter. The dad is a registered pedophile but bc this is California they literally don&#39;t give a fuck so he still has phone calls with her. He sent her an iPad this Christmas. Its new in the box but me being me im curious. What&#39;s the chances a sealed iPad can have Spyware on it? Is there ways to potentially know if he had something put on it? Maybe i sound paranoid but we found it peculiar that he sent her an iPad when she&#39;s 5 years old. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid trying to protect my daughte but id like to know feom folks who actually hack shit if I&#39;m being paranoid for nothing or what. Any advise is appreciated. Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LucasHellaaShreddy\"> /u/LucasHellaaShreddy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1hvj",
