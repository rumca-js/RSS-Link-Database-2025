<p>Apple has been forced to admit what every company involved in artificial intelligence (AI) should also be forced to state — AI makes mistakes, just like people do. </p>



<p>On the surface, it’s not a terribly big deal:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apple’s AI badly mangled a handful of news headlines. </li>



<li>The BBC complained about the mangling. </li>



<li>Because it was a story about Apple, everyone discussed it.</li>



<li>Apple was eventually forced to answer the criticisms and come up with a plan of action to make things better in the future. </li>
</ul>



<p>What that plan means is that the company will update Apple Intelligence “in the coming weeks” with an update tha

<p>The US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has filed a fresh complaint against Google, alleging that the company acts as the employer of certain contract workers and must negotiate with their union, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-should-be-forced-bargain-with-contractors-union-us-labor-agency-says-2025-01-06/">reports</a>.</p>



<p>The Board has said Google is a “joint employer” for roughly 50 San Francisco-based content creators hired through IT contractor Accenture Flex.</p>



<p>These workers, who joined the Alphabet Workers Union in 2023, should be considered under the tech giant’s purview, according to the agency, the report said.</p>

<p>Nvidia has built its generative AI (genAI) business on delivering massive computing capacity to data centers where it can be used to train and refine <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1627101/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs). </p>



<p>Now, the company is readying a diminutive desktop device called Project DIGITS, a “personal AI supercomputer” with a lightweight version of the Grace Blackwell platform found in its most powerful servers; it’s aimed at data scientists, researchers, and students who will be able to prototype, tune, and run large genAI models.</p>

<p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reinvigorated discussion of artificial general intelligence (AGI), boldly claiming that his company’s newest model has reached that milestone.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sam-altman-interview/">interview with Bloomberg</a>, he noted that OpenAI’s o3, which was announced in December and is currently being safety tested, has passed the ARC-AGI challenge, the leading benchmark for AGI. Now, Altman said, the company is setting its sights on superintelligence, which is leaps and bounds beyond AGI, just as AGI is to AI. </p>



<p>According to ARC-AGI, “OpenAI’s new o3 system — trained on the ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set — has scored a b
