## Terminator Resistance was great, but all the pb and 1337 links only contain the Annihilation Line DLC or The Infiltrator Mode DLC, never both. Is my torrent-fu weak or is it the way the game was cracked and updated? If the only way is to play both is downloading & installing in a separate directory?

It&#39;s easier to communicate there than to switch back and forth between other sites. There&#39;s been an issue on there for a while where basically all of Facebook is nothing but random pages. Even when you go to your friends feed that stuff still sneaks its way in somehow. I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say this, this morning there were over 70 posts in a row that were from random pages. I don&#39;t follow a single one of those pages. I&#39;ve never liked any of their content. Most of it looks to be AI or people copying and pasting Wiki articles. It&#39;s fucking annoying. Everyone hates it. UBlock Origin, AdBlocker, Pie, etc. doesn&#39;t help. VPN doesn&#39;t help. Different browsers doesn&#39;t help.
