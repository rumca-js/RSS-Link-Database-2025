They have corrected the PCB and rescheduled production to ensure that customers receive products without any signal quality problems.</p> <p>We are committed to providing you with the best products. Thank you once again for your support. If you are in a hurry, you can apply for a refund and wait for the available stock. </p> <p>Thank you for your understanding in advance.</p> <hr/> <p>&quot;Spring Festival&quot;, aka Chinese New Year, starts on January 29.</p> <p>They had been promising to ship within 30 days of ordering, and orders opened on November 25.</p> <p>Of course it is better to have a working product :-) ",
