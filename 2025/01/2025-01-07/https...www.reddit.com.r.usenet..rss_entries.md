<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really got into using Usenet I currently have althub and nzbgeek. I&#39;ve been searching the reddit and seeing a lot of mentions of both ninjacentral and drunkenslug. I&#39;ve been wondering which I should get and if there are any other recommendations. Also how often do they accept new members like open registration? I know drunkenslug currently has invite only on and ninjacentral is currently closed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sandshark147"> /u/Sandshark147 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hvkk8m/whats_the_next_indexer_i_should_get/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1hvkk8m/whats_the_next_indexer_i_should_get/">[comments]</a></span>
