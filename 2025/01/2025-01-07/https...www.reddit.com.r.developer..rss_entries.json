Instead, it feels like many managers and leaders are more concerned with profits and bonuses. It makes me wonder\u2014could it be time for an international developer strike?</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, this might not resonate with everyone, but after reading numerous DevRel, DevEx, and developer reports/surveys, I\u2019ve noticed a significant number of devs and engineers feeling frustrated with their work environments. And let\u2019s not even start on the layoffs, often justified by some grand idea of cutting devs in favor of GenAI or other agents to boost profits and lower development costs.</p> <p>I\u2019m just curious and trying to reflect. What\u2019s your take on this? What have your experiences been? Is it time for a developer strike to capture attention.</p> </d",
