<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My dad, a rock musician, passed away five years ago, leaving behind about 2,500 CDs from an album he released 15 years ago. It’s hard to just throw them away, especially since he has a small overseas fan base that might still be interested in purchasing them. I’ve considered selling them on Amazon, but with their fees and the potential for low sales volume, I don’t want to end up essentially paying to give them away. I’d really appreciate any recommendations or ideas on how to sell these CDs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>All Trance subgenres I have heard (Uplifting, Progressive, Emotional) sounds kind of the same to me. I have heard of Psytrance and its subgenres (Full On, Goa, Dark, Hi-tech) but they usually vary by effects, tempo, and sometimes vibe. I really wanna try to listen to other forms of Trance and maybe even try to make one but they all just sound similar to me.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to any answers and clarifications regarding this topic! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extension_Sir3277"> /u/Extension_Sir3277 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hvri9y/question_are_there_any_more_trance_subgenres_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hvri9y/question_are_there_any_more_trance_subgenres_that/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. I had a question regarding a song by Crush 40, titled I am... All of Me. I&#39;ve been debating using this as an entrance theme for professional wrestling for a short while. I&#39;ve been advised by one of my bookers not to use music that could get the videos of the shows in hot water, or taken down in some way. Yet I&#39;m unsure how to check and see if this song would qualify or have some sort of fair use. Alternatively, I could use a cover, as well, if that would work instead. Some help would be massively appreciated! thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pleasant-Category272"> /u/Pleasant-Category272 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hvk5or/copyright_law_and_crush_40_i_am_all_of_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hvk5or/copyright_law_and_crush_40_i_am_all_of_me/">[comments]</a></span>

Also you can&#39;t call Head a one hit wonder because of this even though lots of poeple do. Also the song is actually just called &quot;Superstar&quot; but nobody knows it by that name. </p> <p>So there you go. YOu also now know that weird little fact.
