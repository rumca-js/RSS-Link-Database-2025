<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. Recently it came to my mind a Fighting Arcade Game that I played alot in my childhood. It was between the &#39;95 and the &#39;00, but can&#39;t be sure if it was released between those years, it might be older.</p> <p>Something I do remember is one of the fighters could summon a giant frog that spat out fire, amongst other abilities. I hope someone can help me remember, and thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyMaster89"> /u/KeyMaster89 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hw4t9q/trying_to_remember_an_arcade_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hw4t9q/trying_to_remember_an_arcade_game/">[comments]</a></span>

## The most obscure of the Genki games. Also a very underrated racing experience. "Kaido Battle"-series or as it was strangely named in the US "Tokyo Xtreme Racer Drift". The thing is, the naming really hurt its marketing because it is NOT a drifting game. It's all about "Kaido" racing on mountains.

The whole thing was in bright trippy psychedelic colors and had a pumping 90s-style rave soundtrack. I played it for hours as a teenager as it was hypnotic and I&#39;d love to find it again.

## Good Scart to scart cable?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was looking up connections for the dreamcast and ran across the whole VGA box thing. Looks like the best third party box for my use case is the torro, which has a VGA out and a scart out for the games that dont support VGA. The only issue is that my understanding of scart cables is that they need to be wired correctly, and I need a male to male connection from the box to what will be my switch. I have no idea if the wiring for this kind of connection would matter and it looks like most of the sellers I would trust don&#39;t have one anyway. Even amazon seems to only have 2 that are male to male. Any help is appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Repulsive-Air5428"> /u/Repulsive-Air5428 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hvespk/good_scart_to_scart_cable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1hvespk/good_sca
