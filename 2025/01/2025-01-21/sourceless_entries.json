Trump said that his administration is mulling imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada as soon as Feb. 1 - a move which doused investors' hopes of a delay after they had been cheering the brief mention of tariffs in his inauguration speech.",

Both pose potential challenges in an economy where inflation has edged slowly closer to the Fed's 2% target without the recession and large rise in unemployment that some central bank officials felt would be needed for price pressures to ebb.  The unemployment rate instead fell as low as 3.4% and ended 2024 at 4.1%, close to what many economists think the economy can support without reigniting price pressures; inflation has declined to perhaps just half a percentage point from the Fed's target.",

For example, if you invested just $100 into the average dividend stock 50 years ago, that investment would have grown to $8,756 five decades later (assuming you reinvested those dividends).  The best returns came from dividend growers (they turned a $100 investment made 50 years ago into $14,118, compared to $2,788 for those with no change in their dividend policies and $73 for dividend cutters and eliminators).",

But there were no specific Day One measures on long-promised trade tariffs - something flagged early on Monday by a Wall Street Journal report that weakened the U.S. dollar sharply and lifted overseas stock markets seen to be in the firing line.",

The agency launched an investigation into Alphabet Inc's Google in 2022 on suspicion it had abused its dominant position by requiring Indonesian app developers to use Google Pay Billing, at higher rates than other payment systems, or face removal from the Google Play Store.  The panel said in a hearing that the systems reduced developers' earnings as they led to the reduction of users, adding Google has been found breaking Indonesia\u2019s law against monopoly.",

The Federal Emergency Management Association and the Red Cross advise that households gather important documents and contacts in a safe place, take photographs or record a video of the rooms in your home and any valuable belongings, and to have cash on hand, in case ATMs and electronic or online banking resources aren\u2019t available, among other guidance.  Lisa Berdie, director of policy and research for the Financial Health Network, an organization that focuses on underserved consumers, refers to these steps as \u201cpreparedness,\u201d but stresses the need for \u201cinvestments in efforts to lessen the severity of climate impacts, reduce risks, and minimize financial harm.\u201d",
