<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>Back in 2020 I stupidly downloaded a video game from a dodgy website. It&#39;s worked amazingly, but one time, shortly into downloading it, my Bitdefender told me that there was malware in the program, and successfully quarantined it. I played it daily for years afterward.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2025. I still can&#39;t afford the video game in question, so on a fresh install of Windows 11 (I wanted to upgrade and lose all the fluff and dead weight files) I installed it once more, from the original file. I&#39;d previously tested it on a virtual machine and with Virus total, seemed okay. I thought perhaps the original flags on my Bitdefender could have been a false positive.</p> <p>Fast forward a week and a half, Bitdefender tells me the program has tried to execute a line of code in system32, and it&#39;s prevented it from happening. I look up said line of code, and find a page hosted by Avast for Crackonosh - <a href="https://decoded.
