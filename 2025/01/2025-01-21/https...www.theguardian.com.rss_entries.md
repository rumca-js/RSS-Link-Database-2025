It was of course possible to understand his election in 2016 as a fluke, a win delivered by the Electoral College over the opposition of most voters. But the legitimacy of his election this time around has shifted the mood around his second inauguration significantly. The protests have been sparser, the liberal pundits are quieter, the resistance, all told, seems weaker. Ten years into the Trump era and due for at least another four, we’ve been humbled into near-impotence, a victory for the only ideology Trump has ever been committed to, which is humiliation.</p><p>It must have been a real pleasure, given this, to have Biden, Harris, and much of the Democratic party’s leadership sit and listen Monday afternoon to an inaug

<p>Free to explore my hilly corner of the countryside, I found hidden paths to sacred springs, prehistoric monoliths, empty swimming holes …</p><p>When I moved from London to a hilly area of rural France in 2017, I brought my bike with me. A faithful secondhand racer, it had served me well over the years to commute from south to central London. On day two in France, I took it out on the road and was completely exhausted by the time I got to the next village, 2km and four big hills away. I put the bike in the shed and forgot about it.</p><p>But I didn’t forget about cycling. With its empty roads and miles of meandering logging paths through ancient woodland, the area around my home is perfect for the adventurous cyclist. If only I could overcome the exhaustion problem.
