<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for innovative fantasy books that are also excellent. It could be something in the setting of the book, structure, magic etc. A book that you read and thought, wow this is different in an inventive, creative way that is done really well and also, the book overall is excellent.</p> <p>For some examples:</p> <p>-Piranesi (setting)</p> <p>-The Broken Earth Trilogy, The Princess Bride, Flowers for Algernon (structure)</p> <p>-Mistborn (magic, innovative for when it came out)</p> <p>-The Lord of the Rings (everything, copied a million times, still nothing really like it)</p> <p>A few caveats:</p> <ol> <li><p>Not looking for grimdark or romantasy or a lot of explicit sex scenes, romance is fine but it shouldn&#39;t take over the plot.</p></li> <li><p>Has great female characters, doesn&#39;t have to be the main character</p></li> <li><p>Looking a bit off the beaten path from the major popular series, which I&#39;m familiar with already.</p><

Whilst I like the newer ones I don’t think the SIZE of what it’s turning into is for me.</p> <p>I loved the first law trilogy especially Logen and Glokta but I wasn’t the biggest fan of the standalone first law books. I think the biggest pull there for me again was the character development especially.</p> <p>I read the will of the many and loved it.</p> <p>My other favourite books are the count of Monte Cristo and the mythos series by Stephen Fry</p> <p>My favourite games are Skyrim, AC4 Black Flag, Baldurs gate 3 if that helps too!</p> <p>Any suggestion is greatly welcomed thanks!</p> </div><!--

I think the series as a whole is now solidly in my top ten personal favorite fiction series of all time. The characters are richly developed, the pros is gorgeous, the stories are compelling, and the magic systems and world-building are absolutely top notch. Really some of the most interesting and philosophically complex writing about magic I’ve ever encountered. </p> <p>I was struck by how much emotion Le Guin infuses into her characters. They don’t just walk around doing stuff, they really make you feel. </p> <p>Can’t recommend this series highly enough to anyone who hasn’t experienced it!

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I posted this in another thread but I think it is an interesting enough idea to warrant its own:</p> <p>I have a hot take about the First Law Trilogy: you are more likely to enjoy it if you read a lot of fantasy. Like, A LOT. The First Law Trilogy works the same way that Watchmen does. The protagonists being assholes, failures, and tragically regressing works MUCH better if you&#39;ve seen similar characters heroically overcome their flaws to save the day many times before.</p> <p>It makes other fantasy better too because Tanis Half-Elven or Drizzt succeeding now has a contrast of heroes who absolutely don&#39;t. I love traditional fantasy but I also feel like its good to have some books where the attempts to Zig instead Zag.</p> <p>Like the whole point of Quentyn Martell&#39;s story is that he&#39;s a bookish nerdy hero out to win the heart of a beautiful Princess and decides to do something grand and epic--that backfires horribly. Because he&#39;s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Written by Phyllis Ann Karr - <em>The Idylls of the Queen</em> references almost every Arthurian myth you can think of, interweaving dozens of legends into one fascinating murder mystery. You probably do need at least a basic knowledge of the King Arthur stories to appreciate this one. It&#39;s very dense, with names and stories thrown about on every page. But believe me, the book is worth the time invested in it. </p> <p>The book focuses on a Knight of the Round Table poisoned by an apple, with Queen Guinevere accused of the murder. Our heroes must attempt to find the murderer. Our detective is Sir Kay, King Arthur&#39;s bitter and snarky stepbrother. His Watson? Sir Mordred. Yes, that Mordred, the final villain of the Arthurian saga/</p> <p>Karr&#39;s true strength lies in her character work. Nearly every character is given a chance to tell their side of the story. Yet she also does the delicate but wonderful job of showing that for all their excus

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love fantasy, but find myself switching off during long battle scenes or fighting scenes. I do still enjoy fighting in my stories, but I&#39;m looking for recommendations where these scenes are shorter and to the point, rather than draging on for pages/chapters. I&#39;m also not really a fan of sories with intense romantic plots (in a horny YA way) although I&#39;m still fine with it being there at a more mature and realistic level.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sassyrats"> /u/sassyrats </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i66jvp/fantasy_recs_without_too_much_fighting_or_fucking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i66jvp/fantasy_recs_without_too_much_fighting_or_fucking/">[comments]</a></span>
