        "description": "Hundreds of hidden supermassive black holes have been identified using infrared observations, offering fresh insights into their role in galaxy formation. Researchers relied on data from NASA's Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) to detect emissions from black holes obscured by thick clouds of gas and dust. Findings suggest up to 35% of supermassive black holes are hidden, a significant increase from earlier estimates. These discoveries highlight the importance of advanced infrared and X-ray technologies in revealing the unseen aspects of the universe and improving our understanding of how these massive entities regulate star formation and influence the structure of galaxies. Scientists believe these observations may reshape theories of cosmic evolution.",

The two-stage process uses microbial electrosynthesis to turn CO2 into acetate, which is then used by bacteria to produce single-cell protein. This system promises a more sustainable and cost-effective approach to food production, with minimal wastewater and operational costs, offering a potential solution to global food and environmental challenges.",

Using computer simulations, researchers found that in about 1% of the scenarios, such a close encounter could explain the planets\u2019 unusual orbital paths and deviations from circular orbits. This hypothesis challenges previous explanations centered on planetary interactions and suggests that flybys of substellar objects might be more common in the cosmos than once thought.

The research, involving laboratory experiments with plexiglass, found that slow, aseismic movements at fault lines can build up energy. Once a critical point is reached, the energy is released suddenly, triggering an earthquake. This discovery could help in predicting seismic events by detecting the transition from slow-moving stress to rapid rupture",

Ongoing research focuses on monitoring cardiovascular health, muscle fitness, cognitive performance, and sensory perception. Wearable Bio-Monitor sensors track vital signs such as pulse rate and blood pressure, while devices like Myotones assess muscle stiffness. Studies also evaluate cognitive changes due to radiation and sleep disruptions. Findings aim to develop countermeasures to maintain astronaut health during long-term missions and assist with readjustment upon return to Earth.",

Using advanced full-waveform inversion, scientists were able to map these structures, revealing hidden patterns that challenge current geological understanding. These anomalies were discovered far from tectonic activity zones, raising questions about their origin. Researchers speculate that these blobs could be remnants of ancient crust or dense material formed billions of years ago. The findings are significant for understanding Earth's internal structure and may offer new insights into the planet's geological history. While their exact nature remains unclear, ongoing research aims to uncover the material properties behind these mysterious anomalie.",

Using data from the Large Hadron Collider and advanced quantum information science, evidence of entanglement between quarks and gluons was found within the proton. This discovery challenges long-standing perceptions and provides new insights into the behaviour of fundamental particles. Researchers are now exploring how entanglement might affect atomic nuclei structures in future experiments.",
