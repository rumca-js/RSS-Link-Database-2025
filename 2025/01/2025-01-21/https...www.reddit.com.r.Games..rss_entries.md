<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve probably all played MOBAs, bless our hearts, but if not, let me explain one of the basic gameplay mechanics. </p> <p>In MOBA games like DOTA and LoL, you control a character, and your goal is to get the minions/creeps to the opponent&#39;s base and destroy it. Your job is to guard them by killing your opponents&#39; minions/creeps and killing the opponent players who are trying to do the same to yours. Essentially, you protect and escort weak little guys whose job it is to destroy the enemy base. </p> <p>Dynasty Warriors Origins has you filling a somewhat similar role. You play as a single character the whole game this time, but your role on the battlefield is largely to go around helping your allies who are having trouble, strategically focusing on the most important areas. </p> <p>This really scratches an itch I&#39;ve had after playing MOBAs but not really getting into the multiplayer or competitive side. I want to play as a powerful cha

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Over the weekend, I started a new file for Hollow Knight. Ive tried a few times to get into it, but never got far before losing interest. I&#39;ve never been one to care about a game <em>just</em> because of its popularity and status as a &quot;classic&quot;(I prefer Chrono Cross waaaaaaaay more than Trigger), but as a lover of Metroidvanias, I wanted to give this game is due attention. So here I am, trying it for a 3rd or 4th time.</p> <p>All of this got me wondering about a topic I rarely, if ever, get discussed: Second chace games. Games you didntnlike, but gave another shot.</p> <p>For another example, I remember being pretty eh on New Vegas after playing 3, viewing it as just more of the same. But with a second effort, I &quot;got&quot; it. Meanwhile, after multiple attempts to get into Destiny, Ive determined its just simply not for me.</p> <p>What are your second chance games? Which finally landed and which sank again? What was the X factor th
