Extending battery life is a major engineering challenge, but what if there was a battery that could last over 100,000 cycles? A battery that could go an entire lifetime with little to no degradation? Imagine guaranteeing performance not just for years — but decades. Well, a team in Germany might have just made it a reality, turning a notoriously short-lived battery into one of the longest-lasting ever. How did scientists pull this off? And more importantly, when can we start seeing these batteries in our phones and EVs?
