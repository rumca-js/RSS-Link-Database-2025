This is such a great community that has shown so much love to our family business the few times I\u2019ve share our story in comments. So I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you all might have\u2026or if anyone is looking in advice to start their own game company.</p> <p>For those interested in our story on how we got here, I\u2019ve typed it out below.

I&#39;m considering these games:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Champions of Midgard</strong></li> <li><strong>Blood Rage</strong></li> <li><strong>Dune Imperium</strong></li> <li><strong>Terraforming Mars</strong></li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m open to pretty much any board game (except Azul!), but my friends are still relatively new to the hobby. They&#39;ve played Catan (as simple game) and even Game of Thrones, so they can handle a bit of complexity.</p> <p>I&#39;m drawn to Champions of Midgard and Blood Rage because we all love those themes (Vikings and mythology!). Dune Imperium and Terraforming Mars have also caught my eye due to their great reviews. Plus, everyone in the group is familiar with Dune and has read the books.</p> <p>Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

We\u2019ve been playing a certain way for a while but after closely reading the rules, we\u2019re unsure if we\u2019re following the rules about communication correctly. We say things like \u201cThat helped\u201d or \u201cno change for me\u201d when a new community card is dropped. We tried playing with saying even less and almost just silently taking and swapping the chips. But we found that less fun than chatting at least this little bit, still without directly saying our hand.</p> <p>The question is, how do you limit your communication while playing? My thinking is that us saying stuff like this amounts to the same as taking a higher chip before anyone else, so it shouldn\u2019t matter much with small comments like this. But I\u2019d love to hear some insight from other people on how you follow these rules?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Peterrefic\"> /u/Pet",

The issue is that the amount of people can vary pretty wildly (anywhere from 4-8) and while at 4/5 the player count is generally supported and at 8 we can split into 2 groups of 4 (although not ideal so we end up just playing stuff like Just One and Decrypto), 6/7 is a bit of an awkward middle ground where the split groups are pretty small and we\u2019d rather just play something all together.</p> <p>So I\u2019m looking for recommendations on games that are kind of crunchy but still teachable to people who don\u2019t play much and just drop in and out (not sure if the equivalent weight would be a &lt;= 3 on BGG).
