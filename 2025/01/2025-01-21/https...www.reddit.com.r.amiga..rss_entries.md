<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I posted here about a month ago shortly explaining how i was interested in backing up/imaging the contents of the old hard drive of my amiga 1200. Since then i&#39;ve gotten my hands on a PCMCIA card as the drive is still working well. Again not being able to find any sufficient information online, I&#39;m wondering how this would be done. Does anyone happen to know how to?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sirmors"> /u/Sirmors </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i6r3oc/backing_up_files_from_an_old_hard_drive_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1i6r3oc/backing_up_files_from_an_old_hard_drive_with/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My brother and I, both in our 50s, shared a deep bond with our father through our love of the Amiga 1200 in our early 20s around 1992 or so. We spent countless hours playing games like Defender of the Crown, Wings, and Lemmings together, creating cherished memories.</p> <p>Tragically, our father passed away unexpectedly. The Amiga became a symbol of those precious times, and the memories we&#39;ve held dear for years.</p> <p>Now, my brother Mark is facing a serious illness and has limited time. He recently shared his bucket list, and one of his wishes is to revisit those Amiga games with me, reliving the joy and connection we shared with our father.</p> <p>This has deeply moved me, but I&#39;m completely overwhelmed by the technical aspects of setting this up. I&#39;m looking for someone with expertise in the Amiga world who can guide me through creating a functional and user-friendly system for my Brother.</p> <p>Ideally, I&#39;d like to have an Ami
