<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would like to build an app to help diners to find dishes they most likely enjoy via some ML model. But I need to get access to individual restaurant reviews, like those in Yelp or Google Reviews. Not only they seem to have stated in their terms of service that scraping is not allowed, their API endpoints only provide up to 3 reviews per restaurants which is useless for ML training.</p> <p>Does anyone know any opensource restaurant review data available?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The requirement is to make a Python scraper that can scrape emails from any website. The scraper should have the crawl feature to identify email regex Or find it from header or footer. Basically I need a scraper that if we input a bulk count of websites that can retrieve the emails from each website in csv format. It should have capability of scanning whole website like their about us page or contact us page to identify emails. I had built one using chromedriver and selenium but it is slow and some website dynamics aren&#39;t supported and emails aren&#39;t being scraped. I could use some help here.
