<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, I built a curation newsletter ai generator, but the goal is to use quality content as the source, so I built a rss reader and on each article you read, you can add the article to a newsletter issue of your choice, once you have enough articles you can generate your newsletter issue.</p> <p>I have some users testing the newsletter part, and I wanted to know if some of you could give me feedback on the rss feed part, if it&#39;s good enough to use/browse and so on.</p> <p>You can see it in action before creating your account here <a href="https://researca.com/">https://researca.com/</a></p> <p>If you want to test, and give me some feedback leave a reply or dm me.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FireNunchuks"> /u/FireNunchuks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1i6ez6q/seek_feedback_for_rss_component_in_my_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a
