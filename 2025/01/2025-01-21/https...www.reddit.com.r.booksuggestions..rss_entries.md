<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, </p> <p>Since I was little I have this game I make with books: I group them (nothing strange here) but not by author or by characters, but by story. So I make trilogies that I read in a specific order, this gives me the most satisfaction. Some of these trilogies or me-arranged series take years to finish, because of course I have to read a book and get to know it before pairing it with another one. </p> <p>Now I am looking for a 3rd book for my most recent series: </p> <ol> <li>Emi Yagi &quot;Diary of a Void&quot;</li> <li>Otessa Moshfegh &quot;My Year of Rest and Relaxation&quot; 3.?</li> </ol> <p>Can you help?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I am looking to replace my doom-scrolling with reading. I already read a ton, but I want to find something I can pick up and put down really easily.</p> <p>For example, I read “What If” by Randall Munroe, and it was perfect. Short sections which weren’t all related to one another, and I felt like I was learning something, and being productive with my time.</p> <p>I’m open to pretty much anything! I mostly read on a Kindle, so preferably something that doesn’t rely on colors. Also, preferably something with short sections, so I can pick it up and put it down pretty easily / quickly, but that isn’t a requirement! I guess I’m picturing non-fiction, but that also isn’t a requirement.</p> <p>Note: I’m not a huge fan of poetry, so please refrain from poetry suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/macthepenn"> /u/macthepenn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/c

I’m desperately looking for better thrillers with twists that are actually well crafted. </p> <p>The Housemaid: I read it in English. I enjoyed it because it was addictive and the dark humour was unmatched, but I didn’t think it was brilliant and it didn’t leave me at the edge of my seat. The writing was so juvenile, it read like a diary sometimes. The ending was just stupid—I don’t believe a single thing that happened in this book could’ve happened in real life. An enjoyable mess.</p> <p>The Silent Patient: this one was SO good, I really believed I was about to rate it 5 stars. The twist had me flabbergasted. But at the same time…. was that it? I was waiting so badly for the reason she was silent and… for that? Also I read some reviews

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I read a lot of fantasy and mystery books. I am particularly a sucker for good mystery books where the main protagonist is a detective solving a case (think most of Agatha Christie). Keeping that in mind, I picked up Louise Penny&#39;s first novel, Still Life.</p> <p>And I just couldn&#39;t...get past 50 pages? It felt like I was watching a badly edited movie. Characters were talking aimlessly, there seemed to be no end or beginning to any conversation etc.</p> <p>Now, like I said, I just read 50 pages, and sure it could get better, but just wanted to ask the people here..does it get better? I really wanted to give this series a go. Want to get other people&#39;s opinions on this, does the series and writing get better with time? Or is it more of the same?</p> <p>Would also be happy if someone could suggest other books of such genres, where a detective solves a case. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u

Her story of survival and resilience after the acid attack she endured was incredibly powerful and moving. It’s amazing to see how far she’s come since then—she’s now a TV presenter, motivational speaker, and founder of her own charity to support other burn survivors.</p> <p>Today, she announced her new book, <em>Still Beautiful</em>, on Instagram. Knowing how honest and raw Katie’s writing is, I have no doubt this will be just as inspiring as her first. She’s a true example of turning pain into purpose, and I can’t wait to read her latest work.</p> <p>Anyone else thinking of grabbing a copy? 😊</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FiveManDown"> /u/FiveManDown </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i6mc3g/katie_pipers_new_book_still_beautiful_cant_wait/">[lin

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! Wondering if people have any suggestions for espionage novels with a sci-fi element. I&#39;m thinking something that&#39;s less focused on aliens or tech but uses it as a backdrop/plot element; big space ship, small guy inside it. I still like most of my characters to be talkative triple-crossing humans. It&#39;s a genre I&#39;m not very well versed in, but for some reference, I really enjoyed the short stories of James Tiptree Jr, in particular &quot;Mamma Come Home&quot; which has a faint whiff of government/intelligence people as they work with aliens. I also really really love Metal Gear. I&#39;m currently thinking about getting into John Le Carré, I&#39;ve heard his books have a lot of the Jargon and detail that I love to get immersed into. I love good dialogue. One billion bonus points if there&#39;s gay men in it.</p> <p>Edit: also really loved Foundation. It didn&#39;t focus on &quot;espionage&quot; per say, but it had a lot of moving

I just want her to do knight stuff and everyone to be fine with it.</em></p> <p>My imagined ideal novel would be a King Arthur retelling where everything is the same but like at least half the round table happens to be made up of women, and probably Merlin is a girl too.
