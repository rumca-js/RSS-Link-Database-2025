<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve played a couple a games but I have a question about how monster invasions work, so my understanding is that you can only invade in an empty village under normal circumstances but for monsters like the troll where it says destroys all warriors does this allow for the invasion of an otherwise non invadable place: For example, if the province has 5 slots and another player has a warrior, their leader, and the dwarf so there are two empty slots, can the troll invade this province despite even after removing the warrior the province would not be empty? Or am I misunderstanding something. Thanks</p> <p>EDIT: It seems I understood the game wrong, in my mind I was treating provinces and villages as the same things but I now understand that the villages are the circles and the broader borders are the provinces</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeliciousAstronomer6"> /u/DeliciousAstronomer6 </a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently started playing “The Gang” with friends from work and having a blast. We’ve been playing a certain way for a while but after closely reading the rules, we’re unsure if we’re following the rules about communication correctly. We say things like “That helped” or “no change for me” when a new community card is dropped. We tried playing with saying even less and almost just silently taking and swapping the chips. But we found that less fun than chatting at least this little bit, still without directly saying our hand.</p> <p>The question is, how do you limit your communication while playing? My thinking is that us saying stuff like this amounts to the same as taking a higher chip before anyone else, so it shouldn’t matter much with small comments like this. But I’d love to hear some insight from other people on how you follow these rules?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Peterrefic"> /u/Pet

The issue is that the amount of people can vary pretty wildly (anywhere from 4-8) and while at 4/5 the player count is generally supported and at 8 we can split into 2 groups of 4 (although not ideal so we end up just playing stuff like Just One and Decrypto), 6/7 is a bit of an awkward middle ground where the split groups are pretty small and we’d rather just play something all together.</p> <p>So I’m looking for recommendations on games that are kind of crunchy but still teachable to people who don’t play much and just drop in and out (not sure if the equivalent weight would be a &lt;= 3 on BGG).
