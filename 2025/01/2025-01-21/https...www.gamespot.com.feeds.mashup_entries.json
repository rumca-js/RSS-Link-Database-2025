While last year started off strong with hit games like Helldivers 2 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, there were also some big misses along the way. The failure of Concord is still fresh in everyone's minds, Sony's mandatory PSN sign-in requirements for its PC ports created an uproar, and its first-party offerings were slim when compared to previous years. So what can fans expect from Sony and PlayStation 5 more generally in 2025?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As usual, Sony is keeping quiet on its 2025 plans, but a few details have been revealed so far. While 2025 currently looks light on exclusives, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei looks like it could be the highlight of the year. Beyond that samurai adventure, we're also hoping for updates on FairGame$, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophecy, The Midnight Walk, and Marvel's Wolverine, while Sony's t",

My gameplay was primarily focused around combat and exploring the Madlantis area of the game. It was a short-lived experience, but it was so much fun to play as the goofy Mad Dog again, and I couldn't wait for a chance to play more.</p><p>We are now less than a month away from Pirate Yakuza's release and I finally got that chance to play a full hands-on experience of the more silly and exciting new content this game has to offer. Based on just a few hours of gameplay, I couldn't believe how much is packed into this game, and they only allowed us to explore a small part of it.
