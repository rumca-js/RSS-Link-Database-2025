<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am developing a search engine. I need ideas and suggestions. Do the parameters that categorize search results like &quot;All, Images, Videos&quot; work for you? Would it work if parameters like &quot;Movies, Games&quot; were added? Or do you have any ideas like &quot;this parameter is unnecessary&quot;? Also, I am open to ideas and suggestions on any subject.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/topraqa"> /u/topraqa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1i6bgz9/im_developing_a_search_engine/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1i6bgz9/im_developing_a_search_engine/">[comments]</a></span>
