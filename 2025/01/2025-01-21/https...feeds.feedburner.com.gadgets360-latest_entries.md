Hundreds of hidden supermassive black holes have been identified using infrared observations, offering fresh insights into their role in galaxy formation. Researchers relied on data from NASA's Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) to detect emissions from black holes obscured by thick clouds of gas and dust. Findings suggest up to 35% of supermassive black holes are hidden, a significant increase from earlier estimates. These discoveries highlight the importance of advanced infrared and X-ray technologies in revealing the unseen aspects of the universe and improving our understanding of how these massive entities regulate star formation and influence the structure of galaxies. Scientists believe these observations may reshape theories of cosmic evolution.

A recent study suggests that an interstellar object, possibly as massive as eight times Jupiter, may have passed through the solar system billions of years ago, significantly altering the orbits of its outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Using computer simulations, researchers found that in about 1% of the scenarios, such a close encounter could explain the planets’ unusual orbital paths and deviations from circular orbits. This hypothesis challenges previous explanations centered on planetary interactions and suggests that flybys of substellar objects might be more common in the cosmos than once thought. The study's findings provide new insights into the potential forces that have shaped the structure of the solar system over time

A new study has revealed a hidden mechanism that could explain how creeping stress along tectonic plates can lead to catastrophic earthquakes. The research, involving laboratory experiments with plexiglass, found that slow, aseismic movements at fault lines can build up energy. Once a critical point is reached, the energy is released suddenly, triggering an earthquake. This discovery could help in predicting seismic events by detecting the transition from slow-moving stress to rapid rupture

These anomalies were discovered far from tectonic activity zones, raising questions about their origin. Researchers speculate that these blobs could be remnants of ancient crust or dense material formed billions of years ago. The findings are significant for understanding Earth's internal structure and may offer new insights into the planet's geological history. While their exact nature remains unclear, ongoing research aims to uncover the material properties behind these mysterious anomalie.
