However, the small increase in performance compared to less expensive variants does not justify the high price premium in most cases. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main reasons why a flagship processor is often not the best choice is the price. Flagship products are usually overpriced \u2014 and CPUs are no different. The price jump from the mid-range to the top segment is often moderate, but you pay a disproportionately high premium for the final step to the top model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Intel, for example, the Core i9-14900K costs almost 50 percent more than the Core i7-14700K, while the increase in performance is only minimal.

However, this year at CES, Lenovo announced that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2566195/lenovo-has-removed-its-iconic-trackpoint-nub-from-new-thinkpad-laptops.html\">ditching the nub on the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition laptops</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a surprising move and although Lenovo\u2019s not removing the nub on every single laptop at this time, who knows what the future holds. It\u2019s entirely possible Lenovo may completely phase out the TrackPoint nub in the next couple of years. So, as a way to celebrate the nub, let\u2019s dive into its long and sometimes complicated history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2566211/lenovo-newest-thinkbook-laptop-unrolls-for-extra-screen-space.ht",
