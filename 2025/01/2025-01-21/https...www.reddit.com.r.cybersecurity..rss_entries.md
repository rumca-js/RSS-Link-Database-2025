<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all, sorry for the lack of a better title. What I want to discuss in this post is where the Threat Detection and Response (TDR) market is headed. </p> <p>I use TDR to describe the ability to detect and respond to a breach, wether that&#39;s through the use of SIEM, EDR, NDR, XDR, SOAR, internal SOC, MDR service etc.</p> <p>I am also aware that there is not a single right solution and it will be depend on the environment. </p> <p>Before the golden era of EDR began, Detection and Response capabilities were centralized on a traditional SIEM solution like Splunk, ingesting and normalizing system event logs like windows event log, sysmon, firewall logs etc. and then building detection rules on these.</p> <p>With the evolution of EDR, it has become a central part of TDR for some organisations while for some, the SIEM is still the central part. Before you comment that it doesn&#39;t have to be one or the other, read the whole post.</p> <p>You alway

## Employee monitoring software

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my company is considering employee monitoring software. Long story short we had a disgruntled employee steal some documents on their way out the door. Both owners I think are in a really good mindset about the software - they don&#39;t care if you&#39;re apply to other jobs, reading reddit, or anything like that, but they need to be able to identify stolen documents. I think that makes sense. In 99% of scenarios we wouldn&#39;t be looking to press charges, just send a strongly worded letter and notify effected clients if necessary.</p> <p>The idea of monitoring software came from our IT provider. My only hesitation is that he is unfortunately kind of an idiot. I am more or less worried it will not be properly implemented and do what we need. For example, when we moved our exchange service to Microsoft from in-house it never occurred to him to set up MFA. Someone&#39;s email was hacked as a result. Constant issues with him like this.</p> <p>As to t
