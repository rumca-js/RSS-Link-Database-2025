It absolutely breaks my heart to see the man that is supposed to represent you essentially tell you right to your face on national television that starting today, you legally don&#39;t exist. That is bullshit.</p> <p>You exist, you matter, you are important, and you belong here. A pen and paper will not change that fact. They spew their lies that it&#39;s &quot;not about trans erasure it&#39;s about protecting the children&quot; when the rapant transphobia I&#39;ve seen online today has said otherwise.</p> <p>I may not completely understand how you are feeling, but you have my sympathy.
