Long story short we had a disgruntled employee steal some documents on their way out the door. Both owners I think are in a really good mindset about the software - they don&#39;t care if you&#39;re apply to other jobs, reading reddit, or anything like that, but they need to be able to identify stolen documents. I think that makes sense. In 99% of scenarios we wouldn&#39;t be looking to press charges, just send a strongly worded letter and notify effected clients if necessary.</p> <p>The idea of monitoring software came from our IT provider. My only hesitation is that he is unfortunately kind of an idiot. I am more or less worried it will not be properly implemented and do what we need. For example, when we moved our exchange service to Microsoft from in-house it never occurred to him to set up MFA. Someone&#39;s email was hacked as a result. Constant issues with him like this.</p> <p>As to t",
