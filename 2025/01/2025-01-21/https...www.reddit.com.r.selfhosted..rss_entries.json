Now i want to get next cloud aswell. But trying to get it on my plex server , i was about to ruin it with the settings from the nextcloud instalatuons. And i decided to return everything to the previous backup.</p> <p>Now i am thinking to get something cheap from the internet and get truenas on it. Looking to get a Nipogi E1 minipc N150 with 32gb ram. I saw one on the internet close by to me for about $220 .</p> <p>My question is as such: will truenas scale work on it with the installation on the m.2 and as the storage to get a 2tb ssd sata?</p> <p>This is to learn and test the stuff up so i wont have issues when ill try to get it on my main server.

It\u2019s simple and does what I need it to do, however I\u2019m simply curious as to the alternatives. I do have some family and friends who wish to use it aswell and their main concern was security and privacy. That\u2019s something I honestly believe FileBrowser is lacking. I tried out ZipLine and it seems cool but I\u2019m just wondering what you guys like to use for file storage and sharing if anything at all?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Makhd0m\"> /u/Makhd0m </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i6ez2k/filebrowser_alternative/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i6ez2k/filebrowser_alternative/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I was hoping there&#39;s a selfhosted solution out there that you guys are aware of that could help me simplify this for me.</p> <p>Ideally, I would search for an item I want to buy and it will show me all of the stores that item is available at and the prices as well. If I could sort by price that would be wonderful. But I really want to be able to perform just one search and get all the prices (even if it&#39;s just the mainstream stores) instead of searching one by one like <code>&lt;item&gt; walmart</code> or <code>&lt;item&gt; bestbuy</code> or <code>&lt;item&gt; target</code>, etc.</p> <p>It&#39;s not a huge pain but I figured someone must have already built a solution for such a common thing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hirakath\"> /u/hirakat",
