  <p id="ISKNjd">A video on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html">Nintendo’s Switch 2 website</a> shows how the trigger (or is it a button?) on the back of the Joy-Con controllers disconnects them from the console, as spotted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/511597/switch-2-nintendo-joy-con-remove-detach">by <em>Polygon</em></a>.</p>
<p id="YIJAsX">In the video, the trigger is pressed down a tad before a final push releases it from the console. As the Joy-Con moves away, you can also see a small cylinder receding back into the top part of the inside of the controller; to me, that indicates that when you push the trigger, you’re actually pushing out that cylinder to help bump the Joy-Con out. </p>
