Characters were talking aimlessly, there seemed to be no end or beginning to any conversation etc.</p> <p>Now, like I said, I just read 50 pages, and sure it could get better, but just wanted to ask the people here..does it get better? I really wanted to give this series a go. Want to get other people&#39;s opinions on this, does the series and writing get better with time? Or is it more of the same?</p> <p>Would also be happy if someone could suggest other books of such genres, where a detective solves a case. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",

I still like most of my characters to be talkative triple-crossing humans. It&#39;s a genre I&#39;m not very well versed in, but for some reference, I really enjoyed the short stories of James Tiptree Jr, in particular &quot;Mamma Come Home&quot; which has a faint whiff of government/intelligence people as they work with aliens. I also really really love Metal Gear. I&#39;m currently thinking about getting into John Le Carr\u00e9, I&#39;ve heard his books have a lot of the Jargon and detail that I love to get immersed into. I love good dialogue. One billion bonus points if there&#39;s gay men in it.</p> <p>Edit: also really loved Foundation. It didn&#39;t focus on &quot;espionage&quot; per say, but it had a lot of moving ",

I really want to read romance novels, but unfortunately for me I\u2019m a gay man, and this severely limits my book options(finding relatability in straight protagonists is difficult).

All of that to say; Is there such a thing as gay Bridgerton, or any gay period piece, on the market? And please, if possible, perhaps no Y/A? I don\u2019t mean to sound stuck up, but a majority of queer books I\u2019ve noticed are Y/A. I am not the Y in that A and am looking for something a little more up my age range alley.

I&#39;ve always been an avid reader, but I typically lean toward high fantasy; I&#39;m trying to broaden my horizons, and thought starting with my favorite shows would be a good building block. I&#39;m fine with YA or Adult Fiction and prefer books with a darker, morally grey vibe.</p> <p>My favorite shows are: Supernatural, Miracles, South of Hell, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville, The Secret Circle, and Teen Wolf. Feel free to ask any additional questions if anything isn&#39;t clear :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cm9313740\"> /u/cm9313740 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i67yuo/books_similar_to_supernatural_south_of_hell_etc/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1i67yuo/books_similar_to_supernatural_south_of_hell_etc/\">[comments]</a></span>",
