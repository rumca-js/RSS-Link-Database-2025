However, it is likely to still have a significant impact on religious organisations and human beliefs.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a youtube channel called Fern-TV out of the netherlands that has recently had a ton of growth. They mostly do 3d Blender animated true crime type videos or video essays. Some of the videos have voice over from a guy with a german accent, but some of the videos are voiced over by an American accent. I have recently heard the exact same American voice on a number of other channels with similar content. I believe it to be an AI voice like ElevenLabs, but I&#39;m curious if anyone knows the specific voice software or name of the AI voice. It sounds incredibly good, and I never would have assumed it was AI until I heard it on multiple other channels. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mattbothell"> /u/Mattbothell </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i6grth/does_anyone_know_what_ai_generated_voice_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, I&#39;m working on a feature within my SaaS application. Basically, the user should be able to upload a PDF to the web app and get back values for predefined fields. These PDFs are of the same type but greatly vary in layout, language, and data formats. You can imagine them as something like safety guidelines for washing gel, but from any country in the world.</p> <p>Our tech stack uses Azure as a cloud provider, so naturally, I went there and discovered Azure Document Intelligence. It looks like I should use their custom model, as none of the prebuilt ones suit my use case. So, this all looked pretty straightforward until I tried to upload a few of the PDFs into ChatGPT with a simple prompt like &quot;Extract A, B, C fields from this document,&quot; and the results were really accurate.</p> <p>So here&#39;s my question: Why would I use Azure Document Intelligence over ChatGPT in this case? What are the potential downsides?</p> </div><!--
