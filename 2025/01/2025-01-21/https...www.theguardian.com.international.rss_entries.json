Taking place over two days, what the film captures, without overtly talking about it too much, is his father\u2019s experience of dementia, and the gradual dismantling of the intellectual faculties that have been so important to him throughout his life. In a sense the film is about the process of erosion: dementia is not a fixed state condition, but a gradual slippage, and not even a linear slippage at that. Horst has better days and some memories that remain clear, even as other important facets of his life trickle away from him like sand in an hourglass.</p><p>Horst\u2019s house is the main location",
