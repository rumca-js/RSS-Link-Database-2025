<p>Long before Taco Tuesday became part of the pop-culture vernacular, Tuesdays were synonymous with security — and for anyone in the tech world, they still are.  Patch Tuesday, as you most likely know, refers to the day each month when Microsoft releases security updates and patches for its software products — everything from Windows to Office to SQL Server, developer tools to browsers.</p>



<p>The practice, which happens on the second Tuesday of the month, was initiated to streamline the patch distribution process and make it easier for users and IT system administrators to manage updates.  Like tacos, Patch Tuesday is here to stay.</p>

<p>Today’s AI models do a poor job of providing accurate information about world history, according to a <a href="https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/97439" data-type="link" data-id="https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/97439">new report from the Austrian research institute Complexity Science Hub</a> (CSH).</p>



<p>In an experiment, OpenAI’s GPT-4, Meta’s Llama, and Google’s Gemini were asked to answer yes or no to historical questions — and only 46% of the answers were correct. GPT-4, for example, answered “yes” to the question of whether Ancient Egypt had a standing army, likely because the AI model chose to extrapolate data from other empires such as Persia.</p>

<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has said it is unlikely to equip its new US plant in Arizona with its most advanced chip technology ahead of its Taiwan factories, raising concerns about supply-chain hurdles for tech companies.</p>



<p>Speaking at a university event in Taiwan, TSMC CEO and Chairman C.C. Wei attributed the delays at TSMC’s Arizona factory to a combination of complex compliance requirements, local construction regulations, and extensive permitting processes, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-us-plant-unlikely-get-latest-chip-tech-before-taiwan-ceo-says-2025-01-17/">Reuters report</a>. </p>
