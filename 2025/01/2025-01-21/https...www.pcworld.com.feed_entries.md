<p>If you own a Qualcomm-powered Snapdragon Copilot+ PC and are willing to run one of Microsoft’s test builds, a new feature is available: smarter semantic search, where you can describe what you’re looking for on your PC without the need for specific keywords.</p>



<p>Semantic search was first revealed in October, when Microsoft <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2472069/windows-holiday-plans-include-ai-photo-upscaling-smart-file-search.html">outlined its AI roadmap</a> that included Generative Fill and image upscaling. Now, it’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/01/17/previewing-improved-windows-search-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/">part of the latest Dev Channel build</a> for Windows Insiders, which was released at the end of last week. Only PCs with a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip inside can run it, howe

<p>Electronic Arts is one of the most notable publishers in the video games industry. Not only does it own extremely successful franchises like <em>EA Sports FC</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, and <em>Dragon Age</em>, the company also plays a key role in setting trends in the games market.</p>



<p>For a long time, EA games could only be purchased, downloaded, and played digitally via EA Origin (at least on PCs). Eventually, some titles became available on Steam. Now, EA is altogether discontinuing Origin, which will be effective April 17, 2025.</p>



<p>By then, you’ll need to switch to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-app">EA app</a>, which has been available since 2020 and serves as the new launcher for EA’s games. The switch is necessary to continue using purchased games and save data.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever become “stuck” in a game, the new Microsoft Edge Game Assist for Windows offers a pretty convenient way to help yourself out: Simply look up a hint while playing.</p>



<p>Microsoft debuted this new system as a beta during the holidays last year. Now, it’s part of Microsoft Edge itself, provided that you have the current version, Edge 132 or higher. (Technically, Game Assist is still a “preview.”)</p>



<p>For those of you who want a “pure” gaming experience, don’t worry. Edge Game Assist doesn’t just launch itself, and it actually seems rather helpful when you invoke it. Edge Game Assist is part of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/403529/microsoft-windows-10-game-bar-enhancements.html">Windows’ Game Bar, whose advanced features</a> have been available for, wow, five years already?</p>

<p>Nvidia’s GeForce Now is an easy and convenient way to play PC games if you don’t actually have a gaming PC, or you can’t fit a 30-pound desktop into your carry-on luggage. But at the moment you’re going to have a hard time getting into the service if you don’t already have a subscription. Most of the options for GFN are currently sold out due to high demand. </p>

<p>If you’re ready to upgrade your home office setup, then you should know this 27-inch Asus monitor is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Gaming-1440P-Monitor-VG27AQ3A/dp/B0BZR9TMBJ/">on sale right now for $199</a> and it might just be the exact budget-friendly monitor you need.</p>



<p>This Asus monitor delivers great visuals with its 2560x1440p resolution, and at 27 inches this monitor is sizable but not so large that you can’t fit two of them side-by-side on your desk. The IPS panel also ensures gorgeous (and accurate) colors as well as wide viewing angles. </p>



<p>Plus, it’s gaming-ready with its 180Hz refresh rate, so your frame rates will be super smooth no matter how hectic things get on screen, and the low 1ms response time minimizes lag.</p>



<p>The Asus TUF gaming monitor comes with a DisplayPort, two HDMI, and 3.5mm audio ports, plus buil

<p>We love how thin and light laptops are nowadays, but that usually comes with a big compromise: fewer ports. Find yourself wishing that your laptop had more connectivity? Right now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Display-MacBook-Thinkpad-Laptops/dp/B0BQLLB61B/">this 5-in-1 Anker USB-C hub is only $19 on Amazon</a>. That’s 25 percent off!</p>



<p>This versatile Anker USB-C hub is just what your laptop needs to connect everything you need and do anything you want to do. It features a 100W Power Delivery port and another USB-C data port, plus two USB-A ports and a 4K30 HDMI port so you can connect an external screen.</p>



<p>What all that means is you can keep your laptop at 100 percent battery thanks to the 85W pass-through charging, while also plugging in a high-resolution display and other peripherals or storage drives. It’s compatible with prett

<p>OLED monitors are all the rage for PC gamers right now. But even if you’re ready to dive in with an upgrade, you don’t want to spend more money than you have to, right? Well, set your sights on this Samsung Odyssey OLED G8, a 34-inch ultrawide that’s <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/316046169633">going for just under $640 on eBay</a> — that’s almost half off its original $1,200 price.</p>



<p>At 34 inches and a semi-standard 3440×1440 resolution with 175Hz of refresh, the curved OLED G8 LS34DG856SNXZA is neither the biggest nor the fastest OLED monitor on the market, but it’s a great size for anyone who wants an upgrade over standard 1440p without pushing their graphics card to the breaking point. While this screen does support AMD FreeSync and standalone Wi-Fi-connected apps (a la Samsung’s smart televisions), note that it doesn’t support USB-C video.

<p>Hunting for a high-performance gaming laptop that won’t cost you an arm and a leg can be difficult. Well, your hunt can end now thanks to this Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 with a solid configuration that’s on sale.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-16-fhd-165hz-gaming-laptop-intel-13th-gen-core-i7-16gb-ram-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-512gb-ssd-eclipse-gray/6572582.p?skuId=6572582">this RTX 4070 gaming laptop is down to $1,100 at Best Buy</a>, a great price point for a powerful laptop that features this GPU.</p>



<p>Let’s back up a bit. I want to start off by mentioning that this Zephyrus G16 runs on an Intel Core i7-13620H processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s more than capable of running whatever daily apps you need for work and play. Need more RAM? You can later upgrade to 32GB on your own by swapping out the memory

<p>Windows 11 laptop users can finally rejoice thanks to Microsoft’s latest improvement: a much better battery status display.</p>



<p>Up until now, you could only see a battery level indicator in the bottom right-hand corner of the Windows 11 taskbar, and that indicator didn’t immediately show you the percentage of your battery’s charge. You had to hover your mouse cursor over the battery icon to see it, and you had to right-click to open the power and sleep settings.</p>



<p>Now, in a preview version of Windows 11 that’s currently available to Windows 11 Insiders, there’s an improved view of the battery status display, according to <a href="https://x.com/phantomofearth/status/1880368411261513892">this tweet</a> spotted by <a href="https://betanews.com/2025/01/20/windows-11-is-finally-getting-a-decent-battery-tool-heres-how-to-enable-it-so-you-know-how-m

<p>CES 2025 set up an old-fashioned graphics card battle between Nvidia and AMD, even if the latter showed up a little late. We know when the new RTX 50 series GPUs will debut (at the end of January) and we now know when <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2568373/amds-radeon-rx-9070-and-rdna-4-embrace-the-ai-revolution.html">AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT cards</a> will hit store shelves: March.</p>



<p>If you want a more specific date, well, you aren’t alone. But that’s as much as AMD vice president David McAfee (whom we’ve spoken with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2435929/amd-talks-ryzen-9000-controversy-we-were-as-puzzled-as-reviewers.html">on several occasions</a>) is willing to share at the moment, only barely improving on the “Q1” date that was announced at CES.</p>

<p>Flagship CPUs may be tempting at first glance, especially if you are building a gaming PC where budget is not an issue. However, the small increase in performance compared to less expensive variants does not justify the high price premium in most cases. </p>



<p>One of the main reasons why a flagship processor is often not the best choice is the price. Flagship products are usually overpriced — and CPUs are no different. The price jump from the mid-range to the top segment is often moderate, but you pay a disproportionately high premium for the final step to the top model.</p>



<p>At Intel, for example, the Core i9-14900K costs almost 50 percent more than the Core i7-14700K, while the increase in performance is only minimal. At AMD, the price difference between the individual levels is slightly lower, but even so, the price is much higher than the addi

## An ode to Lenovo’s TrackPoint, the little red nub with a storied history

<p>Lenovo’s iconic crimson red TrackPoint nub, which has been going strong for three decades, is a staple of ThinkPad laptops. However, this year at CES, Lenovo announced that it’s <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2566195/lenovo-has-removed-its-iconic-trackpoint-nub-from-new-thinkpad-laptops.html">ditching the nub on the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition laptops</a>. </p>



<p>It’s a surprising move and although Lenovo’s not removing the nub on every single laptop at this time, who knows what the future holds. It’s entirely possible Lenovo may completely phase out the TrackPoint nub in the next couple of years. So, as a way to celebrate the nub, let’s dive into its long and sometimes complicated history.</p>

<p>Ever since the ill-fated demise of Google Glass in 2015, there’s been a part of me itching to know how augmented reality (AR) glasses tech has advanced — and every now and then, I get a taste. For the last several years, I’ve watched as display technology has shrunken down to fit right within a pair of glasses, and I’ve gone hands-on with a handful of different types of head-mounted displays.</p>



<p>Whether you want to call them AR or XR glasses, these wearable displays offer stunning possibilities. But I’ve found there’s one big impediment that consistently stands in the way of me properly enjoying these devices, and it could hold back huge swaths of the population: the nose. </p>



<p>Right now, the many commercially available AR/XR glasses have a lot in common. My own experiences with popular models, including the <a href="https://pro.viture.com/">V
