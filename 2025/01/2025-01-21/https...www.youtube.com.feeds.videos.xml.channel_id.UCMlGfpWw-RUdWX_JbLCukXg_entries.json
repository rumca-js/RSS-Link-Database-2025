There are many concerns about the safety of our C++ language, and projects developed using it. Many improvements are being discussed, starting from handling of the low-level fundamental types, through updating the language rules (e.g., initialization), up to providing safer high-level abstractions in the library.\n\nThis lecture presents how the usage of a Modern C++ quantities and units library can improve the safety of the code we write every day. During the talk, Mateusz will describe all issues and possible solutions discussed in P2981: Improving our safety with a physical quantities and units library. Based on the examples developed with the mp-units project, the attendees will not only learn the obvious benefits of using such a library but also some less known safety features will",
