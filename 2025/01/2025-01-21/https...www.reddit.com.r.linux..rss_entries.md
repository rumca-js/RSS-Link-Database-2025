<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Switch is not easy, especially when comes to production , work and when I already get used to all the softwares on Windows for nearly 15 years. When I tried to switch to Linux even for my daily work pc, the biggest problem is usually find an alternative software that just works almost as good as on Windows, and have it fit into my work flow. </p> <p>So after like 3 years of learning and learning, now I&#39;m using Artix Linux comfortably on my desktop and CachyOS on my laptop. I feel using Windows is such a pain. My goal would be destroy windows in every pc I can touch on and trying to teach the owner to use Linux isntead, Linux mint would be the choice for newbies. I wish I started with Linux mint, but I started with Ubuntu then Arch. </p> <p>Windows has been such a pain now:</p> <pre><code>https://i.ibb.co/9YJ2sPP/4.jpg https://i.ibb.co/TWJLhpH/3.jpg https://i.ibb.co/Q8KjWN3/2.jpg https://i.ibb.co/LJMmVjR/1.jpg https://i.ibb.co/DzNSgYB/Shot-2025-01
