<p>I spent years desperate for help and exhausted from lack of sleep. But the condition is badly misunderstood – even by doctors</p><p>I’d always known something was wrong with my legs. When I was a teenager, my best friend and I shared her full-sized bed – she would wake me up, giggling: “Lying next to you is like trying to sleep through an earthquake!” Now I’m 45, and my boyfriend says the same thing.</p><p>I have Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), a condition that affects up to 14% of the global population, according to the <a href="http://rls.org">Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation</a>. Every night, I feel an uncontrollable urge to move my legs. I get up and walk – a trusty but temporary solution. It stops. I lie back down. It starts again. I try to ignore it, but I can’t. The movements persist in arrhythmic cycles for hours. By bedtime I’m exasperated, in tears. I just want to sleep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/21/restless-legs-syndrome-sleep-treatment">

The simple answer, he says, is to make a vegan bechamel, which can be achieved in one of two ways. The first comes courtesy of Bonita herself: “She makes a roux with plant-based gear, then flavours it with nutritional yeast to get those cheesy, umami vibes.” You can then adulterate this further, be that with some mustard powder (as Davies’ mother does), a grating of nutmeg or a pinch of cayenne.</p><p>A roux is also <a href="https://www.theguard

Taking place over two days, what the film captures, without overtly talking about it too much, is his father’s experience of dementia, and the gradual dismantling of the intellectual faculties that have been so important to him throughout his life. In a sense the film is about the process of erosion: dementia is not a fixed state condition, but a gradual slippage, and not even a linear slippage at that. Horst has better days and some memories that remain clear, even as other important facets of his life trickle away from him like sand in an hourglass.</p><p>Horst’s house is the main location
