Had to Ts4 via task manager.</p> <p>Then seeked help on Anadius&#39;s discord, followed the instructions up to where he said to move the ts4 folder from Documents to desktop. So I&#39;m basically just moving the folders that he specified one by one, from the Ts4 folder on the desktop to the original Documents folder and starting the game each time to see whats causing the black screen issue. The game was able to run fine on each restart. So at this point I&#39;m already guessing the issue might be with the mods.

It&#39;s worked amazingly, but one time, shortly into downloading it, my Bitdefender told me that there was malware in the program, and successfully quarantined it. I played it daily for years afterward.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2025. I still can&#39;t afford the video game in question, so on a fresh install of Windows 11 (I wanted to upgrade and lose all the fluff and dead weight files) I installed it once more, from the original file. I&#39;d previously tested it on a virtual machine and with Virus total, seemed okay. I thought perhaps the original flags on my Bitdefender could have been a false positive.</p> <p>Fast forward a week and a half, Bitdefender tells me the program has tried to execute a line of code in system32, and it&#39;s prevented it from happening. I look up said line of code, and find a page hosted by Avast for Crackonosh - <a href=\"https://decoded.",
