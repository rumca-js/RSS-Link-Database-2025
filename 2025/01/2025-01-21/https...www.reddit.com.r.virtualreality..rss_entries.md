<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys! I’m really conflicted because a family member is selling both a Meta Quest 2 and Rift S for only $100 each. He upgraded recently and wanted to get rid of his old headsets. He said he’d sell me the one if I wanted one and I said yes. My problem is, which one would be the better pick? I plan on using the headset strictly for PCVR, so I was looking for the best option out of the two. </p> <p>From what I’ve researched, the Quest 2 has a better display, but the Rift S has lower latency. I currently have a Rift, and have been playing games like Walking Dead and Half Life Alyx. I also just recently got into Skyrim VR modded because I never played the original(don’t judge me🤣). My PC currently has an i7-10700k, RTX 2080, and 48gb ram. I’ve been able to play all games on max graphics setttings except Half Life Alyx. I optimized it tho and can get around 40-50 fps at max graphics except for fog, which I have on medium. </p> <p>In your opinion, which

For those who’ve never heard of it: Darknet is a puzzle/strategy roguelike where you play as a cyberpunk hacker, inspired by the 80s/90s Hollywood vision of going “inside the network”.</p> <p>Maaaaybe it’s a little pompous to refer to my own game as a “classic”, but hear me out:</p> <ul> <li>Darknet was technically <em>the first</em> full game to launch on an Oculus headset (in 2014!)</li> <li>It won a bunch of awards (Oculus VR Jam, IndieCade, Proto Awards)</li> <li>For years I’ve been getting emails from old players who wanted to play it on Quest</li> </ul> <p>So I hope that’s fair! I’ve made 5 more VR games since then (e.g. Ironlights &amp; Ironstrike) but Darknet still feels like one of my best, and I hope you’ll agree it holds up if you get a chance to try it out.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Backstory:</strong><br/> I was bored and found an app on my phone called &quot;Superfy&quot; which essentially is an app where you can go to and get almost immediate answers from other people on the app or by the Superfy Bots.<br/> And whenever I asked the question &quot;Does anyone wanna play Pavlov VR SND?&quot; I got a<br/> reply from someone saying that they wanted to play, but we eventually realized we couldn&#39;t because they were on PSVR (PlayStation VR) which uses the PC version of Pavlov<br/> whereas I was using A standalone headset which uses a version called &quot;Pavlov Shack&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Reasoning:</strong><br/> This made me realize how much of VR I am limited on and am missing out on just because I don&#39;t have a high end desktop computer, so I went on Newegg and found a pre built called the ABS Cyclone which Carter PC&#39;s said is a good one for the price (<a href="https://www.newegg.com/abs-ca13400f4060-cyclone-aq

## Gaming is not currently VR’s ultimate use case

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I ordered the Quest 3S this morning and it arrived in the evening, so this is just my first reaction. Initially, I was a little disappointed by the first couple games I played. But then I discovered Theater Elsewhere in my apps—and it’s difficult for me to explain how blown away I was. Even tiny 3 second looping animations are breathtaking because you can get up close and look at them from all angles. So you can imagine how powerful the longer narrative animations are. VR technology is awesome, but it needs artistry to come alive. And 3D modeling and immersive animation is where that artistry is. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jaqueslouisbyrne"> /u/jaqueslouisbyrne </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i6ecf2/gaming_is_not_currently_vrs_ultimate_use_case/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1i6ecf2/gaming

Also does the face and eye tracking work through virtual desktop. I was thinking about getting a quest pro over a quest 3 because i want eye and face tracking and heard foveated rendering helps with performance also the lower resolution would be easier for my pc to run.

## I regret doing the Koss Porta Pro mod on my Vive Deluxe Audio Strap

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just thought I&#39;d post this here for anybody looking into doing the mod. Basically, you get a set of Porta Pro&#39;s, take the drivers out and trim the housing and replace the DAS speakers with the Porta Pros. Unfortunately for me, while it helpfully improved the Bass and toned the treble down a touch, the treble feels downright muted now and I may have actually lost a touch of overall volume too. It&#39;s not terrible, it&#39;s fairly similar to the original sound but just.. different. In some scenarios, its a little better. Problem is that it&#39;s not <em>$80 canadian dollars better</em> and I kind of wish I&#39;d not done the mod because it&#39;s destructive to the Koss drivers housing.</p> <p>I&#39;d probably consider this a non-issue if I could fix the treble a bit or install an EQ, but neither seem possible.</p> <p>Apparently along the way somewhere, I had misremembered the sound of the Rift CV1 and it wasn&#39;t as mind-blowing as I&#39;d
