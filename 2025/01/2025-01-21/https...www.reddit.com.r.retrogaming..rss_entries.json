If you\u2019re curious about the details or feel inspired to support the initiative, I\u2019d love for you to check it out\u2014there are some really exciting rewards waiting for backers!</p> <p>Here\u2019s the link to the project: <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lawrencebrd/nsone\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lawrencebrd/nsone</a></p> <p>Tha",

The controls are bizarre to get used to. The wall-climbing is insanely hit or miss and you often get stuck to random objects just trying to move. The energy level that determines the power (?) and range of your attack resets when you die which is especially rough on the final boss rush level, and the timer can legitimately screw you while dealing with all this. Regardless, this is a genuinely fun game despite the issues. I started tonight just to check if I wanted to play it tomorrow\u2026but ended up stuck to it until I finished it lol. It\u2019s addictive af. The levels aren\u2019t too long which just keeps you coming back, getting a little farther eac",

A fun little challenge I have for myself is I\u2019m allowed to use each available character once to try to beat the game. Still haven\u2019t beaten any but I\u2019ve come close with Warrior Blade (really awesome game btw).

I felt they were legit read reviews and saw they were partnered with Shopify. The same day I placed the order I received the notification that my order was ready to ship. The shipping details said 1-5 days so I\u2019m starting to wonder if it was a scam. Does anyone have any insight into them or how long it takes things to ship from Canada to the US?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fresh_Addendum_1412\"> /u/Fresh_Addendum_1412 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i665oe/has_anyone_purchased_from_retro_replay_in_ontario/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i665oe/has_anyone_purchased_from_retro_replay_in_ontario/\">[comments]</a></span>",
