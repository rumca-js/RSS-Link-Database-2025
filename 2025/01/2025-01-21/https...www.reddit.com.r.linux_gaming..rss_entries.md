I think the ASrock B650E has intel but that is also 2x the price of any other B650 in my country.

I&#39;m guessing the icon would need to point to a script or something, but I&#39;m not sure even where to look for how to achieve this.</p> <p>Also, I have not had the chance to actually look into how the Steamdeck does it, but I will be doing so.

## Why isn't PC emulation more of a thing, compared to console emulation which is in a great shape?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I mostly use my PC for playing native PC games, but I have been doing a little bit of emulation recently. Console emulation on PC is in a really decent shape nowadays. You can play PS1, PS2 and PS3 video games with no issue, although the latter console will require a powerful CPU for some titles (I have a Ryzen 5 2600 and I am getting like 17-18 FPS in God of War 3). This is truly a marvel to behold. And what&#39;s more, all of those emulators work perfectly on Linux.</p> <p>My question is, why can&#39;t we really emulate older PC&#39;s/operating systems?</p> <p>So for example, I have at least two games on CD/DVD that I would really like to be playing that don&#39;t really work that well on modern systems. One of them is the Sims Medieval from 2010, I think. This game has very strict disc-based DRM that doesn&#39;t work on modern operating systems, be it Linux or Windows. I think this is a lost cause, unfortunately. The only way to get this game r

Anyway, i do some light gaming on it and the games seemed to load faster than in Windows most of the time, but yesterday some games seemed to crash right when it was loading up or a few seconds after loading. The main tow games this consistently happened were Genshin Impact on Lutris and Left 4 Dead 2 on Steam(which i dont think are graphically intensive games).

I tried to launch dota2 with steam (deb) and didnt worked, I tried with steam(flatpak) didnt worked also , I tried with Gnome wayland,Gnome X11, KDE Plasma wayland,KDE Plasma x11 still nothing is working ....
