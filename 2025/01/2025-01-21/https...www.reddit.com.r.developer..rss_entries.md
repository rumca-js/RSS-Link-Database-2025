<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can you recommend a convenient place to store snippets? I&#39;m currently trying out Cacher since it also has a field for adding descriptions. Maybe there&#39;s something better that I haven&#39;t discovered yet. I need the option to add tags/labels and descriptions. I&#39;ll try to stick with a free plan since I&#39;m just starting to create some scripts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StarlightSurfer-"> /u/StarlightSurfer- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i6lm6x/snippet_library_websitesoftware/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1i6lm6x/snippet_library_websitesoftware/">[comments]</a></span>
