First, look at the beginning of the error message, which tells you what went wrong at a very low level. Then skip over the intermediate errors that follow the chain of calls until you end up at the line of code that&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;wrote. That original line of code is the one that is leading the compiler to a bad place. After that, you sometimes get supplemental information that helps you understand the low-level error better.</p>
