Batteries don\u2019t last forever \u2014 whether they\u2019re in your phone, EV, or laptop. Extending battery life is a major engineering challenge, but what if there was a battery that could last over 100,000 cycles? A battery that could go an entire lifetime with little to no degradation? Imagine guaranteeing performance not just for years \u2014 but decades. Well, a team in Germany might have just made it a reality, turning a notoriously short-lived battery into one of the longest-lasting ever. How did scientists pull this off? And more importantly, when can we start seeing these batteries in our phones and EVs?\n\nWatch How a Small Wind Turbine Will Revolutionize Wind Energy https://youtu.be/sl8UVOpzo7Q?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-zinc-batteries-are-defying-limits/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://li",
