<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Was excited to read this autobiography.. started well. John&#39;s School days, Cambridge College, Footlights.. and then reams and reams about the various stage plays and revues. As I progressed through the book and the remaining pages got fewer and fewer it slowly dawned on me with horror. There is next to nothing about Monty Python in this book. No Fawlty Towers. No Life of Brian. No Clockwise. No Time Bandits. No Fish Called Wanda. in fact the narrative barely makes it out of the 1960&#39;s. I would have been ok with this if I was prepared for it, but I just ended up disappointed. Hopefully one day there will be a Volume II</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/raresaturn"> /u/raresaturn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i6vt6f/so_anyway_john_cleese_what_a_strange_strange_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i6vt6f/so_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just finished this 30-year-old book and wanted to discuss it, but couldn&#39;t find any good discussions on it. After completing the book, despite what Grisham was trying to accomplish, IMO, Grisham only proves Death Row inmate Sam Cayhall deserves to die! </p> <p>Despite my warning of &quot;spoilers&quot;, IMO, it&#39;s impossible to spoil this legal drama, though I&#39;ll use spoils for everything outside the initial premise. In the first few chapters (and as explained in the back cover), you find out that Sam Cayhall, with the help of his Klu Klux Klan buddies, plants bombs all along the south to terrorize Civil Rights supporters, and in one bomb in the 60&#39;s he accidentally kills two kids and maims a lawyer. Sam initially escapes justice and walks free due to racism, but by the 80&#39;s feelings have changed and a politically savvy prosecutor tries the old Klu Klux Klan member, who is then found guilty and gets the death penalty.

One was <span class="md-spoiler-text">the murder of Jules, the new recruit on sentry duty, who had been longing very much to be put on leave and reunite with his mother and sister in his hometown</span>.
