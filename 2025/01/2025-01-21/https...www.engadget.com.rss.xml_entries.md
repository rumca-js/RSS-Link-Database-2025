<p>The TikTok ban may have lasted only a few hours (at least for now), but Meta is still trying to capitalize on its rival’s tenuous future. Meta has rolled out a new “<a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://creators.facebook.com/breakthrough-bonus"><ins>breakthrough bonus program</ins></a>” that offers up to $5,000 to creators who are new to the company’s apps.</p>
<p>According to Meta, the bonus program is open to US adults who “have an existing presence on a third party social app that you can link or already have linked during the application process.” Participants will also be required to create a professional account on Instagram and a page on Facebook.</p>

<p>Instagram blocked searches related to a number of political hashtags, including #democrats, #democrat, #jan6th, #republicans and a number of other terms Tuesday. Users who searched for these hashtags were instead greeted with a notice that “we’ve hidden these results" because they "may contain sensitive content."</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly how many search terms were affected but users on Reddit reported that <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1i6fgzg/happening_now_instagram_is_now_blocking/"><ins>dozens of tags</ins></a><em>&nbsp;</em>were unsearchable.

<p>TikTok (and other ByteDance apps) went offline late Saturday, but the TikTok outage only lasted a matter of hours. Trump affirmed there would be “no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.” Trump also proposed a joint venture that would see US interests take a 50 percent stake in TikTok.

<p>If it feels like every piece of home tech is now “smart,” you’re not far off. The smart home space has grown exponentially in the past few years to include speakers, cameras, locks, lights and even kitchen appliances. There are also different voice assistants and IoT standards to consider, all of which can make it confusing (to say the least) to build your smart home ecosystem from the ground up.<br><br>Allow us at Engadget to help with that. We’ve tested dozens of smart home gadgets over the years and continue to test the latest offerings to see which work well and are worth your money. We recommend, before you even dive in, to resist the urge to outfit your whole home in one go. Not only can this be quite expensive, but also we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them. You should also pick a preferred voice assistant and stick with it. If you’re at the point where you’re ready to invest in a few new IoT gadgets, below are the best smar
