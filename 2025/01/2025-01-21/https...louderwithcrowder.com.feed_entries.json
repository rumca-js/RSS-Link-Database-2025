However, she lacks critical thinking, as people are entitled to change their minds, as not everyone is a mindless monolith like her. </p><p>Additionally, it does his career no favors to be tolerant toward Trump so it\u2019s almost certain that no one told him to do what he did. His managers probably advised against it. However, according to Ana, this still makes him a \u201ctrained seal\u201d even though he acted under his free will.</p><div class=\"rm-em",
