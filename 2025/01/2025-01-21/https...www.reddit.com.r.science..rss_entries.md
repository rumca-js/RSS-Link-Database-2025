## Cycle of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef now at ‘catastrophic’ levels - Study of 2023-2024 global marine heatwave found 66% of colonies were bleached by February 2024 and 80% by April. By July, 44% of bleached colonies had died, with some coral experiencing a staggering 95% mortality rate.
