<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Potato: A Lightweight Tool for Debugging and Testing Python Code</h1> <h2>What is Potato?</h2> <p><strong>Potato</strong> is a Python package designed to halt your code&#39;s execution with precision and simplicity. It’s perfect for debugging, testing control flow, or adding a bit of fun to your scripts. The best part? You don’t even have to install it. Python natively supports Potato, thanks to its strict variable naming rules.</p> <p>Just type potato into your source code and watch the magic happen! Your script will immediately halt with a NameError, leaving your colleagues (or future self) wondering why there&#39;s a potato in your code.</p> <h2>Why Potato?</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Zero Dependencies</strong>: Potato requires absolutely no installations or updates.</li> <li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: Takes up 0 bytes of storage.</li> <li><strong>Instant Debugging</strong>: Clearly marks the exact point in your code where Potato strikes.</li> <li><
