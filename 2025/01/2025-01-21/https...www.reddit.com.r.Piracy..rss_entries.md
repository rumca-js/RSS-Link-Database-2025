<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Context. I have a good library of downloaded and ripped movies and cartoons in my Google Drive. I used to be able to watch it in my TV using Kodi or a file manager, but it looks like that option is not working anymore.</p> <p>So, I am testing the option to upload it to YouTube, keeping every video private (so it&#39;s not accessible to anyone but me).</p> <p>For now, it seems to be working. I have already uploaded 33 videos; almost all of them have received a &quot;blocked&quot; flag (total or parcial), but I can access them under &quot;my videos&quot;. Only two of them were completely removed due to rigths violation and I had to delete them.</p> <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that I am not the first one that had that idea, so... is there a catch? Can Google do something with that? Is it risky? Again, all of them are private, so it&#39;s basically the same thing as Google Drive (and in Drive they never did anything with me, they only flagged one of my videos
