        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For those who might be interested. I&#39;ve released an implementation of the Dshot protocol to control brushless motors from a Raspberry Pi 5. This implementation uses the recently released &#39;piolib&#39; library, which allows to program the RP1 microcontroller. Dshot values are generated by RP1 and do not overload the main CPU. </p> <p>Dshot protocol is more advanced than PWM. It is digitally accurate and does not require calibration. It allows a much higher update frequency. It allows to set the direction of rotation and to execute special commands such as beep (beacon).</p> <p>The implementation supports up to 26 motors and all versions of Dshot: 150, 300, 600 and 1200. It sends Dshot to all configured pins simultaneously.</p> <p>Available under the MIT license on Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/Marian-Vittek/raspberry-pi-dshot-pio\">https://github.com/Marian-Vittek/raspberry-pi-dshot-pio</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",
